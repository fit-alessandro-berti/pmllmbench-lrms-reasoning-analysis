Here is the abstract reasoning list that corresponds to the reasoning steps in your trace. These labels are generalized to enable process mining across multiple cases:

1. **Scenario Comprehension**  
2. **Sequential Modeling**  
3. **Loop Identification**  
4. **Decision Point Analysis**  
5. **Condition Abstraction**  
6. **Iterative Refinement**  
7. **Structural Validation**  
8. **Component Definition**  
9. **Flow Adjustment**  
10. **Token Dynamics Assessment**  
11. **Consistency Check**  
12. **Finalization**  

This abstracted list provides a high-level view of reasoning strategies that can be used for process mining. Let me know if further breakdown is needed!
