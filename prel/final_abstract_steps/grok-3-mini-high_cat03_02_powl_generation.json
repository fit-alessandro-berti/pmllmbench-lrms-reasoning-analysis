After the loop, an exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) or Monolithic Deployment (MD). 5.

In POWL, when I have a partial order, I can specify edges. For example, to have CS precede both DA and ACI, and then have the loop wait for both DA and ACI. But the loop is a sub-model, so I need to treat the loop as a single node in a higher partial order. Similarly for the XOR choice. So, probably, I need to build sub-POWL models and connect them with partial orders."

In POWL, I can represent concurrent blocks using StrictPartialOrder with no edges or specific edges. For example, for DA and ACI, I can have a StrictPartialOrder node with nodes DA and ACI, and no order edges, meaning they are concurrent. Then, the next part (the loop) must wait for this partial order node to complete, which in POWL means that when the partial order node is executed, all its sub-nodes are executed according to their partial order. Similarly for QA and SA."

BNC and D&R are activities, so they should be Transitions. Similarly, xor_choice is OperatorPOWL with Operator.XOR and children [CD, MD]. All activities are Transitions. Also, in the partial order, when I add edges, like SR -> CS, it means CS cannot start until SR is done."

From the example, in the advanced scenario, they had nodes including X(A,B), so yes. So, in code, I can do: root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, PO_DA_ACI, loop_node, xor_node, PO_QA_SA, GLA]) Then add edges: root.order.add_edge(SR, CS) root.order.add_edge(CS, PO_DA_ACI) root.order.add_edge(PO_DA_ACI, loop_node) root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node) root.order.add_edge(xor_node, PO_QA_SA) root.order.add_edge(PO_QA_SA, GLA)"

Since they have no internal order edges, and in POWL, a partial order node completes when all its nodes are done, I think thats handled by the POWL semantics. The description says: the target node cannot be executed before the source node is completed. And for a partial order node, it probably completes when all its sub-nodes and their dependencies are satisfied. Looking back at the POWL definition: in the example, PO=(nodes={NODE1, NODE2}, order={}) means they can be executed in parallel, and presumably, the partial order node is considered complete when all nodes are done. In the advanced example: PO with nodes including X(A,B), and orders specifying that X(A,B) waits for NODE1 and NODE2. In that case, when PO_DA_ACI is a source, it means that loop_node cannot start until PO_DA_ACI is complete, which should mean until both DA and ACI are done. Similarly for PO_QA_SA. So, I think this structure should work."

Now, create the sub-POWL models. First, the concurrent DA and ACI: PO_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI])  no need to add edges, so they are concurrent.
