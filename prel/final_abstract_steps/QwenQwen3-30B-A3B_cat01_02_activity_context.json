    "Text": "First, I need to look at each case and see which activities are repeated. Lets start with Case C001. The activities here are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, and Approve Request. So the same activity Verify Documents appears twice. Similarly, in Case C002, theres Verify Documents once, then Call Customer twice, and Adjust Account once. In Case C003, Verify Documents appears twice, and Call Customer once."

    "Text": "Now, the key is to figure out why these activities are repeated and what different contexts they have. For example, in C001, the first Verify Documents is when the agent checks the initial documents, but after the customer submits additional documents, theres another Verify Documents where the agent rechecks with the new info. So the context here is that the second verification is after additional documents are submitted."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Similarly, in C002, there are two Call Customer events. The first is to clarify an account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up after adjustments. So maybe the first is a Clarify Discrepancy and the second is a Confirm Adjustments."

    "Text": "Another example is Adjust Account in C002. Thats a single occurrence, but in C003, theres an Adjust Account as well. However, in the given data, Adjust Account only appears once in each case. So maybe thats not a repeated activity."

    "Text": "For Verify Documents, the first time is initial verification, and the second time is after additional documents are submitted. So renaming the second one to Verify Documents PostSubmission or ReVerify Documents. But the user wants the names to clearly reflect context. So maybe Verify Documents Initial and Verify Documents PostSubmission or ReVerify Documents."

    "Text": "Alternatively, look at the additional context. For example, in C001, Call Customer is to request missing docs. In C002, its to clarify account discrepancy. In C003, its to have the customer return. So each has a different reason. Therefore, the names should reflect the reason. So for C001: Call Customer Request Missing Docs, C002: Call Customer Clarify Discrepancy, C003: Call Customer Retrieve Customer."

    "Text": "Wait, looking at the data again: Case C002s activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Call Customer, Approve Request. So Verify Documents is only once here. So only in C001 and C003 does Verify Documents occur twice."

Let me check each case again: Case C001: Original activities: Verify Documents twice, Call Customer once. So rename the second Verify Documents to Verify Documents PostSubmission. Case C002: Call Customer twice. Rename the first as Call Customer Clarify Discrepancy and the second as Call Customer Confirm Adjustments. Case C003: Verify Documents twice. Rename the second as Verify Documents PostAdjustment."
