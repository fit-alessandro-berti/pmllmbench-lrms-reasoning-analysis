The activities here are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, and Approve Request. So the same activity \"Verify Documents\" appears twice. Similarly, in Case C002, there's \"Verify Documents\" once, then \"Call Customer\" twice, and \"Adjust Account\" once. In Case C003, \"Verify Documents\" appears twice, and \"Call Customer\" once."

For example, in C001, the first \"Verify Documents\" is when the agent checks the initial documents, but after the customer submits additional documents, there's another \"Verify Documents\" where the agent rechecks with the new info. So the context here is that the second verification is after additional documents are submitted."

So for C002, the first \"Call Customer\" would be \"Call Customer - Clarify Discrepancy\" and the second \"Call Customer - Confirm Adjustments\".
