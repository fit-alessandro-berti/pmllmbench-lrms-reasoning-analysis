Ensure formatting rules: use LaTeX for math expressions; no single dollar signs; use escaped parentheses for inline math: \\(...\\). For display math: \\(...\\). We should present anomalies clearly, then hypotheses, then verification queries. Let's craft: - Anomalies list with bullet points. - Hypotheses list. - Verification queries section with subpoints and code blocks. Use proper formatting. Also ensure code is properly formatted using Prettier print width 80 characters? We can just write standard SQL; but we can format nicely."
