    "Text": "1. Idea Generation (IG) seems like it should be present at the beginning, so maybe an init rule. 2. After IG, Design Draft (DD) would follow, making a succession rule from IG to DD. 3. Technical Feasibility Check (TFC) probably depends on DD being completed firstanother succession rule. 4. Cost Evaluation (CE) might need both DD and TFC before it can proceed, suggesting a precedence rule involving multiple activities. 5. Prototype Creation (PC) would require CEs approval, so maybe another precedence rule. 6. Laboratory Testing (LT) after PCsuccession again. 7. User Testing (UT) could be an alternative path to LT if there are parallel testing phases. 8. Approval Gate (AG) needs both LT and UT results before proceeding, implying a conjunction or coexistence of these tests. 9. Marketing Plan (MP) likely follows AGs approval. 10. Final Launch (FL) depends on MP being in place."

    "Text": "I need to structure all these into the appropriate keys of the dictionary. For each key like succession, Ill map the starting activity to the following one with support and confidence. Same for precedence, coexistence, etc. Also, consider if any activities must always exist (like IG) or never be absent (maybe FL), which would use existence and absence keys. Let me start building the dictionary step by step, making sure each rule type is correctly applied."
