Lets compute the duration for each case: Case 2001: Start: 2024-04-01 09:00 End: 2024-04-01 10:30 Duration: 1.5 hours Case 2002: Start: 2024-04-01 09:05 End: 2024-04-02 11:00 Duration: 25 hours 55 minutes (approx 25.92 hours) Case 2003: Start: 2024-04-01 09:10 End: 2024-04-03 09:30 Duration: 48 hours 20 minutes (approx 48.33 hours) Case 2004: Start: 2024-04-01 09:20 End: 2024-04-01 10:45 Duration: 1.42 hours (85 minutes) Case 2005: Start: 2024-04-01 09:25 End: 2024-04-04 14:30 Duration: 3 days 5 hours 5 minutes = 77 hours 5 minutes (approx 77.08 hours)"

Then from Request Additional Documents (ends at 14:00) to next event (Approve Claim) is 20 hours (until next day 10:00).

Then next Request Additional Documents at 17:00 same day (gap: 6h). Then gap until next day 16:00 (Approve Claim) -> 23 hours. Then gap until next day 09:00 (Pay Claim) -> 17 hours. For Case 2005 (High, Region B, Adjuster_Lisa): After Evaluate Claim (ends at 09:50 on 2024-04-01) -> next event Request Additional Documents at 11:30 (gap: 1h40m). Then next at 17:00 same day (gap: 5h30m). Then next at 15:00 next day (gap: 22 hours). Then gap until next day 10:00 (Approve Claim) -> 19 hours. Then gap until 14:00 same day (4 hours).

In process mining, event logs often record the timestamp of the event (which can be start or complete). But without more information, we use the timestamps as given and compute the time between consecutive events in the same case."

Because she handled two slow cases? - Region B: the high complexity case (2005) took the longest?"
