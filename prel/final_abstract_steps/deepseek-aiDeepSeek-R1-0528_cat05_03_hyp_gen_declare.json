Lets break down the model: declare_model = { init: { R: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0} }, existence: { C: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0} }, responded_existence: { E: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0, activities: [A]} }, precedence: { C: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0, activities: [R]} }, noncoexistence: { E: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0, activities: [C]} } } Explanation of constraints: 1. init: The process must start with activity R (Receive Claim). - This means every trace must have R as the first event. 2. existence: Every trace must contain at least one occurrence of activity C (Close Claim). - So every claim must be closed. 3. responded_existence: If activity E (Evaluate Claim) occurs, then activity A (Assign Adjuster) must occur (either before or after). - Note: This constraint does not specify the order, just that if E occurs then A must occur somewhere in the trace. 4. precedence: Activity C (Close Claim) must be preceded by activity R (Receive Claim). - This means that before a claim is closed, it must have been received. But note that the precedence constraint only requires that R occurs before C. It does not require that R is the immediate predecessor. 5. noncoexistence: Activity E (Evaluate Claim) and activity C (Close Claim) cannot coexist in the same trace. - This means that if a claim is evaluated (E) then it cannot be closed (C), and vice versa."

But what if a trace has E? Then it cannot have C. But the existence constraint requires that every trace has C. Therefore, if a trace has E, then it cannot have C, which violates the existence constraint. Conversely, if a trace has C (as required by existence), then it cannot have E. - Therefore, the noncoexistence constraint effectively forbids the occurrence of E in any trace because every trace must have C. This leads to a contradiction: if we have a trace with E, then we cannot have C, but we must have C. So the only possibility is that no trace has E. But then what about the responded_existence constraint? It says that if E occurs then A must occur. But if E never occurs, then the responded_existence constraint is vacuously satisfied."

However, the precedence constraint as written is not incorrect because R does happen before C in the intended flow. But note that the precedence constraint does not require the other steps (A, E, P, N) to occur. So it allows a trace that goes R then immediately C? But the noncoexistence constraint does not forbid that because if E is not present then having C is allowed. However, the intended flow requires E to occur? But the model does not require E to occur. Anomaly 4: The responded_existence constraint says that if E occurs then A must occur. But note that the intended flow has A occurring before E, which is acceptable. However, because of the noncoexistence constraint, E cannot occur at all (as explained in Anomaly 1). Therefore, the responded_existence constraint is never activated."

    "Text": "Hypotheses for why the model includes such anomalies: 1. Misinterpretation of business requirements: The business might have intended that claims that are evaluated (E) are not closed (C) because they are denied? But the intended flow says that after evaluation, the claim is approved and then closed. So this seems contradictory. Perhaps the model was designed for two types of claims: one that is evaluated and then denied (so not closed? but then what is the end state?) and one that is closed without evaluation? But the intended flow does not mention denial. Alternatively, the noncoexistence constraint might have been intended to apply to a different set of activities? For example, maybe they meant that an evaluation (E) and a denial (if there was a denial activity) cannot coexist with closing? But the model does not have a denial activity. 2. Incremental changes in policies: Initially, the process might have had two paths: one for simple claims that are closed without evaluation and one for complex claims that require evaluation. Then, a policy change might have mandated that all claims must be evaluated, but the old constraint of noncoexistence (from when evaluation meant denial) was not removed. 3. Technical issues or incomplete data: The data used to mine the DECLARE model might have been incomplete. For example, if the event log did not capture the evaluation step for some claims, then the model might have learned that evaluation and closing are mutually exclusive? But note the noncoexistence constraint has support and confidence 1.0, meaning it was always observed? Alternatively, the log might have contained only claims that were either closed without evaluation (due to being simple) or evaluated and then denied (and hence not closed? but then how was the claim ended?). 4. Pressure to handle claims quickly: The company might have introduced a fast-track for simple claims that bypasses evaluation, and the model reflects that. However, the intended flow still requires evaluation. This might lead to two types of traces: one following the full flow and one skipping evaluation. But the noncoexistence constraint forbids having both E and C in the same trace, which would be violated by the full flow."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Propose verification approaches using SQL: We have three tables: claims, adjusters, and claim_events. The claim_events table records the activities for each claim. We can write queries to check: 1. Claims that were closed without evaluation: - We want to find claims that have a C (Close) event but no E (Evaluate) event. 2. Traces where evaluation and closing coexist (which violates the noncoexistence constraint, but note: the intended flow requires both, so we expect many?): - We want to find claims that have both an E and a C event. 3. Claims that have an evaluation step without an assignment (to check the responded_existence constraint for E requiring A): - We want to find claims that have an E event but no A (Assign) event. 4. Claims that are closed without being received (to check the precedence constraint for C requiring R, but note the init constraint requires R to be first, so this should not happen?): - We want to find claims that have a C event but no R event? But note the init constraint says R must be the first, so every trace should have R. But we can check if there is a claim that has C without R? Actually, the precedence constraint only requires that R occurs before C, and the init constraint requires R to be present. So we can check for claims that have C but no R? That would violate both. However, note the precedence constraint in the model is only between R and C. We can also check if there are claims that have C occurring before R? But that would violate the init constraint as well. Lets write the SQL queries: Query 1: Claims closed without evaluation (i.e., have C but not E) SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = C ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = E ); Query 2: Claims that have both evaluation and closing (violating noncoexistence, but note: intended flow has both, so we expect these to be present) SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = E ) AND EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = C ); Query 3: Claims that have evaluation without assignment (violating responded_existence) SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = E ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = A ); Query 4: Claims that are closed without being received (should be none because of init and precedence, but lets check) SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = C ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = R ); Additionally, we might want to check the order of events? For example, for the precedence constraint between R and C: we require that R occurs before C. We can check for claims where the first event is not R? Or where C occurs before R? Query 5: Claims where the close event (C) occurs before the receive event (R) [should not happen] SELECT ce_c.claim_id FROM claim_events ce_c JOIN claim_events ce_r ON ce_c.claim_id = ce_r.claim_id WHERE ce_c.activity = C AND ce_r.activity = R AND ce_c.timestamp < ce_r.timestamp; But note: the init constraint requires R to be the first event, so C cannot occur before R. So this query should return nothing. However, note that the init constraint in DECLARE only requires that the first event is R. It does not prevent R from occurring again? But in our process, R should occur only once? We are not told. But the above query checks for any C event that occurs before any R event? Actually, we want to check if there is any claim that has at least one C event that occurs before an R event? But that would violate the precedence constraint (which requires that R occurs before C) and the init constraint (which requires R to be the first). So we can write: Alternatively, we can check for claims that have a C event and then later an R event? But that would be a problem. But note: the precedence constraint in the model is defined as: C must be preceded by R. So for every C event, there must be an R event that happened before it. We can check for C events that do not have a preceding R event in the same claim. Query 6: For each C event, check if there is an R event in the same claim that occurred before it. SELECT ce_c.claim_id, ce_c.timestamp as c_timestamp FROM claim_events ce_c WHERE ce_c.activity = C AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce_r WHERE ce_r.claim_id = ce_c.claim_id AND ce_r.activity = R AND ce_r.timestamp < ce_c.timestamp ); This query returns C events that do not have a preceding R event in the same claim. But note: the init constraint requires that the first event is R. So if a claim has an R event, then the first event must be R. Therefore, any event after that must have an R event before it. So the above query should return nothing? Unless there is a claim that does not have an R event at all? But then Query 4 would have found that claim. So we have: - Query 1: Claims closed without evaluation -> might be allowed by the model? Because noncoexistence doesnt forbid it? Actually, noncoexistence forbids E and C together, so if E is absent then C is allowed. So this is acceptable in the model. - Query 2: Claims that have both E and C -> these violate the noncoexistence constraint. So we expect none? But the intended flow requires both. So if we find any, then the noncoexistence constraint is violated in the data? Or if we find none, then the data does not have any evaluated claims that are closed? That would be a problem. - Query 3: Claims that have E without A -> these violate the responded_existence constraint. We expect none? But note: the responded_existence constraint says if E occurs then A must occur. So we should find none. - Query 4: Claims that have C without R -> these violate both init and precedence. We expect none. - Query 5: Claims where C occurs before R -> same as above, we expect none. - Query 6: C events without a preceding R event -> same as above, we expect none. But note: the model has a contradiction in the constraints. Therefore, we expect that the data must avoid having both E and C. So either: a) Claims are closed without evaluation (so they have C but not E) -> Query 1 returns some claims. b) Claims that are evaluated are not closed (so they have E but not C) -> we can write a query for that. Query 7: Claims that have evaluation (E) but not closed (C) SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = E ) AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = C ); We can run Query 2 and Query 7 to see if there are claims that have both (which are forbidden) and claims that have E without C (which are allowed by the model? because noncoexistence forbids E and C together, so if E is present then C must be absent). But note the existence constraint requires every claim to have C. So if a claim has E, then it must not have C? But then it violates the existence constraint. Therefore, the only possibility is that claims with E are not present? Or the existence constraint is not enforced? But the model says existence of C has support and confidence 1.0, meaning every claim must have C. Therefore, if a claim has E, then it must not have C -> but then it violates existence. So the model is inconsistent. Therefore, in the data, we must not have any claim that has E? Because if a claim has E, then it cannot have C (by noncoexistence) but must have C (by existence). So the only way is to not have E at all. So we can check: Query 8: Claims that have an evaluation event (E) at all SELECT c.claim_id FROM claims c WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events ce WHERE ce.claim_id = c.claim_id AND ce.activity = E ); If this returns any rows, then the data violates the model? Because the model requires that if E occurs then C cannot occur (noncoexistence) but also requires that C must occur (existence). So the claim must have C and cannot have C? Contradiction. Therefore, the model requires that E never occurs. So we expect Query 8 to return nothing. But the intended process flow includes E. So the model does not match the intended flow. In summary, the SQL queries can help verify: - Whether the data adheres to the model (which has contradictions) and whether the intended flow is followed."
