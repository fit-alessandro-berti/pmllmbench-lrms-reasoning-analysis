Since all activities are part of a single order process, maybe some steps are always done once? For example, when you receive an order (RO), you must check availability (CA). Since you can't check availability without receiving the order, but equivalence might not apply here. Maybe equivalence is between steps that must be done together. Let me think. For instance, if you reserve items (RI), then you must have checked availability (CA), but does that need to be an equivalence? Not sure yet. Maybe equivalence isn't a big part here unless there are steps that must be done in tandem. Maybe not applicable here, so perhaps no equivalence constraints?"

So for example, CA must always come before RI because you can't reserve items before checking availability. So (CA, RI) would be an Always Before pair. Similarly, RI must come before PI? Wait, after checking availability, you reserve, then pick. So RI comes before PI. Then PI must come before QC (you can't quality check before picking). QC before PO? Yes, packing only after quality check. Then PO before GSL? Probably, because you need the items packed to generate the shipping label. Then GSL before Dispatch (D). Dispatch must come after all the packing and labeling. Then, the invoice and payment steps: probably, after the order is shipped, you might invoice the customer, so Dispatch before IC. But sometimes invoices could be sent before shipping, but maybe in this process, it's after. Also, Record Payment (RP) might come after IC, but maybe it depends on payment method.

The constraint says: If activity A occurs, then activity B must have occurred before A. So for example, if we have (CA, RI), that means whenever RI happens, CA must have happened before.
