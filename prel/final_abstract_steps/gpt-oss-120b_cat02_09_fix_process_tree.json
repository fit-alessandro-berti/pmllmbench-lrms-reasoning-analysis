Match Invoice to PO 7. Pay Invoice 8. Close Case. The fixed model should retain all the same activities but enforce a sequence and structure that only allows the normal, domain-appropriate order of events."

By changing the parallel operator to a sequence operator for the core purchasing activities, the model will ensure that each step logically follows the previous one, thus preventing out-of-order executions and conforming to the domain logic."
