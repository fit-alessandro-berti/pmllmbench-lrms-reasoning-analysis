    "Text": "So the main issue is that steps 3 through 7 are happening in parallel allowing any order but they should follow a specific sequence Let me break down the proper flow After creating and approving the requisition you create the Purchase Order step 3 From there you need to receive the goods step 4 Once goods are received you can receive the invoice step 5 Then you match the invoice to the PO step 6 and finally you pay the invoice step 7 After all that you close the case"
