    "Text": "We need to analyze the event log for the Procure-to-Pay (P2P) process and identify anomalies. Lets first understand the standard P2P process flow: Standard P2P Sequence: 1. Create Purchase Requisition 2. Approve Purchase Requisition 3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) 4. Receive Goods (Goods Receipt) 5. Vendor Invoice Received 6. Match Invoice to PO (Three-way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) 7. Release Payment 8. Close Case Key principles: - Requisition must be approved BEFORE PO can be issued - PO should be issued BEFORE goods are received - Goods should be received BEFORE invoice is processed/paid - Invoice matching should occur before payment release - Payment should only be released after matching is complete"

Briefly explain the standard P2P flow 2. Identify anomalies case by case 3. Explain why each anomaly is problematic 4. Summarize the business risks I should be specific about the timestamp sequences and what violates standard practice."
