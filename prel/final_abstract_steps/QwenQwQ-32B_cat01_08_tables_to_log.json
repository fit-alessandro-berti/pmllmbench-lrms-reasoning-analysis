Since all rows are \"items picked\", just having \"Items Picked\" works, but the item specific info can be in the attributes.

So two events: dispatch on 2024-01-03 and arrival on 2024-01-05. Each with activity names \"Order Dispatched\" and \"Order Arrived\", and the carrier as a resource? The carrier is an ID here, but there's a resources table; maybe use the carrier name instead? Wait, the delivery note can be an additional attribute. The carrier_id can be linked to the resources table to get the carrier name. But since the resources have the carrier's name under resource_name, like CR-01 maps to GlobalTransport. So for the resource column in the event log, maybe the carrier's name as the resource? That would make sense since the delivery was dispatched via them. So in activity names for delivery events, the resource can be the carrier."
