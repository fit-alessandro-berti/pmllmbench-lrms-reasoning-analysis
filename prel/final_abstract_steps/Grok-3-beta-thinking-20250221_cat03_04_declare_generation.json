    "Text": "By correctly representing the sequence and dependencies of activities using 'exactly_one', 'init', and 'precedence', the model adheres to the process described in the prompt. The inclusion of (1.0, 1.0) for support and confidence reflects the assumption of perfect adherence to rules in this hypothetical scenario."
