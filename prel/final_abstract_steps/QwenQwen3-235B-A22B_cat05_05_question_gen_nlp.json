    "Text": "First, the supply chain starts with R&D, then sourcing components from various countries. Each supplier has different lead times and quality metrics. Then components go to Malaysia for assembly, then distribution via different methods to regional centers, and then to retailers or consumers. They use digital systems and data analytics throughout."

    "Text": "Hmm, I need to make sure the questions cover all stages. Let me go step by step. Starting with R&D: how does the design affect the supply chain? Maybe something about collaboration between R&D and suppliers. Then sourcing: risks of relying on specific countries, like geopolitical issues. Lead times and quality variations could be another angle. The assembly plant in Malaysia uses 24/7 shifts. What about labor challenges there? Also, automation's role. Quality checks during assembly how consistent are they across shifts? Transportation involves air and sea. How do they choose between them? Environmental impact of each. Customs and regulatory compliance are tricky; how do they handle delays? Distribution strategies: JIT vs monthly shipments. What are the risks of stockouts or overstocking? How do they forecast demand accurately? Local distribution centers breaking down shipments. How do they manage inventory across regions? Handling after-sales support and returns. Environmental and labor regulations compliance. How do they ensure sustainability? Carbon footprint reduction initiatives. Digital systems and data analytics: integration across different regions. Cybersecurity concerns. How machine learning models improve forecasting. Currency and time zone challenges. Contractual terms with suppliers negotiation strategies. Product recalls: process and impact. Continuous improvement initiatives measuring success."

    "Text": "That's 20. Let me see if these cover all aspects. Maybe some areas need more depth. For example, quality assurance protocols, regulatory compliance across countries, data analytics usage, etc. Also, implications of decisions, like what happens if they shift suppliers or change transportation modes. Potential issues like delays, costs, quality issues. Strategies like diversifying suppliers, improving forecasting, sustainability measures."

    "Text": "I think these questions should work. Let me ensure they're open-ended and not yes/no. Each should invite discussion on strategies, issues, improvements. For example, asking how the company mitigates geopolitical risks, rather than just stating them. Or what trade-offs exist between transportation methods. Yeah, that should do it."
