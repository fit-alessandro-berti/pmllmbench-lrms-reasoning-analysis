The model defines various constraints like existence, absence, exactly_one, etc. and for each constraint, it specifies an activity along with support, confidence, and sometimes a target activity. Lets break down the constraints: 1. existence: Receive_Application and Gather_Additional_Documents must occur at least once. 2. absence: Proceed_Without_Compliance must never occur. 3. exactly_one: Preliminary_Credit_Check must occur exactly once. 4. init: Receive_Application is the starting activity."
