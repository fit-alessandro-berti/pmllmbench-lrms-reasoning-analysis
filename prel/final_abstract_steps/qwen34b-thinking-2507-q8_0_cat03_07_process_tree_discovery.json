Starting with Case 1: RA -> VF -> AE -> RMI -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC. So after RMI, it goes back to VF, then AD, SC, AC. Case 2 is similar: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC. No RMI here. Case 3 has RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC. So two RMI activities followed by VF again."

The RMI can happen multiple times (like in Case 3, two RMIs), and each time after RMI, they re-validate the form (VF) before proceeding to approval."
