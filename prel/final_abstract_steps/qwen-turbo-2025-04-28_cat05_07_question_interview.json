The goal is to clarify and improve understanding, so I need to make sure the questions cover all the areas mentioned: missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, exceptions, etc."

The process starts with the landlord contacting the regional office. Then theres documentation review, recording details, assigning a property manager, introductory meetings, scheduling photographer and inspector, handling inspection issues, marketing, tenant screening, activation, quality checks, and audits."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So, for each of these steps, I can think of possible questions. Let me start with the documentation review. The interviewee mentioned that if documents are missing or outdated, they request updates. But what if the landlord cant provide them? How does that affect the process? Maybe a question about handling incomplete documentation."
