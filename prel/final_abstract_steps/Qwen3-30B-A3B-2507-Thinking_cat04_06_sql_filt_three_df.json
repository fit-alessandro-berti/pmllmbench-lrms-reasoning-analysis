So, the task is to write a DuckDB SQL query that returns all events from the event_log table except those cases that have a specific sequence of activities with a time condition. Let me break down what's needed. First, the key points from the prompt: 1. We need to find cases (case_id) that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' → 'Create Order' → 'Confirm Order' in direct succession (no other events between them). 2. Among those cases, we only want to exclude the ones where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. 3. Then, return all events except those from the excluded cases."

So, cases that have the sequence with the time >5 days are excluded. So the final result should be all events not in those cases. Wait, let's clarify: - Identify cases that have the exact sequence (Approve → Create → Confirm) in order, no other events between. - Among those cases, further filter to only those where (Confirm Order timestamp - Create Order timestamp) > 5 days. - Then, exclude those cases. So the final result should be all events from cases that are NOT in this excluded set."

Then, select all events from event_log where case_id is NOT in that list. But how to find the cases with the sequence? To find the sequence, since it's direct succession, for a given case_id, the events must be ordered by timestamp, and the three activities must appear consecutively. So for a case_id, we need to check that there's an event with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', followed immediately by 'Confirm Order'."

Wait, but the sequence is three in a row. So for the 'Approve' event, the next event should be 'Create', and the one after that should be 'Confirm'. So, for each row (event) in the event_log, ordered by timestamp per case_id: - If activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then check if the next activity (lead activity) is 'Create Order', and the one after that (lead lead) is 'Confirm Order'."

Step 2: For those case_ids, find the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events (i.e., the timestamp of 'Confirm Order' minus timestamp of 'Create Order').

So, for the 'Create Order' event, the next event (in the sequence) is 'Confirm Order', so the timestamp difference would be between the 'Create Order' timestamp and the next event's timestamp (which is 'Confirm Order').

In DuckDB, the difference between two timestamps can be calculated using subtraction, and then compared to an interval. So, (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY.

So this case should be excluded. In the inner query, for the row with activity 'Approve', the next_activity is 'Create', next_next_activity is 'Confirm', and confirm_ts - create_ts = 6 days >5, so case_id is selected for exclusion. Thus, the final query would exclude this case. Another example: if the sequence is Approve → Create → Confirm, but the time between Create and Confirm is 4 days, then this case is not excluded, so it remains in the result."

So, the query should exclude all events from the case_id that are in the inner query. Therefore, the final query is as above. But let's check if the LEAD functions are correctly applied. In the sequence_events CTE, for each row, we get the next activity and the next next activity. For the row where activity is 'Approve', the next_activity should be 'Create', and next_next_activity 'Confirm'. Then, the create_ts is the timestamp of the next row (which is 'Create'), and confirm_ts is the timestamp of the row after that (which is 'Confirm'). So, the time between Create and Confirm is confirm_ts - create_ts, which is correct. Yes. Another edge case: if a case has multiple sequences, but we're using DISTINCT case_id, so even if a case has multiple occurrences of the sequence, it's only counted once. The problem says any case that contains the following sequence, so even one occurrence is enough to exclude the entire case. So, using DISTINCT case_id is correct."

For example, if a case has 'Approve', 'Create', 'Confirm' but with other activities in between, then the next_activity would not be 'Create' for the 'Approve' row, so it won't be selected. Thus, the query correctly filters only the direct succession. Another point: the problem says three activities in direct succession: Approve, Create, Confirm. So, the three events must be consecutive. So, no other events between them. Which is exactly what the LEAD functions check. Yes. Therefore, the query should be correct."
