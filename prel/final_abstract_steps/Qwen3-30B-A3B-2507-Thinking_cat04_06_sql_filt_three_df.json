We need to find cases (case_id) that have the sequence: 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' in direct succession (no other events between them). 2. Among those cases, we only want to exclude the ones where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. 3. Then, return all events except those from the excluded cases."

    "Text": "But how to find the cases with the sequence? To find the sequence, since it's direct succession, for a given case_id, the events must be ordered by timestamp, and the three activities must appear consecutively. So for a case_id, we need to check that there's an event with activity 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', followed immediately by 'Confirm Order'. So, in SQL terms, for each case_id, we can order the events by timestamp, and then check for the sequence. One way to do this is to use window functions to get the next activity for each row"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Therefore, to find the case_ids where the time between Create and Confirm is more than 5 days, we need to ensure that the Create is immediately followed by Confirm (so the next event after Create is Confirm), and also that the event before Create is Approve. But in the inner query, if we check that activity = 'Create Order' and next activity = 'Confirm Order', that ensures that Create is followed by Confirm. But to ensure that Approve is followed by Create, we need to check that the event before Create is Approve. So, perhaps the correct approach is to first find the case_ids that have the exact sequence, then for those, check the time between Create and Confirm."

Another thing: the time difference. In DuckDB, the difference between two timestamps can be calculated using subtraction, and then compared to an interval. So, (confirm_ts - create_ts) > INTERVAL '5' DAY. But let's confirm: in DuckDB, the interval is specified with '5' DAY, so that's correct."
