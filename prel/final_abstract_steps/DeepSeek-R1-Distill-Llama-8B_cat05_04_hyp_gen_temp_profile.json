The claims table has information about each claim, like the amount, type, and submission date. The adjusters table includes details about each adjuster, their specialization, and region. The claim_events table tracks the progression of each claim through various activities, each with a timestamp, resource, and additional info."

For P to N being too long, perhaps there's a backlog or resource issues. A to C being quick suggests some claims are closed too soon, maybe without proper evaluation. E to N being too fast might mean steps are skipped or done automatically."

    "Text": "Let me outline the steps: 1. Identify Anomalies: Review each activity pair's average time and STDEV. Determine which ones deviate significantly from expected norms. 2. Generate Hypotheses: For each anomaly, think about possible causes. For example, if R to P is too short, maybe the approval is happening too quickly without proper evaluation. 3. Propose SQL Queries: Write queries to fetch data that highlights these anomalies, possibly filtering by specific adjusters, claim types, or regions to see if the issues are concentrated."
