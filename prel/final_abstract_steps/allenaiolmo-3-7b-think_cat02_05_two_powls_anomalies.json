    "Text": "In Model 1 the process could go Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard which is correct But it could also go Post Screen Decide Onboard skipping the interview In Model 2 the process could go Post Interview Decide wrong or Post Screen Interview Decide correct So both models have issues with the order between Screen and the other steps"

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Model 2 has additional severe issues beyond the order problem the loop onboarding Thats a controlflow anomaly where onboarding can loop indefinitely Thats a severe problem because it could lead to an infinite loop making the process nonterminating which is a critical failure The XOR allowing to skip payroll is also bad Model 1 doesnt have such controlflow anomalies its purely a sequence issue Therefore even though both models have serious flaws Model 2 has more severe anomalies loop and possible infinite loop and skipping payroll in addition to the order issue Thus Model 1 is closer to the normative because its deviations are mainly about the order of steps whereas Model 2 introduces controlflow anomalies that are more severe"
