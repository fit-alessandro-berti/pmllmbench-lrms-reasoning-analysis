Why air freight sometimes? 5. Who talks to suppliers? 6. Is 24/7 assembly good? 7. What about customs delays? 8. How do we know demand? 9. What if quality fails often? 10. Can we make it greener? ... (Need to make them more open-ended and thought-provoking) * *Attempt 2 (Refining for Depth):* 1. What strategic factors dictated the choice of Malaysia for assembly over other potential locations? ... 10. How is sales forecast accuracy measured and how does it influence supplier orders? ... (Need 10 more) * *Attempt 3 (Expanding to 20 and ensuring variety):* 11. In the event of a natural disaster affecting one component source, how does the process dynamically reroute sourcing? ... 20. What technological integrations could reduce the latency between Quality Checks and Assembly adjustments?"

What strategic advantages does assembling in Malaysia offer compared to other potential locations, considering the diverse origins of the components? ... 20.
