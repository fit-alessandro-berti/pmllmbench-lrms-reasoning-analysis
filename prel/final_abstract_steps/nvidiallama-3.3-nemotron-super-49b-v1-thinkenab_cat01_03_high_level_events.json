    "Text": "Looking at the sample events for case A1 and B2, I see a repeating pattern. Let's go through each sequence. Starting with A1: The first few events are Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place on table, Align, and Preheat. These all seem related to getting the material ready."

    "Text": "Next, the events switch to Operator B picking up a welding tool and then welding two corners. Then there's a measurement by Quality Sensor #1. Welding is part of assembly, and the measurement is a check. But wait, the measurement comes right after welding, so maybe that's part of the welding process's quality check."

    "Text": "So grouping: Material Prep (retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat), then Welding (pickup tool, weld A, weld B), then Quality Check (measure integrity), then Coating (apply coating, dry), then Final Check (visual check). But wait, the coating steps are distinct. Also, the measuring weld integrity might be part of the assembly's quality assurance."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, looking at case A1, after welding corners, the next event is Measure weld integrity. That seems like a check on the welding. So perhaps Welding includes the actual welding actions, and then the measurement is a separate quality step. But the problem suggests grouping into higher-level steps. Looking at B2's events to confirm. Yes, same sequence."

    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Alternatively, the high-level steps could be: 1. Material Preparation (Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat) 2. Assembly (Pick up tool, Weld A, Weld B) 3. Quality Inspection (Measure Integrity, Visual Check) 4. Coating Application (Apply, Dry) But in the sample, after welding, the measure integrity comes immediately, then coating. So maybe the Quality Inspection includes both the sensor check and the visual check?"

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Another approach is to look for natural breaks in the sequence. After preheating, the next action is picking up the welding tool. That's a clear transition from preparation to assembly. Then after welding, measuring integrity is a check. Then coating steps, then a final check. Looking at the timestamps, after welding (A1 08:01:10 and 08:01:20), then measure at 08:01:20, coating at 08:01:30, dry at 08:01:45, then visual check at 08:02:00."

Coating Process (apply and dry) 4. Final Inspection But the measurement is done right after welding, so maybe it's part of the welding step's quality control. However, the resource is different (Quality Sensor), which might indicate a separate step."
