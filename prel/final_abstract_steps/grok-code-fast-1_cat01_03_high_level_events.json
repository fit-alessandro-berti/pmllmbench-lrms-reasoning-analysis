    "Text": "Case A1 sequence includes retrieving raw metal, scanning barcode, placing on table, aligning with Robot Arm #2, and preheating. The steps involve Operator A, Robot Arm #2, and Heating Unit #1, focusing on initial setup. Similar steps are noted for case B2, indicating a consistent preparation phase."
