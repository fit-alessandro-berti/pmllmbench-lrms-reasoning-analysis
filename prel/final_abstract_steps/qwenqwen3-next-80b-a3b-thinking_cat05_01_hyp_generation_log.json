Thats definitely out of order. For example, Confirm Shipment (step 4) happens before Credit Check (step 2) and Validate Stock (step 3). Thats a problem because you cant confirm shipment before checking credit and validating stock. Also, Ship Goods (step 5) happens before Credit Check and Validate Stock. Thats a major anomaly."

Thats out of order. Normally, you confirm shipment before shipping goods. So in this case, they shipped goods (step 5) before confirming shipment (step 4). Thats an anomaly. Also, Validate Stock (step 3) is missing entirely here. Let me check the data again. For 1003: 15: Register Order 16: Perform Credit Check 17: Ship Goods 18: Issue Invoice 19: Confirm Shipment 20: Receive Payment Yes, so after performing credit check, they ship goods directly, then issue invoice, then confirm shipment. Confirming shipment after shipping goods doesnt make sense. Usually, you confirm shipment first (schedule it), then ship. So thats a problem. Also, Validate Stock is missing. So Validate Stock (step 3) is not present here."

Normally, you issue invoice after shipping, then receive payment. But here, payment is received before invoice is issued. Also, Confirm Shipment happens after Receive Payment and before Ship Goods. But usually, you confirm shipment (schedule it), then ship. So here, confirm shipment is after receiving payment, which doesnt make sense. Also, ship goods after confirming shipment, but the payment was already received before issuing invoice. Thats a big problem."

    "Text": "So possible anomalies: For case 1002:  - Confirm Shipment before Credit Check and Validate Stock  - Ship Goods before Credit Check and Validate Stock For case 1003: - Ship Goods before Validate Stock (which is missing) and before Confirm Shipment  - Confirm Shipment after Ship Goods For case 1004: - Receive Payment before Issue Invoice  - Confirm Shipment after Receive Payment  - Ship Goods after Confirm Shipment but all steps are out of order Also, looking at the order of events in each case. Lets check if any steps are missing. For example, in case 1003, Validate Stock is missing. So step 3 is not present. Similarly, for 1004, Validate Stock is missing. Lets check the data again. Case 1004 events: Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods. So steps 1,7,6,4,5. Missing steps 2 (Credit Check), 3 (Validate Stock). So thats a problem. Case 1002: events include Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock, but they happen after Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods. So steps 2 and 3 are present but out of order. Now, possible anomalies: 1. Activity order violations: steps happening out of sequence. 2. Missing steps: e.g., Validate Stock not present in some cases. 3. Inconsistent timing: e.g., payment received before invoice issued."

    "Text": "Possible hypotheses for anomalies: - System errors: maybe automated processes triggering events out of order due to bugs. - Policy violations: someone manually overriding the process. - Training issues: staff not following the correct procedures. - Data entry errors: wrong timestamps or activity names recorded. - Workflow automation issues: e.g., some steps being skipped in the system. For example, in case 1004: receiving payment before issuing invoice. Thats impossible unless theres a prepayment or something, but according to the normal process, invoice comes before payment. Unless theres a special case, but the problem statement says Assumed Normal Process Flow, so deviations are anomalies. Another point: Confirm Shipment usually happens before Ship Goods. In case 1003, they ship first then confirm. Maybe a mistake in the system where Confirm Shipment is recorded after the actual shipment. Or maybe the system is logging events in wrong order. Also, Validate Stock missing in some cases. For example, case 1003 and 1004. If Validate Stock is required, then missing that step could be a problem. Lets check for case 1002: Perform Credit Check happens after Ship Goods. Credit Check should be before shipping, because if credit is not approved, the order shouldnt proceed. So if they ship before credit check, thats a risk. Similarly, for case 1004, receiving payment before invoice is issued. Thats impossible because you cant receive payment for an invoice that hasnt been issued."

    "Text": "Normal order: 1. Register Order (seq 1) 2. Perform Credit Check (seq 2) 3. Validate Stock (seq 3) 4. Confirm Shipment (seq 4) 5. Ship Goods (seq 5) 6. Issue Invoice (seq 6) 7. Receive Payment (seq 7) Then, for each case, for each activity, we can get its sequence number, and then check if the sequence numbers are increasing. If not, then theres an anomaly. So for each case_id, group by case_id, order by timestamp, and then check if the sequence numbers of activities are non-decreasing. If any activity has a lower sequence number than the previous one, thats a problem. So to find cases where the sequence is out of order. But how to do that in SQL. First, create a mapping of activity to sequence: activity | seq Register Order | 1 Perform Credit Check | 2 Validate Stock |3 Confirm Shipment |4 Ship Goods |5 Issue Invoice |6 Receive Payment |7 Then, for each case, order by timestamp, and check if the seq is increasing. So using a window function to get the previous activitys seq, and compare. For example: WITH activity_seq AS (     SELECT          case_id,         activity,         timestamp,         CASE activity             WHEN Register Order THEN 1             WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2             WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3             WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4             WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5             WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6             WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7         END AS seq     FROM order_event_log ), ordered_events AS (     SELECT          case_id,         activity,         timestamp,         seq,         LAG(seq) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_seq     FROM activity_seq ) SELECT      case_id,     activity,     timestamp,     seq,     prev_seq FROM ordered_events WHERE seq < prev_seq; This would show all events where the current activitys sequence is less than the previous one, indicating an out-of-order event."

So select case_id from order_event_log where activity = Validate Stock and then exclude those case_ids, but maybe better to check for cases that dont have Validate Stock. SELECT case_id FROM order_event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(CASE WHEN activity = Validate Stock THEN 1 END) = 0; Similarly for other steps. Also, check for cases where Perform Credit Check is missing. Another anomaly: for example, in case 1004, Receive Payment happens right after Register Order. But Receive Payment is step 7, which should happen after all other steps. So thats a critical issue."

Hypothesize reasons. 3. Provide SQL queries to investigate. Lets list each anomaly with examples. Anomaly 1: Activity sequence violations. Examples: - In case 1002, Confirm Shipment (step4) occurs before Perform Credit Check (step2) and Validate Stock (step3). This violates the normal process flow where credit check and stock validation must happen before confirming shipment. - In case 1003, Ship Goods (step5) occurs before Confirm Shipment (step4), which is illogical since you cant ship goods before confirming shipment. - In case 1004, Receive Payment (step7) occurs before Issue Invoice (step6), which is impossible as payment cannot be received before an invoice is issued. Anomaly 2: Missing critical steps. - Case 1003 and 1004 are missing Validate Stock activity, which is required before shipping goods. - Case 1004 is missing Perform Credit Check activity. Anomaly 3: Resource-related issues (though not evident in the given data, but possible). For example, if a Finance activity is performed by a non-Finance resource."
