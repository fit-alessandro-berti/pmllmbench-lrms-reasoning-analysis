Retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating. These all seem part of preparing the material before actual assembly."

The first four or five steps are all about getting the material ready for the main operations. So maybe \"Material Preparation and Preheating\" as a step? Or split into preparation and preheating?\n\nAlternatively, \"Material Preparation\" could include retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating. Then moving on to welding steps."

This is a check after welding. \n\n4. **Coating Application and Drying**:\n   - Apply coating, dry. \n\n5. **Final Visual Inspection**:\n   - The visual check at the end."

    "Text": "Wait, but the problem mentions grouping events that are temporally close, same resources, or logical sequence. Let me check the timestamps. The preheat is at 08:00:20, then the next event after a short gap is picking up the tool at 08:01:00. So there's a minute between preheating and starting welding. But that's still part of the same phase? Probably yes, since the preheating is part of preparing the material for welding."

    "Text": "Hmm, but maybe \"Quality Inspection\" could include both the weld check and the visual check? Or are they separate? The weld check is specific to the welds, while the final visual is a broader check. Looking at the sample, the visual check is after coating and drying, so it's the final step. So the high-level steps would be:\n\n1. Material Preparation and Preheating\n   - Includes retrieving, scanning (maybe part of getting the correct material), placing on table, aligning, and preheating. \n\n2. Welding Assembly\n   - Picking up the tool and performing the welds.\n\n3. Weld Quality Check\n   - The measurement by the sensor. \n\n4. Coating Application and Drying\n   - Applying coating and drying. \n\n5. Final Visual Inspection\n   - The final check by an operator."

The scanning could be part of ensuring the correct part is used. The welding steps are clearly part of assembly. The quality check after welding makes sense as a separate step. Coating and drying are part of a coating process phase. The final visual check is the final inspection before completion."

Maybe combining the weld check and final check under a broader \"Quality Assurance\" but they are at different stages. Since the weld check is after welding, and the visual is at the end, they are separate steps. Alternatively, maybe \"Post-Weld Quality Check\" and \"Final Visual Inspection\". Alternatively, grouping all quality checks into one step might not be right, since they are at different stages. So keeping them separate is better."
