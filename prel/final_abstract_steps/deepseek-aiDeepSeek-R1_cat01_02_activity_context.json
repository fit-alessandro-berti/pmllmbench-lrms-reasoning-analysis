    "Text": "First, I need to look through each case and identify which activities occur multiple times. Lets start by scanning the logs. Looking at Case C001: - Initiate Request (once) - Verify Documents (twice) - Call Customer (once) - Submit Additional (once) - Approve Request (once) So Verify Documents is repeated here. The first Verify Documents is when the agent checks identity docs, but then after the customer submits additional info, they Verify Documents again. The context here is different: initial check vs. re-check after getting missing documents. In Case C002: - Verify Documents once, then Adjust Account, then another Call Customer, but Verify doesnt repeat here. Wait, no. C002 has Verify Documents once. Wait, looking again at C002s activities: Initiate, Verify, Call, Adjust, Call, Approve. So the repeated activity here is Call Customer happening twice. The first call is to clarify an account discrepancy, the second is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. So the same activity name but different purposes. Case C003: Verify Documents occurs twice. First is physical verification, then after account adjustment, another verification. Also, Call Customer once (but maybe different from others?), and Adjust Account once. So Verify repeats here as well. So the recurring activities across cases are: - Verify Documents (occurs multiple times in C001 and C003) - Call Customer (occurs twice in C002 and once in others, but in C002 twice) - Adjust Account is only in C002 and C003 once each, but maybe not repeated in same case. Wait, C002 has Adjust once. So maybe in C002, Call Customer is the one that repeats. So the main activities to focus on are Verify Documents and Call Customer, which repeat within the same case with different contexts."

    "Text": "Starting with Verify Documents in C001: First occurrence: Agent checks identity documents. The context is initial verification. The second Verify Documents in C001 is after the customer submits additional info, so its a re-check. So we can rename the first to Initial Document Verification and the second to Recheck Documents After Submission or something similar. In C003, the first Verify is physical verification at the branch, then after Adjust Account, they re-verify. So here, the first is in-person, maybe In-Person Document Verification and the second could be Post-Adjustment Document Recheck. Then in Call Customer in C002: first call is to clarify discrepancy, the second is follow-up confirmation. So first could be Clarification Call and the second Follow-Up Confirmation Call. For C001s Call Customer, the context is requesting missing docs. So Request Missing Documents Call. C003s Call Customer is when the customer stepped out, so the officer calls them to return. Maybe Callback to Return to Branch."

    "Text": "Another activity to check is Adjust Account. In C002, Adjust Account is after a call to clarify discrepancy, and in C003 its due to missing info. But Adjust Account occurs once per case, so maybe no need to rename unless same name is used for different contexts across cases, but the problem says focus on same case. So maybe not an issue here. Wait, let me make sure all recurring within the same case are covered. C001: Verify Documents x2 C002: Call Customer x2 C003: Verify Documents x2 Thats all the repeats. So those are the activities to rename. Now, for each instance, we need to create a distinct name based on context. For Verify Documents in C001: First: Checking initial submission. Maybe Initial Document Check Second: After customer uploads missing ID, so Additional Documents Verification In C003s first Verify: Physical at branch, In-Person Document Verification Second Verify: After account adjustment, so Post-Adjustment Document Verification For Calls in C002: First call: Clarify account discrepancy. Clarification Call Second call: Confirm adjustments. Adjustment Confirmation Call In C001s Call: Request missing docs. Missing Documents Request Call In C003s Call: Customer stepped out, so Customer Recall Call So now, renaming these activities accordingly. Also, maybe look at the Adjust Account in C002 and C003. But they are in different cases. The problem is only concerned with same-case duplicates. Since they dont repeat within the same case, maybe not necessary to change unless theres ambiguity. But the problem says activities that appear multiple times within a single case. So Adjust Account only occurs once per case, so no. Similarly, other activities. So the key ones are Verify Documents and Call Customer in specific cases."

    "Text": "Now, compiling the revised event log. For each case, replace the activity names based on context. Starting with C001: Original Activities: 1. Initiate Request 2. Verify Documents (Initial check) 3. Call Customer (missing docs) 4. Submit Additional 5. Verify Documents (recheck) 6. Approve Request Renamed: Verify Documents 1  Initial Document Verification Call Customer  Request Missing Documents Call Verify Documents 2  Additional Documents Verification C002 Activities: 1. Initiate 2. Verify Documents (no repeat) 3. Call Customer (clarify) 4. Adjust Account 5. Call Customer (follow-up) 6. Approve Renamed: Call Customer 1  Clarification Call Call Customer 2  Adjustment Confirmation Call C003 Activities: 1. Initiate 2. Verify Documents (physical) 3. Call Customer (recall) 4. Adjust Account 5. Verify Documents (post-adjust) 6. Approve Renamed: Verify Documents 1  In-Person Document Verification Call Customer  Customer Recall Call Verify Documents 2  Post-Adjustment Document Verification Now, justification: - For Verify Documents in C001, the first is initial check, second after additional docs. Renamed to highlight initial vs. additional. - For C002s calls, the first is to clarify discrepancy, second is confirmation, so different purposes. - In C003, first Verify is physical (branch officer), second is after account adjustment, hence renaming to in-person and post-adjustment. Additional Context clues: The Additional Context column gives info. For example, in C001s second Verify Documents, context mentions re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided. So Additional Documents Verification makes sense. Similarly, C003s first Verify: Physical verification of ID at branch. Second Verify: Re-verify docs after account adjustment. So these contextual clues are key in renaming. So the revised table would replace the activity names accordingly. Let me make sure all instances are covered. Yes. So the final answer is the revised log with these new activity names and a brief justification."
