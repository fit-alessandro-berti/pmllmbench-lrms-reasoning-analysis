The instruction is to Identify the anomalies in the temporal profile model, generate hypotheses on why these anomalies might exist and Propose verification approaches using SQL queries. The answer should be provided as text that contains: - Anomalies identified: list the suspicious activities. They are: - R->P (Receive to Approve) has average time ~25 hours with a very low standard deviation, indicating a rigid schedule. - P->N (Approve to Notify) has an extremely long average delay of 7 days, high variability. - A->C (Assign to Close) has a relatively quick closure (2 hours average), which might indicate premature closure without evaluation/approval steps. - E->N (Evaluate to Notify): only 5 minutes on average, which is suspiciously fast."

    "Text": "- Provide SQL queries: For example query: identify claims where the difference in timestamps between R and A is abnormal. But note we need to generate queries that check each anomaly. We can propose some SQL queries using PostgreSQL functions like EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM timestamp difference). Well propose separate queries for anomalies, e.g.,: 1) Query to find claims with unusually long delay between P (Approve) and N (Notify): SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MINUTE(timestamp - lag_timestamp)) etc. But we need a query that calculates the time differences between events for each claim. For that we can use window functions partitioned by claim_id ordered by timestamp. We want to find anomalies where times fall outside expected ranges, e.g., for R->P: average 25 hours Â± threshold maybe standard deviation factor. We could propose queries like: SELECT claim_id, activity, (timestamp - lag(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id ORDER BY timestamp)) as time_diff FROM claim_events; But then we can filter on specific pairs of events. But for each pair, e.g., R->P, P->N etc. We could propose a query for the R->A anomaly: SELECT c.claim_id, (a.timestamp - r.timestamp) as time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events r JOIN claim_events a ON r.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = P WHERE r.activity = R AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (a.timestamp - r.timestamp)) NOT BETWEEN 3600-600 AND 3600+600; But need to check exactly, the original model said: R->A is average 1 hour (3600 seconds) with stdev 10 minutes => but no anomaly is mentioned for R->A. Its not flagged as anomalous in the description. We have anomalies: - For R->P: average 90000 seconds (approx. 25 hours) low std dev. Query could be: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events p, claim_events r WHERE p.claim_id = r.claim_id AND p.activity=P and r.activity=R AND ABS(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) - 90000) > some threshold maybe? But how to incorporate standard deviation? We can propose a query that returns claims with time difference outside expected range: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) as diff_seconds FROM claim_events p JOIN claim_events r ON p.claim_id = r.claim_id and r.activity=R WHERE p.activity=P AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) < 90000 - some threshold OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) > 90000 + some threshold); But we can also propose a query for P->N anomaly: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) as diff_seconds FROM claim_events n JOIN claim_events p ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id and p.activity=P WHERE n.activity=N AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) < 604800 - 172800 OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800 + 172800); For A->C anomaly: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) as diff_seconds FROM claim_events c JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id and a.activity=A WHERE c.activity=C AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200 OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) > some threshold? But the average is 2 hours but with high deviation, so we need to check if its too quick maybe less than a threshold like 3600 seconds. The anomaly described: Assign to Close is only 2 hours on average, which might suggest premature closure. But wait, re-read the description of anomaly for A->C: - It says: A to C (Assign to Close): Having a relatively quick closure (2 hours on average) after assign, without seeing steps like Evaluate or Approve consistently in between, might suggest some claims are prematurely closed. So anomaly is not necessarily about being too short or long but that it bypasses intermediate steps. But if the average is 7200 seconds then its normal. But its flagged as suspicious because it may indicate skipping required steps. So maybe we can propose a query to detect claims where events E or P are missing entirely after assign event and before close: SELECT claim_id FROM ( SELECT claim_id, MAX(CASE WHEN activity = E THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_evaluate, MAX(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as has_approve FROM claim_events WHERE activity IN (A, E,P) GROUP BY claim_id ) sub WHERE (has_evaluate = 0 AND has_approve = 0); But the anomaly description said: Having a relatively quick closure after assign, without seeing steps like Evaluate or Approve consistently in between. So we need to look for claims that have a closing event (C) shortly after assignment (A) but no evaluation (E) and approval (P). But if A->C is flagged as suspicious because it might be skipping steps. So a query: SELECT claim_id FROM claim_events WHERE activity = C AND EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e2 WHERE e2.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id and e2.activity=A and claim_events.timestamp - e2.timestamp < interval 3 hours ) AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 from claim_events e3 where e3.claim_id = claim_events.claim_id and e3.activity in (E,P) ); But I need to propose a query that checks if between A and C, the time is below a threshold indicating closure without intermediate steps. The expected average for A->C is 7200 seconds (2 hours) but if its too quick maybe less than a threshold, say less than 3600 seconds then we can suspect anomaly. But our text said relatively quick closure meaning average of 2 hours is already considered suspicious because the process should include intermediate steps. However, Ill propose to detect claims that have an immediate transition from A to C with no other events in between. - For E->N anomaly: only 5 minutes on average, which might indicate skipping required checks after evaluation before notifying. So a query: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) as diff_seconds FROM claim_events n JOIN claim_events e ON n.claim_id = e.claim_id and e.activity=E WHERE n.activity=N AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300; -- threshold maybe 300 seconds We could propose queries that filter events that are outside the expected ranges."

    "Text": "I can generate a summary in plain text listing anomalies, possible reasons and sample SQL queries. Ill produce a final answer with clear structure: first list anomalies, then list hypotheses (with bullet points) then provide sample queries for each anomaly detection. I need to note that some of the queries might use window functions or join self on claim_events table. The answer should not reference instructions or explanation text. It must present independently the anomalies, possible reasons and verification queries. Lets produce an answer in plain text with bullet points. Ill produce a final answer as follows: Title: Anomalies Identification 1. R to P (Receive to Approve) anomaly: - Anomaly: Average time is around 25 hours with very low standard deviation. - Hypothesis: This may indicate that approvals are scheduled at fixed intervals or processed automatically in batch, masking underlying delays. 2. P to N (Approve to Notify) anomaly: - Anomaly: The average delay is about 7 days with a high standard deviation of 2 days. - Hypothesis: There might be inconsistent processing times due to manual intervention or resource constraints causing notifications to sometimes occur immediately after approval and other times be delayed. 3. A to C (Assign to Close) anomaly: - Anomaly: Claims close on average within 2 hours of assignment, potentially bypassing necessary evaluation or approval steps. - Hypothesis: Some claims might be closed prematurely due to automated triggers or misrouting, possibly skipping required checks. 4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify) anomaly: - Anomaly: Only an average of 5 minutes between evaluate and notify events. - Hypothesis: The rapid transition could suggest that notifications are generated automatically right after evaluation, possibly without adequate review or follow-up steps. Verification Approaches using SQL Queries: For R->P anomaly: Query to find claims with approval times outside the expected range (e.g., if we assume a threshold Â± STDEV): -- Query example: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events p JOIN claim_events r ON p.claim_id = r.claim_id AND r.activity = R WHERE p.activity = P AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) < 90000 - 3600 OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.timestamp - r.timestamp)) > 90000 + 3600); For P->N anomaly: Query to detect claims with notification delays outside expected bounds: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events n JOIN claim_events p ON n.claim_id = p.claim_id AND p.activity = P WHERE n.activity = N AND (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) < 604800 - 172800 OR EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - p.timestamp)) > 604800 + 172800); For A->C anomaly: Query to identify claims that have a closing event soon after assignment, without intermediate evaluation or approval events: SELECT c.claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events c JOIN claim_events a ON c.claim_id = a.claim_id AND a.activity = A WHERE c.activity = C AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (c.timestamp - a.timestamp)) < 7200 AND NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM claim_events e WHERE e.claim_id = c.claim_id AND e.activity IN (E, P) ); For E->N anomaly: Query to identify claims with rapid notification following evaluation: SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) AS time_diff_seconds FROM claim_events n JOIN claim_events e ON n.claim_id = e.claim_id AND e.activity = E WHERE n.activity = N AND EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n.timestamp - e.timestamp)) < 300; I can produce the answer accordingly.
