  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the answer would be that the bias is introduced in step 3 where the system gives a score boost to applicants who are local or part of certain community groups This is a form of bias because its using a non protected characteristic to influence the loan approval The company might argue that its justifiable as a way to reward community engagement but this could be problematic because it creates an unfair advantage for certain groups and may lead to discrimination against others The implications are that the process is not entirely fair as its using factors that are not directly related to creditworthiness but are instead based on social or geographic factors This could lead to unequal treatment and undermine the principle of fairness in lending"
