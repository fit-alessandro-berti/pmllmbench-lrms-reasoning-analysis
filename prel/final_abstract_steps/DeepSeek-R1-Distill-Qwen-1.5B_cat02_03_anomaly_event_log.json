The case ID 1001 has activities that go from creating the purchase requisition, then Approving it, Issue the order, receive goods, receive the invoice, match the invoice to the order, close the case. That makes sense."

The first activity is Create Purchase Requisition, then Approve Purchase Requisition, Issue Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice to PO, and Close Case. Wait, after receiving goods, the next step is Issue Purchase Order. That's a bit odd. Usually, after receiving goods, you should probably send the order. The standard process would be to issue the order after receiving goods, but here, the order is already issued before receiving goods. That's a bit out of sequence."

Is that a normal part of the process? Probably not, because each case is an independent process instance. That seems like an anomaly, but perhaps not necessarily an error. Maybe the system resets or starts a new case."

In Case 1003, the order activity happens before the invoice is received, which is backward. 3. The fact that 1003 is repeated without a reason might be an error, but it's unusual, so maybe it's a user error."
