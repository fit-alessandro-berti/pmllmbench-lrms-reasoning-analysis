    "Text": "Looking at the examples: In Case 1, the sequence is OR MS QS AS IQC AS TST RT TST PK LB DP D. So after TST fails, RT is done and then TST again. IQC happened once here, but in other cases, it can repeat. For example, in Case 3, there are multiple IQC and AS steps. Also, RT leads back to TST. In Case 2, LB is skipped. So theres an option to skip LB. In Case 4, theres no IQC or RT, which suggests that those steps might be optional. Case 5 has multiple RT and TST steps, indicating possible loops in testing phase."

    "Text": "The loop here is that after TST, you might have RT followed by TST again. So this seems like a loop where after TST, you can choose to exit (if test passed) or do RT and loop back to TST. Wait, but RT is an activity that indicates the product failed and needs to be retested. So the loop between TST and RT would be modeled as a loop where A is TST and B is RT. Because the loop is *(A,B) = execute A, then either exit or B followed by A again."

    "Text": "Alternative Idea: The IQC is followed by a choice: redo AS or continue. But AS could be followed by another IQC. Alternatively, after AS: A partial order where IQC can be done multiple times (concurrently?), but this doesnt fit. Perhaps I should look for patterns in the data: Case 3: After initial AS: IQC (1015), IQC (1030), then AS (1045), then IQC (1100), then AS (1115), then TST. So: IQC, IQC, AS, IQC, AS. This suggests that after AS, theres a loop that allows multiple IQCs (loop on IQC itself), then you must do AS and loop back to the same structure."

Wait, no: IQC_AS_loop is LoopPOWL(A: IQC, B: AS), which requires first IQC. But AS is already before the loop. This doesnt fit."
