Need to define the partial order with the dependencies. But POWL models are built using nodes connected in a partial order. So the main sequence OR must come first, then MS, then QS. These are sequential. QS is followed by the AS and its loop structure. So: OR must be followed by MS (OR MS). MS followed by QS. QS followed by AS_loop structure. Then AS_loop leads to Testing_loop. Testing_loop leads to PK. PK leads to optional LB. LB leads to DP. DP leads to D."

Alternatively: After the initial AS (which is mandatory), there's a loop structure: LoopPOWL*(IQC, AS), which means: Execute IQC, then either exit or execute AS and loop back. But to get to this IQC loop, you must pass through AS first. Not sure. Perhaps the structure after QS is: A choice between: - Proceeding to AS without any loops (unlikely) - Or AS followed by a loop structure on (IQC, AS) This is getting too tangled. Let's try to draft the POWL structure step by step."

Wait, the AS is mandatory, then optionally looping IQC and AS: The sequence would be: QS AS, then optional (IQC followed by AS again). Modeled as AS followed by a loopPOWL(IQC, AS): Loop's A is IQC, B is AS. But the loop starts with IQC. So to reach it, AS must be followed by this loop. So: After AS, LoopPOWL(IQC, AS), which requires executing IQC first. But in Case 4, after AS comes TST. So this would require that the loopPOWL(IQC, AS) is optional. So a choice between loop and proceed. This implies an XOR between the loop and a skip, but POWL doesn't have a direct way to optionalize a loop unless using XOR with a silent."

Wait, no: IQC_AS_loop is LoopPOWL(A: IQC, B: AS), which requires first IQC. But AS is already before the loop. This doesn't fit. Alternative: IQC_AS_Loop is a choice to redo IQC and AS. Or better: The LoopPOWL(A=AS, B=IQC). Execute AS, then choose to exit or do IQC and loop back to AS. After the initial AS, you have Loop(AS, IQC). Which means: Execute AS (A), then exit loop (proceed) or IQC (B) and loop back to AS. This way: Case 1: Loop iteration: Initial AS (A), do B (IQC), loop back to AS (A). But then exit after. So sequence: AS, IQC, AS. Which matches the data. Case 3: After initial AS: Loop: A: AS, B: IQC, loop back to AS again. But in Case 3, after AS comes IQC, IQC, then AS.

So: OR MS, MS QS, QS AS, AS LoopPOWL, LoopPOWL order before TestLoop, and so on. But LoopPOWL allows: Execute IQC (A), exit or AS (B) and loop.
