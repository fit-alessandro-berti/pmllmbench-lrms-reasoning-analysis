    "Text": "Process mining can handle cases that are interrupted, as long as the Case ID remains the same. So if a document is opened, worked on, then closed, and later opened again, is that the same case or a new one? Probably a new case unless there's a clear continuation."

  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Given this ambiguity, perhaps the best approach is to assign the SWITCH event to the case it's transitioning into. Thus, the SWITCH to Chrome is the first event of the Email1 case, and the activity name is something like 'Start Email Task'."
