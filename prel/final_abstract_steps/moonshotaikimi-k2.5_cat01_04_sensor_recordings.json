    "Text": "Alternative interpretation: Events 4-6: Cutting Metal high speed machining Events 7-8: Assembling Parts joining pieces, steady pressure Event 9: Welding the heat spike confirms this Events 11-12: Quality Inspection or Packaging Actually, looking at Event 9 - the temperature jumps to 80C suddenly while tool position stays at 15mm. This is characteristic of welding resistance welding or arc welding. Event 7-8 could be Pressing or Assembling - steady pressure, moderate temperature, low flow."

    "Text": "Wait, I should check if Event 10 is actually part of welding cooling or a separate activity. Given the sharp drop in all metrics, its likely the end of welding and start of coolinginspection. Actually, looking at the pattern: Events 1-3: Idle Events 4-6: Material Processing Cutting Events 7-8: AssemblyClamping Event 9: Welding Event 10: CoolingCleaning Events 11-12: Quality Inspection Events 13-15: IdleReset But Event 11-12 has material flow of 1 unitss and vibration of 5 Hz. This could be Packaging moving to packaging station or Quality Inspection using sensorsvibration for testing."

    "Text": "Let me provide a coherent narrative: 1. Machine IdleStartup Events 1-3: Baseline readings, machine preparing for operation. 2. Cutting Metal Events 4-6: High material flow 5 unitss, tool advancing 510mm, rising temperature friction from cutting, high vibration cutting forces, increasing energy consumption. 3. Part PositioningClamping Events 7-8: Material flow reduced 2 unitss, tool positioned at 15mm holding position, steady pressure, lower vibration holdingstabilizing rather than cutting. 4. Welding Event 9: Extreme temperature spike 80C, maximum vibration 50 Hz - likely from welding arc or resistance welding, no material flow stationary operation, peak energy consumption 5 kWh. The tool stays at 15mm welding position. 5. CoolingTransition Event 10: Rapid temperature drop, minimal vibration, energy reduced - likely cooling period or moving to next station. 6. Quality Inspection Events 11-12: Low but present vibration 5 Hz - possibly from measurement devices or conveyors, low material flow 1 unitss, tool at final position 20mm, moderate energy electronic sensors active. 7. Machine ResetIdle Events 13-15: Return to baseline, process complete."

Rationale summary: Cutting: High flow + tool movement + heat from friction + high vibration Positioning: Steady tool + reduced flow + moderate pressure Welding: Extreme localized heat + high vibration + no flow + max energy Inspection: Low activity + final positioning + sensor energy signature I should present this clearly with the assigned labels and detailed reasoning for each."
