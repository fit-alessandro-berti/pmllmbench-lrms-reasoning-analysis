    "Text": "But how to model this loop part with * operator The LOOP operator allows you to repeat a subtree until an exit occurs via labeled exits So if we have Loop1* = [SC] * Then inside this loop body which is repeated, after executing SC, what is next? But according to point 4, after SC comes treatment choice and RDT again before checking results. So perhaps the entire cycle of SC + treatment + RDT should be part of each iteration of the loop. But how can that fit into a LOOP structure. This seems like a dead end. Maybe I need to look for another approach. Maybe this part is too complex to model in pm4py ProcessTree structure as per given operators."
