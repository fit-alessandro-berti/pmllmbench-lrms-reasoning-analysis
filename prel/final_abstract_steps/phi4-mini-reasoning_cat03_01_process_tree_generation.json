    "Text": "Once the initial diagnostic test is done, the results must be evaluated. If the results are abnormal, a loop commences: The patient must be reviewed by a Specialist Consultation (SC), which could be a cardiologist, hematologist, or another specialist depending on the findings. After consultation, an exclusive treatment choice is made: Administer a Targeted Medication (TM), or Provide a Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT) session. Following the treatment, the patient must undergo a Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT) step."

    "Text": "After normal results are finally achieved, the patient must proceed with a set of advanced diagnostic imaging and lifestyle support activities. These are done to ensure no underlying conditions are missed and to support the patients recovery. The following two activities are done in true concurrency: Advanced Imaging (AI) (e.g., MRI or CT scan), Nutritional Counseling (NC) to optimize patients diet. Both activities should be completed, but their order and concurrency are not fixedâ€”they can be done in parallel."
