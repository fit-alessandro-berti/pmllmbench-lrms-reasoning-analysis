    "Text": "First, the process starts with a Start Event, which is pretty standard. Then it moves to Task A: 'Receive Customer Request'. That makes sense as the initial step where the company gets a request from a customer."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next, there's a Gateway (XOR) labeled 'Check Request Type'. XOR gateways are used for exclusive choices, meaning only one path is taken. So, based on whether the request is Standard or Custom, the process will go down different routes."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If it's a Standard request, it goes to Task B1: 'Perform Standard Validation'. After that, there's a Gateway (AND), which I know is used for parallel processing. So, the process splits into two parallel tasks: Task C1 'Credit Check' and Task C2 'Inventory Check'. These two tasks can happen at the same time, which probably speeds up the process. Once both are done, they converge at the 'All Parallel Checks Completed' join, and then move to Task D: 'Calculate Delivery Date'."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If the request is Custom, it goes to Task B2: 'Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis'. Then there's another XOR Gateway: 'Is Customization Feasible?'. If yes, it goes to Task E1: 'Prepare Custom Quotation'. If no, it goes to Task E2: 'Send Rejection Notice' and ends there. So, for Custom requests, there's an early exit if it's not feasible."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "After both Standard and Custom paths are done, they converge at another XOR Gateway: 'Is Approval Needed?'."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If approval is needed, it goes to Task F: 'Obtain Manager Approval'. Then another XOR Gateway: 'Is Approval Granted?'. If yes, Task G: 'Generate Final Invoice'. If no, Task H: 'Re-evaluate Conditions', which then loops back either to Task E1 (if Custom) or Task D (if Standard). So, if approval isn't granted, the process goes back to either prepare a new quote or recalculate delivery, which makes sense for re-evaluation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If no approval is needed, it directly goes to Task G: 'Generate Final Invoice'. Finally, both paths lead to Task I: 'Send Confirmation to Customer' and then the End Event."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, in the Standard path, after the parallel tasks, it goes to Calculate Delivery Date. Then it joins with the Custom path after either preparing the quote or rejecting. Then it checks if approval is needed. If yes, it goes for approval, which can either lead to invoice or re-evaluation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I need to make sure I explain that the convergence happens after each main path (Standard and Custom) completes their specific tasks. Also, the looping back is only in the case where approval is denied, which sends it back to either E1 or D, depending on the original request type."
