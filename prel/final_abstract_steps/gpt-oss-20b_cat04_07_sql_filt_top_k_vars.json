Construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id, maintaining the order imposed by timestamp. 2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants. 3. Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant). 4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. So we need to produce a single query or multiple queries? Likely one query using CTEs."

In DuckDB, there is group_concat function but not sure about ordering; you can use array_agg with order by and then array_to_string.

Let's confirm syntax: In DuckDB docs, there is function array_agg(expression) returns an ARRAY type aggregated over group; you can specify ORDER BY inside aggregate like array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) works? I think yes because it's similar to Postgres's syntax: array_agg(expression ORDER BY ...). So good."
