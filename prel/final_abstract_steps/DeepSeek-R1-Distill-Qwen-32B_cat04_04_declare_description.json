So, 'Receive_Application' and 'Gather_Additional_Documents' must happen. 'Absence' means an activity must not occur, so 'Proceed_Without_Compliance' is forbidden. 'Exactly_one' means only one instance of an activity can occur, so there's only one 'Preliminary_Credit_Check'."

Wait, no, looking back, 'coexistence' in the model is for 'Gather_Additional_Documents' targeting 'Authorize_Contract_Terms'. So they must occur together? Or one must happen if the other does? I think it's that both must happen; if one occurs, the other must also occur. So after gathering documents, the contract terms must be authorized."

But since it's 'altresponse', does that mean either Transfer_Funds or Notify_Customer can happen? Or that Transfer_Funds must respond to something else? I might be getting confused here. Wait, 'altresponse' means that the activity can be a response to any of the targets, so 'Transfer_Funds' must respond to 'Notify_Customer'? Or is it that 'Transfer_Funds' must be preceded by 'Notify_Customer'? I'm a bit unsure about this one."
