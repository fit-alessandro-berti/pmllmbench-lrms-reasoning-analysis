Wait, the user's model has altprecedence where Notify_Customer is before Transfer_Funds. But altresponse is Transfer_Funds followed by Notify_Customer. So perhaps these are alternative paths? Or maybe there's a mistake. Let me check again. The altprecedence is Notify_Customer target Transfer_Funds, meaning Notify_Customer must precede Transfer_Funds.

So both constraints require that Notify_Customer and Transfer_Funds happen in sequence, but in opposite order. That's a contradiction. How can both be true? Maybe there's a mistake in the model. But since the user says all support and confidence are 1.0, perhaps there's a misunderstanding here. Wait, maybe the altprecedence and altresponse are part of alternative paths. For example, maybe the process can either notify before transfer or after. But the way it's structured here, both are required. That doesn't make sense. Maybe the user made a mistake. But since I have to work with the given model, perhaps I need to resolve this. Alternatively, maybe the constraints are in different contexts.

So perhaps they are done in parallel or in some order? But the model may not specify. Maybe after gathering documents, the authorization is done. Then, the Precedence constraint: Quality_Assurance_Review must come before Authorize_Contract_Terms. Wait, no, the precedence is that Quality_Assurance_Review is before Authorize. So before authorizing, QA review must happen. But if Authorize is step 4, then QA must be step 3.5? That doesn't fit. Wait, the Precedence constraint is Quality_Assurance_Review before Authorize_Contract_Terms. So QA review must come before authorization. But if step 3 is Gather_Additional_Documents, and step 4 is Authorize, then QA review must be before step 4. So perhaps after gathering documents, they do QA review, then authorize.

So maybe Gather and Authorize are done together. But that's conflicting with the Precedence constraint that QA comes before Authorize. So perhaps after gathering, you do QA, then authorize. But how does that fit with the Coexistence? Maybe the Coexistence is not about the order but that both must occur. So if Gather happens, Authorize must happen, and vice versa.
