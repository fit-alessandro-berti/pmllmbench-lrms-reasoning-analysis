But the advantage is that it's a single level query without a subquery in WHERE. But in terms of performance, maybe the IN subquery with a GROUP BY would be faster, because the GROUP BY could allow the database to compute the counts once per case and then use that list for filtering, whereas the window function needs to compute for every row. But the problem says \"craft a DuckDB SQL query\". As per SQL standards, either solution would work. Which is more appropriate? Let me check the syntax for both."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Yes. That should do it. Let's verify with an example.\n\nSuppose there's a case_id A with 5 events. The subquery would include A, so all 5 events are returned. A case with 7 events is excluded.\nTesting edge cases: case with exactly 6 events would be included. Cases with 0? But in the table, case_id must have at least one event (since each row is an event). So the count per case is at least 1. So the query correctly includes cases with 1 to 6 events.\n\nAlternatively, the problem says \"more than six events\" are excluded, so cases with exactly 6 are kept. The HAVING clause is correct with <=6.\n\nYes. So the query should work."
