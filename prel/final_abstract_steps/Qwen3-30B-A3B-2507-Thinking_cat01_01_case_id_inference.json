The challenge is that there's no explicit case ID, so I have to infer it based on the attributes and sequence. Let me start by listing out all the events with their details to see if I can spot patterns."

Wait, event 3 is 08:07:15, so event 5 is 08:07:15, same time as event 3? Wait, the timestamps are: ... Wait, event 2 is 08:07:02, event 3 is 08:07:15, event 4 is 08:10:50, etc. So the order of events as per timestamp is correct as listed."

For 28M (events 3,6,9,13,16,18): Event 3: Register (Surgery) at 08:07:15 ...
