    "Text": "Starting with automation Where can automation be applied Maybe in the initial classification of the request type Right now Check Request Type is a gateway Maybe using AI or machine learning to automatically classify the request as standard or custom That could speed things up by reducing manual checks Also the parallel tasks credit check and inventory check These could be automated with systems that interface with credit databases or inventory management systems Maybe even real time checks instead of waiting for each to finish sequentially In the custom path the feasibility analysis could be automated with some kind of algorithm that assesses customization parameters Predictive analytics might help here too by predicting if a customization is feasible based on historical data The approval process maybe automate the approval if certain conditions are met For example if the delivery date is within a certain range or if the inventory is sufficient the system could auto approve reducing the need for manager intervention"
