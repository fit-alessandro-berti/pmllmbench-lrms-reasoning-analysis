Looping here might indicate inefficiency or errors, maybe someone is trying to force approvals or theres a bug causing repeated steps."

    "Text": "I should explain why these are problematic. For example, skipping credit checks bypasses risk assessment, which is a big red flag. The loop could be a symptom of a flawed process where approvals arent working correctly, leading to repeated steps. This affects conformance because the process isnt following expected steps, leading to potential errors or inefficiencies."
