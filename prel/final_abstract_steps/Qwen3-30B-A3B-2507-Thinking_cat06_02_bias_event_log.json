    "Text": "Ah heres the critical point C004 had a preliminary score of 690 got +10 to become 700 approved while someone with 690 without community affiliation would be rejected like if C003 had 715 but was rejected Wait C003 was 715 and rejected but had no community affiliation But C004 with 690 +10 700 and was approved So the 10-point boost made the difference between approval and rejection for C004 Comparing C003 715 rejected and C004 690 +10 700 approved the community affiliation effectively allowed someone with a lower base score to get approved This is the bias the adjustment is not based on creditworthiness but on social affiliation"

    "Text": "The user mentioned individuals who lack certain community affiliations so people who arent part of that specific darts club get no adjustment even if they have strong credit scores But in this log C005 had 740 without community affiliation and was approved so the boost isnt necessary for high scores The bias specifically hurts those with mid-range scores who dont have the affiliation Also the community group is named Highland Civic Darts Club this seems like a specific local group that might be harder for non-residents or people without social connections to join The bias might disproportionately affect New residents who havent joined clubs yet People from different cultural backgrounds if the club is homogeneous Those who dont participate in sports clubs e g due to disability time constraints"

    "Text": "The event log shows LocalResident is TRUE for C001 and C004 but the adjustment depends on CommunityGroup not residency So even if youre a local resident if youre not in that specific club you dont get the boost This creates a fairness issue because 1 It introduces an arbitrary factor club membership into scoring 2 It may correlate with demographics e g if the club is predominantly a certain ethnicity or income group 3 It disadvantages people without social capital to join such groups I should also note that the adjustment is called Community but its only for one specific group not community engagement in general Thats a red flag its not a broad community score but a specific club bonus"

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
