    "Text": "To identify significantly longer cases, a common criterion is any case that has a resolution time that is more than one or two standard deviations above the mean. Let us check the mean plus one standard deviation: 1224 + 1057.3 = 2281.3 minutes. This means any case taking more than 2281.3 minutes might be considered significantly longer than the average. Another way to identify outliers is to check any case that takes longer than the mean by a significant margin such as a 50% increase: 1.5 x 1224 = 1836 minutes. Based on this, any case taking more than 1836 minutes could be considered significantly longer. Based on the mean + one standard deviation threshold, only case 105 (2945 minutes) is significantly longer than the average (since 2945 > 2281.3). However, using a mean + 50% of mean threshold (1836 minutes), cases 102 (1510 minutes), 104 (1450 minutes), and 105 (2945 minutes) could be considered longer than average, but only cases where the total resolution time exceeds 1836 minutes (which would make cases 102 and 104 longer but not significantly longer compared to case 105). However, an intuitive comparison shows that cases 102 and 104 also took more than a day while cases 101 and 103 were resolved on the same day. Thus, cases 102, 104, and particularly 105 seem to take longer. However, case 105 takes by far the longest."

    "Text": "Factors that could be leading to increased cycle times: 1. Escalation to a higher-level agent or team: Cases 102 and 105 both experienced escalations (Escalate to Level-2 Agent), which seem to contribute to longer resolution times. This could indicate that escalations introduce new waiting times or that Level-2 agents have a higher workload or lower response times. 2. Overnight delays (working hours vs. non-working hours): For cases 102, 104, and 105, there are long gaps that span overnight periods where no activity is recorded until the next day. It seems that any activity that runs into the evening might only be picked up the next day, thus increasing the total case duration. 3. Investigation time and delays before resolving the ticket: For case 102, the Investigate Issue step took from 14:00 until 9:00 the next day (19 hours including an overnight period). For case 104, the Investigate Issue step took from 13:00 until 8:00 the next day (19 hours including an overnight period). For case 105, the Investigate Issue step occurred twice (once before and once after the escalation), with a 28-hour gap from Escalate to Level-2 Agent until the second Investigate Issue event which also spans an overnight period."

    "Text": "Propose insights or recommendations: 1. Streamline the escalation process: Make sure that once a ticket is escalated, there should be a quick handover and prompt action by the Level-2 agents. A possible way to do this is by verifying that Level-2 agents are not overloaded and are able to handle escalations efficiently. 2. Address working hours and round-the-clock support: If the nature of the business allows it, having round-the-clock support or at least extending support hours could help in reducing the overnight delays where no activities are logged until the next working day. Another option could be to make sure that tickets are assigned such that any ticket received is worked on until it reaches a state where it can be paused until the next day only if necessary. 3. Prioritize Investigate Issue step: Once a ticket is assigned, make sure that the Investigate Issue step occurs promptly. There seems to be a significant delay between Assign to Level-1 Agent and Investigate Issue in case 104 (3 hours 30 minutes), which should ideally be minimized. 4. Automate triage and assignment steps where possible: Automation could help in reducing the time between Receive Ticket and Investigate Issue steps. For instance, automated triage could help in immediately assigning the ticket to the right level. 5. Monitor and analyze escalations: Identify why cases are being escalated and if there are any common issues that could be addressed at the Level-1 agent stage through additional training or resources. These recommendations aim to reduce the total resolution times and make the process more efficient."
