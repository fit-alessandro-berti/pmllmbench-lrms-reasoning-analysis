    "Text": "First, I need to understand what a typical patient journey might look like in a hospital. For instance, in the Emergency Room (ER), a patient might go through registration, triage, consultation, maybe some tests, and then discharge. In Surgery, it could be registration, consultation, preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge."

    "Text": "At 08:10:50, there's an initial triage for the 45M in ER. Similarly, at 08:12:29, initial triage for the 62F in ER. Then, at 08:13:00, a doctor consultation for the 28M in Surgery. This makes sense: after registration, ER patients go to triage, while the Surgery patient goes directly to consultation since it's likely a scheduled surgery."

    "Text": "For example, the 45M in ER goes through registration, triage, X-ray imaging, consultation, and discharge. The 62F in ER goes through registration, triage, lab test request, lab test completion, consultation, prescription, and discharge. The 28M in Surgery goes through registration, consultation, preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge."

    "Text": "But just to double-check, let's see if there's any possibility of overlap or misassignment. For instance, is there any event that could belong to more than one case? For example, the X-ray imaging is in Radiology, but it's clearly for the 45M, as the patient_age and patient_gender match, and it fits in the sequence after triage and before consultation. Similarly, the lab test events are for the 62F, and the surgery-related events are for the 28M."
