GlobalTeq Solutions has a hiring process with several stages: resume parsing, skill assessment, cultural fit check, and managerial review. The potential bias comes in at the cultural fit stage where applicants with certain affiliations get preferential treatment."

    "Text": "For the first POWL model with unfairness, I need to represent the XOR branch. So after the skill assessment, theres a choice between a standard cultural fit check and a community affiliation check. This means using an XOR operator where one branch gives an advantage. Ill structure this by creating an OperatorPOWL with XOR, having the two checks as children. Then, Ill set the order so that after the skill assessment, this XOR choice happens."

    "Text": "For the second model without unfairness, Ill remove the XOR branch. All applicants go through the same cultural fit check without any special treatment. So, instead of an XOR, itll be a strict partial order where the cultural fit check follows the skill assessment directly. No community affiliation check is involved here."
