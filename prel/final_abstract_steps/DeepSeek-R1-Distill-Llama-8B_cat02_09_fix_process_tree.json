This isn't correct because each of these steps should happen in a specific sequence to prevent issues like paying an invoice before receiving goods or before it's matched to the Purchase Order."

For example, sometimes after receiving goods, you might need to issue a PO, but in this simplified model, that's already covered after the req is approved. So perhaps in this simplified version, all those steps are required in order without any choices."
