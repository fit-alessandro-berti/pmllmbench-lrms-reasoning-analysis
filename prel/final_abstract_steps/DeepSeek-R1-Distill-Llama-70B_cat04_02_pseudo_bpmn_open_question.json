    "Text": "Looking at the pseudo-BPMN, it begins with receiving a customer request. Then there's a gateway that checks if the request is standard or custom. For standard requests, it goes through validation, parallel checks for credit and inventory, calculates delivery date, and then moves on. For custom requests, it does a feasibility analysis, and based on that, either prepares a quotation or sends a rejection."

    "Text": "The initial tasks like receiving the request and checking the type are probably already automated, but maybe the validation tasks can be automated further. For example, using RPA for data entry or AI for validating standard requests without human intervention."

    "Text": "Dynamic resource allocation is another area. For parallel tasks like credit and inventory checks, maybe using a load balancer or assigning resources based on current workload can speed things up. If one check is taking longer, perhaps allocate more resources there temporarily."

    "Text": "Looking at the custom path, after feasibility analysis, if it's not feasible, sending a rejection makes sense. But if feasible, preparing a quotation could be made faster with automated templates. Also, the loop back if approval isn't granted seems inefficient. Maybe adding a subprocess that tries to adjust the quotation dynamically based on feedback without going all the way back."
