    "Text": "Now how do these factors contribute to increased cycle times Escalations often mean that the issue is more complex or requires specialized knowledge which inherently takes longer However the long waits after escalation suggest inefficiencies in handing off escalated tickets Long waiting times between activities could indicate that agents are overloaded or that there are manual handoffs or approvals that slow down the process Delays in starting investigations after assignments or escalations could mean that agents are busy with other tasks or that the process lacks clear priorities"
