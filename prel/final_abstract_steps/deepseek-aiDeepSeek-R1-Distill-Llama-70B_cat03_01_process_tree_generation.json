The RDT itself is an XOR between FCE and FBA. This loop continues until the results are normal, so the loop is structured as SC -> X(T, SPT) -> RDT, and then RDT loops back if needed."

Once the loop exits, its a parallel step of AI and NC, then FAS -> DDI, and finally a parallel step of BL, ICP, MRF."

So after the initial CE or FBP, the process enters a loop where SC is done, then treatment choice, then RDT, which is another XOR. The loop can repeat until the results are normal, so the loop is structured as * ( SC -> (X(T, SPT) -> RDT), something)."
