Consequences of deviations: If credit check is skipped, might approve high-risk loans. If documents arent gathered, might have incomplete info. Skipping QA could lead to non-compliant offers.

Or is it a mistake? Need to check the model again. The chainprecedence says Authorize_Contract_Terms targets Preliminary_Credit_Check. That might be a way to ensure that after authorization, a credit check is done again? Or maybe its a way to handle some feedback loop. But in the standard flow, after authorization, the next step is transfer funds. So maybe that constraint is for a different scenario, like if theres a need to recheck credit after authorization.
