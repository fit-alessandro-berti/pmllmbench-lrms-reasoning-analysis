    "Text": "We are given an event log for customer support tickets. We need to: 1. Identify cases with significantly longer resolution times. 2. Determine potential root causes of the delays. 3. Explain how these factors lead to delays and propose recommendations. Steps: - First, we will calculate the total resolution time for each case (from Receive Ticket to Close Ticket). - Then, we can compare the times to identify outliers. Lets compute the duration for each case: Case 101: Start: 2024-03-01 08:00 End: 2024-03-01 10:15 Duration: 2 hours and 15 minutes Case 102: Start: 2024-03-01 08:05 End: 2024-03-02 09:15 Duration: From 2024-03-01 08:05 to 2024-03-01 24:00 is 15 hours 55 minutes. Then 9 hours 15 minutes on the next day -> total 15h55m + 9h15m = 25 hours 10 minutes. Case 103: Start: 2024-03-01 08:10 End: 2024-03-01 09:30 Duration: 1 hour 20 minutes. Case 104: Start: 2024-03-01 08:20 End: 2024-03-02 08:30 Duration: From 2024-03-01 08:20 to 2024-03-01 24:00 is 15 hours 40 minutes. Then 8 hours 30 minutes on the next day -> total 15h40m + 8h30m = 24 hours 10 minutes. Case 105: Start: 2024-03-01 08:25 End: 2024-03-03 09:30 Duration: Day 1: from 08:25 to 24:00 -> 15 hours 35 minutes. Day 2: full day 24 hours. Day 3: 9 hours 30 minutes. Total: 15h35m + 24h + 9h30m = 49 hours 5 minutes. Now, lets list the durations: 101: 2h15m (135 minutes) 102: 25h10m (1510 minutes) 103: 1h20m (80 minutes) 104: 24h10m (1450 minutes) 105: 49h5m (2945 minutes)"

Resolve Ticket: next day 09:00 (19 hours after investigation in level-2) Close Ticket: 09:15. Observations: The escalation took a long time (2h30m to assign escalation and then after escalation it took 2h30m until investigation started?). But note: the event Escalate to Level-2 Agent is at 11:30, then the next event is at 14:00 for investigation. So there is a 2h30m gap after escalation and before investigation. Then a long gap from investigation (14:00) to resolution (next day 09:00) which is 19 hours. This might be because the level-2 agent didnt start immediately or the ticket was not picked up until the next day."

Then resolution next day at 08:00 (19 hours later) and closed at 08:30. Observations: After assignment (09:30), it took until 13:00 (3h30m) for the agent to start investigation. Why the delay?

But then the next event is escalation at 10:00 (50 minutes after investigation started?). Then it is escalated to Level-2 Agent at 10:00 on day 1.

Observations: After escalation at 10:00 on day 1, there was a huge delay (over 24 hours) until the Level-2 agent started the investigation on day 2 at 14:00. Then from investigation at 14:00 on day 2 to resolution at 09:00 on day 3 is 19 hours."

    "Text": "Potential Root Causes: 1. Delays in escalation handling: In case 102 and 105, after escalation there was a significant delay before the Level-2 agent started the investigation. 2. Long waiting time for assignment or investigation: - In case 104, the assignment to Level-1 took 3.5 hours to start investigation after assignment. - In case 102, the escalation event occurred at 11:30, but the investigation did not start until 14:00 (same day, 2.5 hours later) and then the resolution was next day (again, 19 hours later). So there were multiple delays. 3. Overnight delays: In several cases, there are gaps that span the overnight period, which might be due to agents working during business hours only. For example, in case 102, the investigation started at 14:00 and then the next event is the next day at 09:00. This might be because the agent left and didnt work on it until the next day. 4. Unnecessary delays after investigation start? Or perhaps the issue was complex and took time? But note that in case 101 and 103, we did not have escalations and the entire process was done within the same day. Also, the investigation duration in case 101 was 1 hour (from 09:00 to 10:00) and in 103 was 30 minutes (08:45 to 09:15). However, in case 102, after escalation the investigation took 19 hours (from 14:00 to next day 09:00) and then resolution and closure were quick. Similarly, in case 105, after escalation the investigation took 19 hours (from 14:00 to next day 09:00). But note: the event Investigate Issue might be a point in time when the activity started, and then the resolution is the next step. So the time from investigation to resolution should be the active work. However, if the agent is not working continuously, the gap might be due to non-working hours or switching between tickets. However, in case 104, after investigation (13:00) the resolution was next day 08:00 (19 hours). And in case 105, after investigation (14:00) the resolution was next day 09:00 (19 hours). This suggests that the agent might have set the ticket aside and not worked on it until the next business day. 5. Escalation to Level-2 Agent might be a bottleneck: The time between escalation and when the Level-2 agent starts working on it can be very long. In case 105, it took over 24 hours."

    "Text": "Recommendations: 1. Monitor and reduce the time between escalation and when the escalated ticket is picked up by the Level-2 team. This might involve setting SLAs for escalation handling or having a dedicated resource for escalated tickets. 2. For Level-1 agents, ensure that once a ticket is assigned, they start working on it promptly. There might be a need for training or better workload management to avoid long queues. 3. For overnight delays, consider the possibility of extending support hours or having shift handovers to avoid tickets being left untouched overnight. Alternatively, setting expectations for customers that resolution might take 24-48 hours for complex issues. 4. Analyze the root cause of escalations to see if there are opportunities for Level-1 agents to resolve more issues without escalation. This could involve additional training or better knowledge bases. 5. Implement better tracking of the time each ticket spends in each state (e.g., assign, escalate, investigate) to identify systemic delays. 6. Consider a follow-up process: if a ticket hasnt been updated for a certain period (e.g., 4 hours), an alert could be sent to the assigned agent or the supervisor to check the status. 7. For the Level-2 team, ensure adequate staffing so that escalated tickets are prioritized and picked up quickly. 8. If the delay in investigation to resolution is due to waiting for customer response, then set clear timelines for customer responses and have an automated reminder system. However, note that the event log does not capture the reason for delays (like waiting for customer input). But since the problem states to consider factors such as escalations, long waiting times between activities, or unnecessary delays, we have identified these."

    "Text": "Summary of cases with long resolution times: Case 102: 25h10m Case 104: 24h10m Case 105: 49h5m The main factors we see are: - Escalations leading to long waiting times for Level-2 agents to start work (case 102 and 105). - Long gaps between assignment and investigation (case 104). - Overnight delays that add a full business day (or more) to the cycle. We propose the above recommendations to address these issues."
