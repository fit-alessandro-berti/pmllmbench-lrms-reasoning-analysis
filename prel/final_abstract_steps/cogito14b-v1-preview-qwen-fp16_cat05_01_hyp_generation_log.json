In the normal flow, after Registering an Order (Sales), we should do a Credit Check (Finance) before validating stock or shipping."

Then theres a Perform Credit Check later which is out of sequence. This could be an issue with workflow automation or maybe human error where someone confirmed shipment before credit checks were done."
