    "Text": "Now Model 2 The nodes include Post Screen Interview Decide a looponboarding which is a loop with Onboard and a silent transition an xorpayroll XOR between Payroll and silent and Close The edges are PostScreen and PostInterview Wait Post leads to both Screen and Interview That means after posting the job both screening and interviewing can start in parallel But in reality you need to screen candidates first before interviewing them So having Interview happen in parallel with Screen is an anomaly Because you cant interview candidates until youve screened them So Model 2 allows interviewing to start immediately after posting the job without waiting for screening Thats a problem Then Interview leads to Decide So after interviewing you make the decision That part is correct Then Decide leads to looponboarding The looponboarding is a loop between Onboard and a silent transition So this means that Onboarding can be repeated But once you decide to hire onboarding should happen once right Unless theres a scenario where onboarding needs to be repeated but thats unusual So maybe the loop here is an anomaly Although maybe in some cases onboarding could have multiple steps but the loop operator here allows repetition But in a normative process onboarding is typically a single activity after hiring So introducing a loop might be unnecessary or an anomaly depending on context Then after the loop it goes to xorpayroll which is an exclusive choice between Payroll and silent So after onboarding you either add to payroll or skip it But adding to payroll is a mandatory step after hiring So having an XOR where you can skip payroll is a severe anomaly You must add the employee to payroll so the option to skip that is incorrect So in Model 2 the anomalies are 1 Interviews can start before screening Post leads to both Screen and Interview 2 Onboarding has a loop which might not be necessary 3 Payroll addition is optional XOR with silent which is wrong"

    "Text": "Comparing the two models Model 1s main anomaly is Decide before Interview which is a critical flaw because you cant decide without interviewing Model 2s anomalies include starting interviews too early optional payroll very bad and a loop in onboarding less severe maybe So which model is closer to normative Model 1 has a critical error in the decision step while Model 2 has multiple errors including a very severe one skipping payroll But wait Model 1s structure after Decide is okay The problem is the order of Interview and Decide In Model 1 since Screen leads to both but theres no order between Decide and Interview they can happen in any order So possibly Decide happens before Interview which is impossible in reality then thats a big problem Alternatively maybe Model 1s partial order allows for the correct path Screen Interview Decide as one possible execution but also allows incorrect paths Whereas Model 2s structure prevents the correct path altogether because Interview can start too early Wait in Model 1 the partial order defines that Screen must come before both Interview and Decide but theres no order between Interview and Decide So possible executions include Screen Interview Decide correct or Screen Decide Interview incorrect So the model allows both which means its underconstrained and permits an anomaly In Model 2 the partial order allows Interview to happen without Screen which is a bigger issue because its not just order but a missing prerequisite"

    "Text": "So which anomaly is more severe Missing prerequisite Model 2 vs incorrect order Model 1 Both are bad But in a normative process the order of Interview then Decide is crucial So Model 1 allows a wrong order but maintains prerequisites Model 2 violates prerequisites I think violating prerequisites Model 2 is more severe Because even if the order is wrong in Model 1 at least all necessary steps are done though in wrong order but in Model 2 a necessary step screening might be skipped for interviewing Therefore Model 1 is closer to the normative process despite its anomaly because Model 2s anomaly is more fundamental"
