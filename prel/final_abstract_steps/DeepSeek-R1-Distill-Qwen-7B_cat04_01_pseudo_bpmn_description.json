    "Text": "Then, there's a gateway labeled Check Request Type, which splits the process into two paths: Standard and Custom. For Standard requests, it goes through some validations, runs parallel checks, and then calculates a delivery date. For Custom requests, it evaluates if customization is feasible. If yes, it prepares a quotation; if no, sends a rejection notice."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Text": "I should start by outlining the overall process flow, then detail each step. For gateways, I'll explain XOR and AND, and how they affect the flow. Convergence points are where different paths meet again, so I'll highlight those. approvals and rework steps need careful explanation, especially how Custom requests might loop back to reevaluate."

    "Text": "I should also ensure that I don't make any incorrect assumptions about the process. For example, in the Custom path, the loop back after rejection notice seems like it's a standard process, but I should note that if the request were Custom and feasible, it goes through approval steps, otherwise, it loops back to the same point."
