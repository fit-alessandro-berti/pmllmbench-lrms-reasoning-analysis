For Standard requests, it goes through some validations, runs parallel checks, and then calculates a delivery date. For Custom requests, it evaluates if customization is feasible. If yes, it prepares a quotation; if no, sends a rejection notice."

    "Text": "I should also ensure that I don't make any incorrect assumptions about the process. For example, in the Custom path, the loop back after rejection notice seems like it's a standard process, but I should note that if the request were Custom and feasible, it goes through approval steps, otherwise, it loops back to the same point."
