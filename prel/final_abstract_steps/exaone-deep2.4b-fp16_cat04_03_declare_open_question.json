In real life, this would be the customer submitting the application. The model's existence section mentions this with support and confidence 1.0, meaning it's a sure thing. The absence of Proceed_Without_Compliance (Z) suggests that proceeding without compliance is impossible here."

The model has exactly one instance of this check, ensuring it's done once. This prevents skipping the check, which is crucial for compliance and risk management."

The model's coexistence rule with Gather_Additional_Documents points to collaboration or mutual dependencies with other steps, maybe ensuring all necessary docs are collected before proceeding."
