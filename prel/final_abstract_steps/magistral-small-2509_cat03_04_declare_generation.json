Maybe the correct interpretation is that for a key like response, the dictionary has keys that are activities, and the value is another dictionary where keys are the related activities and values are support/confidence. For example, for response, the value could be: IG: DD: support 1.0 confidence 1.0 This seems plausible. Lets assume that for the pairwise relation keys, the dictionary has activities as keys, and the value is another dictionary where keys are the related activities and values are support/confidence."

The other keys like precedence might not be necessary, so we can leave them empty. ... This seems to match the description."
