The loop back might occur in the case where after rejection (E2), the process continues but thats not a loop. Alternatively, perhaps the re-evaluate conditions in Task H (under the no approval needed path) loops back to Task E1 again? Not sure. Maybe the loop is in the approval process. For example, if approval is denied (Task H), then the process might loop back to Task E1 to re-evaluate? But according to the code, after Task H, it just ends?
