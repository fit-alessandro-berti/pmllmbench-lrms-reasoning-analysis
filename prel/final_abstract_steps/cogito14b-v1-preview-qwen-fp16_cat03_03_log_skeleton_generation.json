But maybe there's no strict equivalence here except perhaps for paired steps like RI and PI if reservation and picking are always together. Hmm."

Then CA comes after RO but before RI since you can't reserve without checking availability first. Similarly, QC must happen after Pick Items (PI). Maybe GSL comes after PO because you need to pack the order before generating a shipping label."

CA after RO (maybe 0 or 1 if some orders don't need availability checks?), but typically it would be exactly once. RI follows CA (again once), PI same as above. QC should happen after PI, so once. PO maybe once as well. GSL once after PO. Dispatch once per order. IC and RP could both occur once."
