Also, there are loops, like the Re-Testing (RT) which seems to loop back to TST if the test fails. The TST activity might have a loop where if RT is needed again, it goes back."

    "Text": "Based on the repetition of IQC in Cases 1, 3, and 5, this strongly suggests that IQC is part of a loop where multiple quality checks can be executed after AS. Alternatively, this can be viewed as separate steps modeled via a loop operator."
