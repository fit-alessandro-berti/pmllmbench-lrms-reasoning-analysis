Wait, but the loop_iqc is an OperatorPOWL node, which itself contains the loop between AS and IQC. So when executing the loop_iqc node, it processes the loop between its children. Therefore, the order edges should ensure that after AS comes the loop_iqc, which allows looping between AS and IQC. However, the loop_iqc nodes children are AS and IQC, so when executing the loop_iqc node, it first does AS, then either exits the loop to TST or does IQC and loops back to AS. This way, the loop_iqc node is placed after AS and before TST, allowing the loop to occur between those points. Similarly, the loop_tst_rt is placed after TST and before PK, allowing the loop between TST and RT. The choice_lb node is an XOR between LB and Silent, so after PK comes this choice node, which leads to either LB or Silent, then to DP. This structure should capture the required paths and loops."

The multiple IQC steps in Case 1 are handled by the loop between AS and IQC, allowing multiple iterations. This seems to cover the event logs provided.
