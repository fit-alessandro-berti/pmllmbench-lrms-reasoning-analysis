Wait, 48 hours is two days, so maybe its exactly on time? Let me check the timestamp. The Loan Decision was at 12:00 on the 14th, and Inform was at 15:00 on the 16th. Thats 47 hours, so just under 48? Hmm, depends on exact timing. The problem says the recommendation is within 48 hours. So maybe its okay? Or maybe the example says its a violation. The users note in the log says its a desideratum violation, so Ill go with that. Also, theres no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum."

So for normative violations, Case 2 has two issues: out of order Credit Check and Risk Assessment, and Finalize Docs after rejection. Case 1 is okay. Case 3s issues are desiderata. For desiderata, Case 2 also has some? Wait, the desiderata are about timing and follow-up. In Case 2, the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative issue, so thats not a desideratum. The desiderata for Case 2: I dont see any timing issues mentioned except maybe the Follow-up Call. Wait, looking back, the desiderata include Follow-up Call before closing. The log for Case 2 doesnt mention a Follow-up Call, so thats a desideratum violation too. Wait, the log for Case 2s notes mention that Finalize Doc after rejection is not allowed, but does it mention Follow-up? Looking at the table: the last row for Case 2 has no mention, so maybe the Follow-up was skipped there as well. Wait, in the table provided, for Case 3, theres a note in the last row saying (No Follow-up Call). For Case 2, is there a note? Looking at the table: the last row for Case 2 has no mention, but according to the log, the activities dont include Follow-up Call anywhere. The desiderata says its encouraged but not required. So all cases might be violating the Follow-up? Wait, the log for Case 1: looking at the activities listed for Case 1, theres no Follow-up Call. The users example in the log for Case 3 mentions its missing, but the others might also miss it. But the problems example in the log only highlights Case 3, maybe the question wants us to mention that Case 2 and 3 have desideratum violations (since Case 3s Credit Check took too long and the inform was late, plus no follow-up.

Case 2: Normative violations: Risk Assessment before Credit Check (normative violation) Finalize Docs after rejection (not allowed) Desiderata: The Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment, but thats a normative issue. The desiderata would be if Credit Check was delayed beyond 24h? Wait, in Case 2, the Credit Check was done at 09:00 on 1/11, which is after the Risk Assessment at 08:20? Wait, the timestamps for Case 2: Application at 08:00. Then Risk Assessment at 08:20 (before Credit Check at 09:00). So the Credit Check was done 40 minutes after application. Thats within 24h, so the 24h desideratum is okay. The problem is the order (Risk before Credit, which is a normative issue). So the desiderata for Credit Check timing in Case 2 is okay. The Inform Applicant for Case 2: When was the Loan Decision? At 09:30 (Rejected). Then Inform at ... Wait, looking at Case 2s log: Case 2s steps after Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30) would be Inform Applicant?

Wait, but in the log, the line after Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30) would be Inform Applicant? Wait the log shows after Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), the next step is Finalize Docs at 10:00? Wait thats a problem. According to the normative process, after Loan Decision comes Inform Applicant. So in Case 2, after Loan Decision (09:30), they should first inform the applicant before closing. But according to the log, the next step after Loan Decision is Finalize Docs (which is wrong because its rejected, but also, they skipped Inform Applicant? Wait, the logs entry for Case 2 after Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30) is: Next is Finalize Docs at 10:00, then Close at 10:30. But according to the normative steps, after Loan Decision comes Inform Applicant. So missing the Inform step? Or is the Inform step part of the Finalize Docs? Wait, the normative process says after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant before proceeding. So in Case 2, they skipped the Inform step? That would be a normative violation. Wait, looking at the log: Wait checking the table again. The table for Case 2 has the sequence: After Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), the next is Finalize Docs (10:00). So the Inform step is missing, which is a normative violation. Wait, the normative rules say Inform must happen after Loan Decision. So if they didnt do that, thats a skipped step. So thats another normative violation. So Case 2 has multiple normative issues: 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order) 2. Finalize Docs after rejection (contradiction) 3. Missing Inform Applicant (skipped mandatory step) Wait the sequence must be ... Loan Decision Inform Applicant [if approved, do Finalize Docs]. So if they skip Inform, thats a normative violation. So for Case 2, the normative violations include: 1. Incorrect order (Risk before Credit) 2. Finalizing Docs on rejection (which is a normative violation because they shouldnt do that). 3. Skipping the Inform step entirely (another normative violation). Additionally, the order of Credit Check after Risk is the main one."

Lets see: Application Credit Check (on 1/14 vs received on 1/12 thats 2 days later, but thats a desideratum issue (24h not met).

So the sequence is correct, so no normative issues except the Credit Check was late (but thats desideratum). Wait, the normative sequence requires Credit Check before Risk Assessment. In Case 3, the order is correct: Credit Check at 1/14 10:00 comes after Application (1/12 09:00). Then Risk Assessment after Credit. So the order is correct. The 24-hour delay is a desideratum, not a normative issue. So Case 3s normative steps are okay."

Follow-up Call is missing. So desiderata violations: no Follow-up Call. Case 2: The Credit Check was done within a day (same day as application), so 2 hours after application, so within 24h. The Inform step was... wait, in Case 2, the Inform step is missing entirely. But the desiderata about timing requires informing within 48h of Loan Decision. Since they didnt do it at all, thats a normative violation (since the normative rules require Inform Applicant after Loan Decision). So thats a normative violation. Wait, so the missing Inform is a normative issue, not desideratum. So the desiderata timing for Inform only applies if they did the step. Since they skipped the step entirely, thats a normative issue. Therefore, the Inform Applicant step is mandatory, so skipping it is a normative violation. Now, moving to the desiderata for Case 2: The Credit Check was within 24 hours (since same day, so okay) The Inform step wasnt done, but thats a normative issue. Follow-up Call was not done (since the log for Case 2 doesnt have it). The tables log for Case 2 doesnt list a Follow-up Call, so thats a desideratum violation. Case 3s desiderata: Credit Check was 2 days after application (since Application on 1/12, Credit Check on 1/14 44 hours later, over 24h desideratum violation. The Inform Applicant was 2 days after the Loan Decision (Decision on 1/14 12:00, then Inform was at 1/16 15:00?

The log shows for Case 3: After Loan Decision (Approved at 12:00), the next entries are: Inform Applicant is at 2024-01-16 15:00. Wait, the table for Case 3 shows after Loan Decision (Approved on 1/14 12:00): The next steps are (from the table): After Loan Decision (Approved at 12:00 on 1/14): Next step is Inform Applicant on 1/16 15:00 (2 days later). The desideratum says within 48 hours. The Loan Decision was at 12:00 on 1/14, so 48 hours would be by 1/16 12:00. The Inform was at 1/16 15:00, which is 3 hours late, so thats a desideratum violation. Also, Case 3 didnt do a Follow-up Call (as noted in the tables last line for Case 3: (No Follow-up Call)."

Case3: Both the Credit Check timing and the Inform timing, plus no Follow-up. Now, the task says for part 1: identify normative violations. Also, in Case 2, the Finalize Docs after rejection is normative. Now, for task 3, suggest interpretations. For example, maybe in Case 2, the staff might have made a mistake in the order, or maybe the system allowed it erroneously. Or maybe they forgot to inform the applicant, leading to the Finalize Docs error. Similarly, in Case3, the late Credit Check might be due to backlog, and the late inform due to delays, but its just a recommendation. Putting this all together, now I can structure the answers."
