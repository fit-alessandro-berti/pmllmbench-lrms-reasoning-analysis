We need to compute the total duration for each case from first event to last event and identify which cases are taking significantly longer. Then analyze how Resource Region Complexity correlate with longer durations. Lets compute durations Case 2001 First 2024-04-01 0900 Last 2024-04-01 1030 Duration 15 hours Case 2002 First 2024-04-01 0905 Last 2024-04-02 1100 Duration approx 2592 hours Case 2003 First 2024-04-01 0910 Last 2024-04-03 0930 Duration approx 4833 hours Case 2004 First 2024-04-01 0920 Last 2024-04-01 1045 Duration 142 hours Case 2005 First 2024-04-01 0925 Last 2024-04-04 1430 Duration approx 7708 hours Clearly cases 2002 2003 2005 are much longer than 2001 and 2004"
