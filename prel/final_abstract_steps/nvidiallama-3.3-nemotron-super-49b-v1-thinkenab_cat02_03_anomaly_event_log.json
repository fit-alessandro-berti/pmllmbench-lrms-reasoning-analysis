    "Text": "Now why are these problematic For Case 1002 skipping approval could lead to unauthorized purchases Approving after the fact is not proper Also paying before goods are received could lead to paying for undelivered items Receiving goods after payment is risky as you might have paid without verifying receipt Case 1003 Releasing payment before receiving goods or invoice means paying without confirmation of delivery risking fraud or errors Case 1004 Receiving goods without a PO could be unauthorized and makes matching with invoices difficult Issuing PO after receipt is irregular and may lead to compliance issues or incorrect accounting"
