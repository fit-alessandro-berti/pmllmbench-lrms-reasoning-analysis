    "Text": "Let me define places that represent the states Possible places Start place with token initially After C before CR Or combine Better to have transitions for activities and places in between So Place p_start initial marking Transition t_C Insurance Claim Arc from p_start to t_C Place p_after_C After t_C it should go to CR Perhaps p_start t_C p_claim_filed t_CR p_claim_registered t_DV p_documents_verified etc But with loops For the DV loop after t_DV if documents incomplete it might go to t_RDS then back to t_DV So after p_documents_verified No Typically after a transition like DV we have a place and from that place depending on the outcome different transitions can fire In standard Petri nets without inhibitors we use places to model choices So for DV after DV is done there might be a place that has tokens and then transitions for continue if verified or go to RDS But DV is the verification activity so perhaps From p_before_DV t_DV and then to a place p_DV_outcome But p_DV_outcome could split one arc to p_verified_good leading to FC another to p_verified_bad leading to RDS In Petri nets a place can have multiple outgoing arcs to different transitions but the transition that fires depends on which is enabled Since its a choice based on data in workflow nets we often use multiple arcs from a place Standard way is to have a place after an activity and from that place multiple transitions can be possible but only one should fire based on the process logic In Petri net simulation it might nondeterministically choose but for modeling its ok"

    "Text": "To model the choice explicitly I can have two places after DV or use a pattern A common way is t_DV fires produces a token in p_after_DV From p_after_DV there is an arc to t_FC if verified but since we cant have conditions perhaps have two transitions from p_after_DV one for verified and one for not verified but transitions should be labeled with activities Perhaps better to model RDS as a separate path Let me think of the flow From t_CR p_after_CR t_DV after DV if good to t_FC if bad to t_RDS then after RDS back to DV So in Petri net Place p_after_CR Transition t_DV Arc from p_after_CR to t_DV After t_DV need to go to different places Transition t_DV consumes a token from p_after_CR and produces tokens in output places I can have t_DV with two output places p_verified_good and p_verified_bad Then from p_verified_good arc to t_FC From p_verified_bad arc to t_RDS Then t_RDS output to p_after_RDS and arc from p_after_RDS to t_DV back to verification After t_RDS it should go back to DV so perhaps t_RDS outputs to a place that is input to t_DV or directly Better to have a place between Define After t_DV if good go to p_ready_for_FC If bad go to p_need_resubmission Then from p_need_resubmission t_RDS p_after_RDS back to p_ready_for_DV No t_DV should have input from a place that represents ready for DV So lets define the places as states before activities Standard way in workflow Petri nets is to have places representing the state where an activity is enabled So p_start initial t_C input p_start output p_claim_filed t_CR input p_claim_filed output p_ready_for_DV t_DV input p_ready_for_DV but output depends For choices we can have the transition output to different places So for t_DV input from p_ready_for_DV output to p_documents_verified which then leads to FC or to p_documents_incomplete But a transition can have multiple output places so when t_DV fires it can produce tokens in multiple places but typically for exclusive choices we model it with the place having multiple outgoing transitions not from a transition outputting to multiple Better to model the choice after the activity So for DV instead of t_DV outputting to two places have t_DV output to a single place say p_after_DV and from p_after_DV two transitions one for verified ok but transitions should be labeled with activities Thats the issue In workflow modeling with Petri nets for activities with outcomes we often model the activity as a transition and the outcome as the place or subsequent transitions A common way is to have the place before the decision point have multiple outgoing transitions not from a transition outputting to multiple So the best way is to have a place before the choice and from that place multiple transitions For the DV activity the choice is part of its outcome so perhaps model it as the place after DV has the token and the next activity is chosen But for the loop when we go to RDS after RDS we return to DV So perhaps t_DV output to p_after_DV from p_after_DV arc to t_FC for ok case and arc to t_RDS for not ok case t_RDS input p_after_DV output p_ready_for_DV back to DV Similarly for FC t_FC output to p_after_FC From p_after_FC arc to t_CA if cleared and arc to t_II if doubt t_II input p_after_FC output p_ready_for_FC But p_ready_for_FC is not defined if t_FC input is p_after_DV then for t_II output to p_after_DV When t_II outputs to p_after_DV p_after_DV has the token and from p_after_DV it can go to t_FC or t_RDS but it should only go to t_FC To fix I need a different place for the input to t_FC From t_DV output to p_ready_for_FC when ok but since t_DV can only output to one place for the choice I cant So perhaps for the DV outcome have p_after_DV with arc to t_FC and t_RDS and for FC when t_FC is fired it has its own output p_after_FC and from p_after_FC arc to t_CA and t_II and t_II output to p_after_DV or to a new place Ill use a separate place for the back from II For example t_II output to p_back_from_II and p_back_from_II arc to t_FC But t_FC has input from p_after_DV so t_FC can have multiple input places but again it would require tokens in all Unless I make t_FC have a single input place Perhaps make p_after_DV only for the choice to FC or RDS and for FC when it is fired it has its own loop I think the simplest way is to have for each activity with choice the place after it has the choice For FC p_after_FC has arc to t_CA and t_II and t_II output to p_after_FC so it can loop on FC and II Similarly for DV p_after_DV has arc to t_FC and t_RDS and t_RDS output to p_after_DV so it can loop on DV and RDS And for the transition between when t_FC is fired from p_after_DV it goes to p_after_FC and from there it can go to t_CA or back to t_II In this way the fraud check is done after DV and if there is doubt it can investigate and re-check fraud independently of DV Which might be ok for the model Similarly for CA and AP"
