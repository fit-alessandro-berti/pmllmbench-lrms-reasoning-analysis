    "Text": "Then A to C Assign to Close averages 2 hours Thats really fast Closing a claim right after assigning an adjuster doesnt make sense unless the claim was immediately resolved But the process steps include Evaluate and Approve before Closing So maybe some claims are being closed without going through all necessary steps or theres a data entry error where the close event is recorded too early"

    "Text": "Now for hypotheses The R to P anomaly might be due to automated approval after a fixed period or maybe all approvals are batched at certain times The P to N delay could be due to manual notification processes that are understaffed The quick A to C might be because some claims are trivial and resolved immediately but thats unlikely given the process steps More likely theres a data issue where close events are incorrectly timestamped The E to N speed might be because the system automatically sends a notification upon evaluation but that should only happen after approval so maybe approvals are being done in the same step as evaluation without proper logging"
