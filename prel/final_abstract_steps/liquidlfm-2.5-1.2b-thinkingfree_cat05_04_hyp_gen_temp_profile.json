    "Text": "First, looking at the anomalies identified: RP (Receive to Approve) with very low STDEV implies maybe too rigid scheduling. PN is also suspicious because of the long delay. AC is okay but quick close might not fit, EN quick evaluate-to-notify, and NC too quick close."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "For hypotheses, I need to think of possible reasons. Like maybe automated systems assigning claims quickly when not supposed to, or manual delays in approval. Or maybe different adjusters are involved in different scenarios."

    "Text": "Hypotheses could be: Maybe the RP anomaly is due to a bottleneck where adjusters are queuing up too much or procedures are too slow. Or perhaps data entry errors causing delays in P."

    "Text": "For verification queries: Pick specific tables like claims with R followed by P, or P followed by N. Maybe something like SELECT * FROM claims WHERE adjuster_id IN (list_of_adjusters_involved) ORDER BY submission_date DESC WHERE (P-TIMESTAMP - A-TIMESTAMP) exceeds threshold OR something checking for high variance in times."

    "Text": "Alternatively, since the example uses SQL, perhaps grouping by adjuster and checking time gaps between activities. For instance, HYPOTHESIS: Anomaly in RP might be due to overuse of automation leading to inconsistent path through the process. Verification query: SELECT a.adjuster_name, (claim_event.type) AS type, (TIMESTAMP FROM claim_events.unique_event_id) - (TIMESTAMP FROM claim_events.unique_event_id) AS delta_time WHERE a.adjuster_id LIKE %x% AND NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM claim_events WHERE event_id IN (SELECT event_id FROM claims WHERE adjuster_id = x)) AND WHERE avg(TIMESTAMP_BETWEEN[R,A,P]... Not sure. Maybe simpler:"

Since the user said not to reference prior info, I just need to present hypotheses like possible reasons and then the SQL queries. Let me structure the answer accordingly."
