First, Ill check each case ID to see if the activities follow a normal flow. For Case 1001, everything seems in order: create requisition, approve it, then issue PO. Then receive goods, get invoice, match, release payment, close case. Thats typical."

    "Text": "Looking at Case 1002, the first thing that stands out is the Purchase Order being issued before approving the Requisition. The steps are: Create Req, Issue PO, Invoice Received, Release Payment, then Approve Requisition? Wait, that doesnt make sense. Normally, youd approve a requisition first before issuing an order. This could be risky because it skips approval and might lead to unauthorized purchases."

    "Text": "Next, Case 1003 has the payment released way early on February 8th, but the invoice wasnt received until February 9th. Releasing payment without having the invoice matched yet is unusual. It might cause discrepancies if the amount doesnt match or theres a delay in receiving the actual goods."

    "Text": "For Case 1004, the order of activities seems odd too: Creating the requisition and approving it on Feb 5th. Then they receive goods on Feb 6th (before issuing PO), followed by issuing the PO next? That violates standard procedures since you shouldnt receive goods without a valid PO in place. It could lead to inventory issues or supplier payment problems."
