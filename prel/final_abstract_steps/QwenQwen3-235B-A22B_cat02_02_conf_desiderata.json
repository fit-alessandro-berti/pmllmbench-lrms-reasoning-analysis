The strict sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  If Approved: Finalize Documentation  Close Case. So each case must follow this exact order, with no skipping or reversing. Also, specific ordering rules: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk before Loan Decision, Inform after Loan Decision. For approved loans, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. For rejected, no Finalize Documentation."

    "Text": "Case 2: - Application Received, then Risk Assessment without a prior Credit Check. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment). Then Credit Check happens later. Then Loan Decision (Rejected), followed by Finalize Documentation. But since it's rejected, Finalize Documentation shouldn't be there. So two violations: order of Risk Assessment and Credit Check, and Finalize after rejection."

Then Risk Assessment, Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant after 48 hours (from 1/14 12:00 to 1/16 15:00 is 2 days 3 hours, which is over 48 hours? Wait, 1/14 12:00 to 1/16 12:00 is 48 hours, then 3 more hours. So yes, Inform Applicant is late. Also, no Follow-up Call. So these are desiderata issues but not normative violations. Also, Finalize Documentation and Close Case in order. So Case 3 doesn't violate normative rules, just the recommended timings and follow-up."
