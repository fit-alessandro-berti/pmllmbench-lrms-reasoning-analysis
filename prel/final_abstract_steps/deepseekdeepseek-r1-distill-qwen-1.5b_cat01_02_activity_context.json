    "Text": "First, I need to identify which activities repeat within the same case. Lets go through each case one by one. Starting with Case C001. The activities are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, and Approve Request. These look like they happen in a sequence. The first two are related to an online portal, then a frontline agent handling documents and missing info, and finally a supervisor. Case C002 seems similar. Initiate Request again, then verify, call, adjust account, another call confirming, and approve. So its almost the same as C001 but with different people. The first two are portal, then frontline, internal adjust, then supervisor. Case C003 is different. Initiate Request, verify documents, call, adjust account, another call confirming, and approve. Wait, but all of them have verify again. So its walk-in, physical, phone, adjust, confirm again, approve. The activities are all related to customer service."

    "Text": "Now, looking at the activities: - Verify Documents is used multiple times, both before and after adjustments. So maybe this is a key activity that indicates the process of reviewing documents, whether its before or after something else. - Call Customer is used for clarifications and follow-ups. It could be that this is a recurring activity, but Im not sure yet. - Call Customer is also used in C003, so its in multiple cases. Maybe its a standard activity. - Adjust Account is only in C003. Its internal, so perhaps its a more specific step. - Submit Additional and Approve Request are only in C001 and C002. These are final steps, probably once per case. - WebPortal, BranchReception, and BranchOfficer are all related to customer service and specific branches. WebPortal is online; others are phone-related."

    "Text": "Now, for each activity that repeats, I need to decide the new name: 1. Initiate Request: This happens multiple times in each case. Its a base activity, so maybe it stays as Initiate Request. 2. Verify Documents: It seems to occur before and after adjustments. Since the process involves verification before an adjustment, maybe its better to rename it to Verify Adjustment or something that implies its before the adjustment. 3. Call Customer: Its a recurring activity. Since its about clarifying or following up, maybe Rename it to Clarification Call. 4. Submit Additional: This is a final step and only once per case, so it might stay as Submit Additional. 5. Adjust Account: Since its a specific internal step, perhaps Rename it to Internal Adjustment. 6. Approve Request: Once per case, so its fine as Approve Request. 7. Verify Documents (second time): Since its after an adjustment, maybe rename it to Verify Adjustment. 8. Call Customer (second time): Its a follow-up, so Clarification Call. 9. Call Customer (third time): Another confirmation call, so Clarification Call again. 10. Submit Additional (third time): Again, its a final step, so it stays. 11. Approve Request (third time): Once per case, so its fine."

    "Text": "Now, I need to adjust the timestamps and resource identifiers accordingly. Also, the context will make the activities clear. For each activity after renaming, I have to make sure that the new name reflects its role. For example, Verify Adjustment is about checking after an adjustment, which makes sense. I should also check if the names overlap or if theres a better name. For example, Verify Documents after adjustment seems a bit odd, so rename it to Verify Adjustment."
