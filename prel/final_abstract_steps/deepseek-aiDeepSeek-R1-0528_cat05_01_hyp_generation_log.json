Understand the normal process flow: Register Order -> Perform Credit Check -> Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods -> Issue Invoice -> Receive Payment 2. Look at the provided event logs for each case: Case 1001: Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment. This follows the normal flow. Case 1002: Events: Register Order, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment. Anomaly: - Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods happened before Credit Check and Stock Validation. - This is out of order. Case 1003: Events: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Receive Payment. Anomaly: - Ship Goods happened before Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment? - Actually, Validate Stock is missing? But wait, we have: event 16: Credit Check -> event 17: Ship Goods -> event 18: Issue Invoice -> event 19: Confirm Shipment -> event 20: Receive Payment. - Missing Validate Stock activity? But note: event 17 is Ship Goods and then event 19 is Confirm Shipment? - The normal flow says: Validate Stock -> Confirm Shipment -> Ship Goods. - Here, Ship Goods happened before Confirm Shipment? And Validate Stock is missing? - Actually, looking at the events: We have no Validate Stock event. And Confirm Shipment is after Ship Goods? That is reversed. Case 1004: Events: Register Order, Receive Payment, Issue Invoice, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods. Anomaly: - Receive Payment happened right after Register Order and before Issue Invoice? - Also missing Credit Check, Validate Stock?"

Hypothesize reasons: a) Case 1002: - Why would they confirm shipment and ship goods before credit check? - Hypothesis: * The order was marked as priority (check orders table: order_type=priority for case 1002) and they tried to expedite shipping? * But then credit check failed? Actually, credit check was done later and passed (credit_score=650). * Policy violation: shipping before credit check? b) Case 1003: - Missing Validate Stock? Why? * Maybe the system didnt require it? Or it was skipped? - Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? * This is reversed. Normally, shipment should be confirmed before shipping. * Why? Maybe the warehouse clerk shipped without waiting for confirmation? - Also, Confirm Shipment happened after Ship Goods? And after Issue Invoice? c) Case 1004: - Receive Payment before Invoice? * Maybe the customer paid in advance? But then why issue an invoice after? - Also, missing activities: Credit Check and Validate Stock? * Why? Maybe its a trusted customer? Or an error?"

And without shipping? - Also, the payment was received very quickly (5 minutes after order) and the order_value is 3000.00. Hypothesis: - This might be a test order? Or a fraudulent order? - Or perhaps a prepaid order? b) Case 1002: - Out-of-order: Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods before Credit Check. ... c) Case 1003: - Missing Validate Stock? - Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment? ... 10. Hypothesis 1: Some orders are missing critical activities (like credit check) because they are priority orders? Hypothesis 2: Some orders have out-of-order activities because of priority handling? Hypothesis 3: Payment received without an invoice might be due to prepaid orders? But then why issue an invoice after?"

Standard activities: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment Query to find cases missing at least one of these activities: WITH expected_activities AS ( SELECT unnest(ARRAY[Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment]) AS activity ), case_activities AS ( SELECT case_id, activity FROM order_event_log ) SELECT DISTINCT ca.case_id FROM (SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM order_event_log) ca CROSS JOIN expected_activities ea LEFT JOIN case_activities c   ON ca.case_id = c.case_id AND ea.activity = c.activity WHERE c.case_id IS NULL; b) Out-of-order activities: We can check the sequence of events. For example, we expect: Perform Credit Check to come before Ship Goods Validate Stock to come before Ship Goods Confirm Shipment to come before Ship Goods Issue Invoice to come before Receive Payment We can check for violations: Example: Check for cases where Ship Goods happens before Perform Credit Check: WITH events AS (   SELECT     case_id,     activity,     timestamp,     ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as event_order   FROM order_event_log ), credit_check AS (   SELECT case_id, timestamp as credit_check_time   FROM events   WHERE activity = Perform Credit Check ), ship_goods AS (   SELECT case_id, timestamp as ship_goods_time   FROM events   WHERE activity = Ship Goods ) SELECT s.case_id, s.ship_goods_time, c.credit_check_time FROM ship_goods s LEFT JOIN credit_check c ON s.case_id = c.case_id WHERE s.ship_goods_time < c.credit_check_time OR c.credit_check_time IS NULL; Similarly, for Ship Goods before Validate Stock: [similar query] And for Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment: [similar query] And for Receive Payment before Issue Invoice: [similar query] c) Additional investigations: - Check if priority orders (from orders table) are more likely to have out-of-order or missing steps: [query sketch] - Check if the same resource is doing activities in the wrong department?
