For C002, Call Customer happens twice where the first seems to be for clarify account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up call to confirm adjustments made. 3.

    "Text": "Justification for Naming Choices: 1. Verify Initial Documents vs. Verify Additional Documents (for C001): Verify Initial Documents is used for the first round of document verification where the agent checks the initially provided documents. Verify Additional Documents is used for the second round of verification where the agent checks the additional ID scan provided by the customer after the first round was incomplete. 2. Verify Initial Documents vs. Re-verify Documents After Adjustment (for C003): Verify Initial Documents is used for the first round of document verification where the BranchOfficer performs a physical verification of the ID. Re-verify Documents After Adjustment is used for the second round of verification which occurs after an account adjustment has been made, making it necessary to verify again after the Adjust Account event. 3. Call Customer activities have been renamed based on the specific context mentioned in the Additional Context column: For C001, Call Customer for Missing Docs makes it clear that the call is to request additional missing documents. For C002, Call Customer for Account Clarification makes it clear that the first call is to clarify a discrepancy in the account details, while Follow-up Call Customer after Account Adjustment makes it clear that the second call is a follow-up after an account adjustment has been made. For C003, Call Customer to Return to Branch makes it clear that the call is made because the customer stepped out and needs to return to continue the process."
