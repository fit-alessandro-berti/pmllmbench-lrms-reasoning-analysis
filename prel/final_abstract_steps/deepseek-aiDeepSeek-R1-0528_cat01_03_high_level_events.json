The retrieval, scanning (for traceability), placement, alignment, and preheating are all preparatory steps for the main assembly (welding). They are performed by both an operator and a robot arm, but they are logically connected as setup. - Welding: This group involves the actual joining of parts. The operator picks up the welding tool and performs the welds. This is the core value-adding step in the assembly. - Weld Quality Inspection: This is an in-process quality check to ensure the weld meets specifications. It is performed immediately after welding and before moving to the next stage (coating). This step ensures that if there is a problem, it can be caught early. - Coating Application: This group involves applying a protective layer and then drying it. This is a finishing step that protects the product and requires specific equipment (coating unit and heating unit for drying). - Final Quality Inspection: This is a final check by an operator to ensure the product meets all quality standards after all processing is complete. It is a common practice to have a final visual inspection."
