But their data doesnt strongly indicate it Alternatively, maybe the log provided doesnt include Packaging, but since we have to assign all events, perhaps event 10 is part of Quality Inspection, and Packaging isnt present here Alternatively, maybe event 10 is part of the Quality Inspection setup Since the problem requires assigning all events, perhaps event 10 is part of Weldings conclusion or transition, but not a separate activity In the explanation, Ill note that Packaging might not be clearly represented in this log, or its part of the idle phase after the last active steps"
