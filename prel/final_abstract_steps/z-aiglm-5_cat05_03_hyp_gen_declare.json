Maybe they meant You cannot close a claim while it is being evaluated (Mutual Exclusion in time not in trace) but DECLARE noncoexistence usually means within the same trace. Or maybe they meant You cannot evaluate a closed claim (sequence) but used the wrong constraint type. Why weak precedence? Maybe the modeler focused only on the start and end forgetting the middle. Business pressure? Fast-track closing claims without evaluation (fraud or efficiency gone wrong)."
