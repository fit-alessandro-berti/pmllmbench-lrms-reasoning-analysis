That makes sense because you can't close a claim before receiving it. But then there's the 'noncoexistence' entry for 'E' (Evaluate) which says its activities include 'C'. Wait, evaluating a claim and then closing it at the same time? That might not be logical."

The 'noncoexistence' for 'E' allows activity 'C', meaning that when evaluating, the only activity allowed is closing. That would mean that after evaluating, the claim is immediately closed. That might be an issue because typically evaluation leads to approval, not closing."
