So, in the coexistence constraint, map FinalDecision to ManualReview. But how to handle different decision outcomes? Maybe the coexistence is between any decision activity and ManualReview. But the example given in the problem mentions Approve_Minority or Reject_Minority, but the original model doesnt have those activities. Hmm, maybe the original models activities are generic, and we need to assume that there are specific decision activities for different outcomes. Or perhaps the existing FinalDecision is a generic activity, and we need to add constraints that apply when certain sensitive attributes are involved."

    "Text": "In conclusion, the steps I need to take are: 1. Identify where sensitive attributes might influence decisions. For example, if an applicants race is checked, and then a decision is made without a review, thats a bias. 2. Add new constraints that enforce that after checking sensitive attributes, a mitigation step (like BiasMitigationCheck) is required before a decision. 3. Add coexistence constraints to ensure that manual reviews are present when decisions are made for sensitive cases. 4. Add non-succession constraints to prevent direct succession from sensitive attribute checks to decisions."
