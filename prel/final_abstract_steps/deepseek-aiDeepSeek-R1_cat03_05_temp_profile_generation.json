The next step is to identify all possible pairs where the first activity precedes the second in at least one trace. For example, even if SS is followed by OP directly, we also need to consider SS followed by all subsequent activities like SSRC, SSQI, etc."

Or maybe after PT, there might be rework. However, the problem statement says that each execution involves those activities. So perhaps the process is linear: SS  OP  RC  QI  CA  PT  PK  WS  DT  AS. Therefore, the possible pairs are all (A,B) where A comes before B in this sequence."

Once the supplier is selected, placing the order might take a day or two for paperwork. So average could be 1 day (86400 seconds), with a standard deviation of a few hours, say 4 hours (14400 seconds)."

Let's say OP to RC takes 7 days (604800 seconds), stdev 2 days (172800). So total average is 1 day +7 days = 8 days (691200), stdev sqrt( (3600)^2 + (172800)^2 ), but that's if the times are independent."

So if in a trace the activities are SS, OP, RC, then for pair (SS, RC), the time is SS to OP (1 day) plus OP to RC (7 days) = 8 days. But if there are other activities in between, such as SS, X, OP, Y, RC, then the time from SS to RC would be the time from SS to RC's occurrence, regardless of intermediates."

    "Text": "Wait no. The example given is that all possible ordered pairs where the first comes before the second in the trace. But how is the time between them calculated? If the activities are non-consecutive, like A and C in <A,B,C>, the time between A and C could be the time from the end of A to the start of C (assuming B starts after A ends and C starts after B ends). So it would be the sum of A's duration (if any?), time between A and B, B's duration, and the time between B and C? Or is each activity considered as an instantaneous event? This is a bit ambiguous, but perhaps in this context, each activity is considered to have a timestamp (e.g., start or end time), and the time between two activities is the difference between their timestamps."
