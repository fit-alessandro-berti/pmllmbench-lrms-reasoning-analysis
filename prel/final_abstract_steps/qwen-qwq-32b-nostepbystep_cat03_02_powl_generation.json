The loop operator is defined as the loop between A and B (children A and B). So the loop_node is created as: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [bnc, dr]) Wait, the loop operators children are [A,B], where A is BNC and B is DR. Because the loop is defined as executing A (BNC), then either exit or execute B (DR) and then A again. So the loop_node is correct. The XOR between CD and MD is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and children CD and MD. xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [cd, md] The QA and SA are in a partial order where they can be done in any order.

But the first_part itself is a node (a partial order), so the first_part is a node in the roots nodes. Wait but also, the da_aci_partial_order is another node (the parallel DA and ACI). So thats correct. Wait but the loop_node is a loop operator node (OperatorPOWL), which is a node in the roots nodes. Then the xor_node is the choice between CD and MD (OperatorPOWL with operator XOR). Then, the qa_sa_partial_order is another partial order node, and then gla. This seems to work. But let me check the steps: The first_part (SR -> CS) comes first. Then, the da_aci comes next. Then the loop comes after that, then the xor, then the qa_sa_partial_order, then gla. Wait but what about the loop itself? The loop is the loop_node (OperatorPOWL), and that is a node in the roots nodes. Wait but the loop_nodes children are BNC and DR. The loop operator ensures that BNC is executed, then optionally DR and repeat. Now, lets also need to ensure that the loop_node comes after the da_aci_partial_order. So the roots order, after DA_ACI_PO comes the loop_node. Then after the loop_node, comes the xor_node (CD/MD choice). The xor_node is the next node in the roots nodes after the loop_node. Then, after the xor_node comes the qa_sa_partial_order node, which contains QA and SA in any order. Then, the gla comes after that. Now, lets code each part: First, the first_part: first_part is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes sr and cs, and an edge from sr to cs. Then, the da_aci_partial_order is a StrictPartialOrder with da and aci, no edges between them. loop_node is the loop operator between BNC and DR. So: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [bnc, dr]) Wait, the operator for LOOP is Operator.LOOP? Wait in the problems examples, the loop is represented as (A,B), so Operator.LOOP. Wait the import says Operator.XOR and Operator.LOOP. So the loop operator is Operator.LOOP. So code would be: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr]) Then, the XOR between CD and MD: xor_node = OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [cd, md]) QA and SA in any order: qa_sa_partial_order = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[qa, sa] The final step is gla, which must come after qa_sa. Now, the roots nodes are the components and the gla nodes = [ first_part, da_aci_partial_order, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa_partial_order, gla ] Then adding edges between them. Wait but the sequence is first_part da_aci loop_node xor_node qa_sa gla. Wait but after the xor_node comes qa_sa. Wait, after the xor_node (which is the deployment choice), CD or MD), the next step is the qa_sa_partial_order (QA and SA in any order). So the roots order edges are: root.order.add_edge(first_part, da_aci) root.order.add_edge(da_aci, loop_node) root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node) root.order.add_edge(xor_node, qa_sa) root.order.add_edge(qa_sa, gla) Wait but QA and SA must both be done before GLA, which is handled by the qa_sa_partial_order must be done before gla. Thus, the roots nodes are all the steps in order. Wait but the loop_node is a node between da_aci and xor_node. Wait the loop is after the da_aci_partial_order (the DA/ACI parallel step). Wait yes. Now, the only thing missing is that after the loop_node (BNC loop with DR), the next step is the xor_node (CD or MD). Now, the final part: Wait the QA and SA are done after the deployment choice (xor_node), so the xor_node must precede qa_sa_partial_order. Now, putting all these into the roots nodes and edges. Wait but in the code, the root is a StrictPartialOrder containing all these nodes. Now, also there any silent transitions needed? The problem didnt mention any silent transitions except where necessary, but in the example, sometimes silent transitions are used as options in Xors. But in this scenario, the only silent transitions may be needed if theres any hidden steps, but the problem doesnt mention any. So maybe no silent transitions are needed here. Now, putting it all into code. Lets try to write the code. Wait, but the qa and sa are part of qa_sa_partial_order, which is a node in the root. The gla is a Transition. Wait, but gla is a single transition, so it can be added as a node in the roots nodes. Wait yes, because nodes can be any POWL model, including transitions. Wait, the roots nodes are all the components: nodes = [first_part, da_aci, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa, gla] Wait but the qa_sa is the partial order between QA and SA, so the qa_sa node comes before gla. Now, in the roots nodes, the order edges are as I mentioned. Now, putting all this into code: Wait, code outline: Create all transitions sr = Transition(SR) cs = Transition(CS) da = Transition(DA) aci = Transition(ACI) bnc = Transition(BNC) dr = Transition(DR) cd = Transition(CD) md = Transition(MD) qa = Transition(QA) sa = Transition(SA) gla = Transition(GLA) First part: SR followed by CS first_part = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[sr, cs]) first_part.order.add_edge(sr, cs) DA and ACI in parallel da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[da, aci]) Loop between BNC and DR loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr]) Deployment choice (CD or MD) xor_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd, md]) QA and SA in any order qa_sa = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[qa, sa) The roots nodes are the components and the gla nodes = [ first_part, da_aci, loop_node, xor_node, qa_sa, gla ] root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=nodes) Add edges between nodes in order root.order.add_edge(first_part, da_aci) root.order.add_edge(da_aci, loop_node) root.order.add_edge(loop_node, xor_node) root.order.add_edge(xor_node, qa_sa) root.order.add_edge(qa_sa, gla) Wait, but wait the loop_node comes after da_aci.
