So in this case, the loop is BNC followed by optional D&R, but the loop is between BNC and D&R? Wait the description says the loop is between A and B. So the loop structure requires that after BNC (A), you can choose to exit or do D&R (B) and then repeat A (BNC). So the loop node is OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children [BNC, D&R].
