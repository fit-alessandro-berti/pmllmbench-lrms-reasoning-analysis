    "Text": "The model has 18 constraints across different types (existence, precedence, response, etc.), so I need to systematically break them down. I should group them logically rather than just listing them. Maybe start with the core workflow sequence, then quality/compliance rules, followed by financial controls, and finally the negative constraints that prevent violations."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The response should avoid technical jargon and focus on real-world implications. For each constraint, I'll explain what it means operationally, why it matters, and how it supports business or regulatory objectives. The tone should be professional but accessible, like explaining to a business analyst rather than a process mining expert."

    "Text": "I notice the Proceed_Without_Compliance activity is particularly important - that's clearly a regulatory red line. The financial steps (Transfer_Funds) also need careful handling due to monetary risks. The alt-response patterns suggest parallel notification processes, which is interesting for customer experience."

    "Text": "The challenge will be making this coherent without becoming too repetitive, since many constraints interrelate. I'll use concrete examples like credit checks and fund transfers to ground the explanations."
