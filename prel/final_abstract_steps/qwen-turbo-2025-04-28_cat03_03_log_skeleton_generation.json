    "Text": "Now, let's check if there are any other constraints. For example, the 'Never Together' could have some pairs. But without specific info, I think it's safe to leave it as empty. I need to verify if the 'always_before' and 'always_after' are correctly structured. For example, 'always_before' has (CA, RO) meaning that if CA occurs, then RO must have occurred before. Which is correct because CA must come after RO. Similarly, 'always_after' has (RO, CA) meaning that if RO occurs, then CA must be after. Which is also correct. So both sets are necessary. Another thing: the 'activ_freq' uses sets for the occurrence counts. The problem's example uses {'A': {0,1}, 'B': {1,2}}, so for each activity, the value is a set of allowed counts. Since all activities occur exactly once, each has {1}. I think that's the correct approach."
