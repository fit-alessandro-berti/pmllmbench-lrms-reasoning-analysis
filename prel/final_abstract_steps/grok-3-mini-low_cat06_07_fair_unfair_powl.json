Specifically: an XOR choice in the process: either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments. So, in POWL, that would be an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator between two sub-models: one for standard cultural fit, and one for community affiliation check."

From the description: Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding. So, probably: After ReceiveApplication, do a check, and if incomplete, loop back to request more info. In POWL, a loop is defined as * (A, B), where you execute A, then either exit or execute B then A again. To keep it simple, lets say: Have a sub-model for the loop: * (ParseResume, RequestMoreInfo)"

So, lets list the nodes: Common nodes: - ReceiveApplication: Transition(ReceiveApplication) - loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Transition(label=DataCheck), Transition(label=RequestMoreInfo)]) SkillAssessment = Transition(label=SkillAssessment)"

Yes! In the second model, its all applicants undergo the same cultural fit evaluation process, so cultural_node = Transition(label=CulturalFitCheck) And in the first, the XOR is between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck. I think that matches."
