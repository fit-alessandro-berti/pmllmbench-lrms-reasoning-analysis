    "Text": "First I need to analyze the existing process The current process has two paths Standard and Custom Each has validations and checks The user wants to reduce time and increase flexibility So where can automation be applied Maybe in validation tasks B1 B2 and parallel checks C1 C2 Also the approval steps F G might be automated using rules"
