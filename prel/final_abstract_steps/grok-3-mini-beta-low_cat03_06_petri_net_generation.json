The description says \"A customer files an Insurance Claim (C), after which the following steps take place:\", so perhaps the net starts with CR. To be precise, the initial marking is for a new claim arriving, so let's have a source place. Standard Petri net for processes often has a source place with a token. So, let's define places: - p_start: Initial place with a token. - Then, transition: CR (Claim Registration) - After CR, place: p_after_CR - From p_after_CR, transition: DV (Document Verification) - After DV, we have a choice: if documents are ok, go to FC; if not, go to RDS."

In Petri nets, we use separate places or transitions to model choices. A common way is to have the DV transition lead to a place, and from that place, arcs to different transitions based on conditions. But since Petri nets are for concurrency and sequences, for choices, we might need to model it with multiple outgoing arcs."

This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA).\" So, probably: After FC, if no doubts, go to CA; if doubts, go to II, and after II, back to FC.

Similarly for p5: token in p5 enables both t_CA and t_II. That's fine for this model."
