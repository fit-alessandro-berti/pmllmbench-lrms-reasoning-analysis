    "Text": "I need to consider realistic timeframes for each step in electronics manufacturing. Supplier selection might take days with high variance due to negotiations. Order placement to receiving components could be weeks with moderate variance depending on shipping. Quality inspection might be quick but with some variance due to potential issues. Assembly and testing could take days with moderate variance. Packaging and storage might be faster with low variance. Distribution could take days with high variance due to logistics. After-sales support would have the longest timeframe with high variance since it happens after sale."
