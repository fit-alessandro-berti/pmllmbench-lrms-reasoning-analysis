Otherwise we proceed. We can model the loop as: Loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo]) But note: the loop structure in POWL is (A, B) meaning: execute A then either exit or execute B and then A again. In our case: A: The initial check (which might lead to a request for more info or proceed) B: The request for more info (which then leads back to A) However note that after the request we must check again. So: A: CheckResume (which if complete we exit the loop; if not we do B and then A again) B: RequestMoreInfo So the loop node would be: loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo]) But note: the loop structure in POWL as defined in the example is such that after A we either exit (if condition met) or we do B and then A again. This matches: we do CheckResume to if complete we exit; if not we do RequestMoreInfo and then CheckResume again."

So the choice is exclusive. We model this as: xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]) Then after this XOR we proceed to the Managerial Review."
