Otherwise, we proceed. We can model the loop as: Loop = OperatorPOWL operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo] But note: the loop structure in POWL is * (A, B) meaning: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. In our case: A: CheckResume which if complete, we exit the loop; if not, we do B and then A again B: RequestMoreInfo So the loop node would be: loop_node = OperatorPOWL operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[CheckResume, RequestMoreInfo]"

So the choice is exclusive. We model this as: xor_cultural = OperatorPOWL operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck] Then after this XOR, we proceed to the Managerial Review."

But the problem only asks to produce the models. However, note: the problem says produce two POWL models, meaning we write the code to create them. Well write Python code using the pm4py library as in the example. But note: the example uses from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import ... and from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator Well do the same. Well create two functions or two separate code blocks for the two models. Since the problem does not require to run the code, we write the code that constructs the models. Lets write: Model 1: with potential unfairness"
