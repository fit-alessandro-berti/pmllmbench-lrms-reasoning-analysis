Maybe Region B has fewer resources, or the workflow is less efficient. Alternatively, there could be communication issues or higher workload in Region B.\n\n- Resource Efficiency: Adjuster_Lisa and Adjuster_Mike are involved in multiple requests.

Check if there are resource constraints, training issues, or process inefficiencies. Consider redistributing workload or providing additional support to Region B.\n\n3. Resource-Specific Training: If specific resources (like Adjuster_Lisa or Adjuster_Mike) are causing delays, provide targeted training or mentorship. Alternatively, reassign some of their workload to other resources if possible.\n\n4. Process Optimization: For cases requiring multiple document requests, implement a more efficient follow-up system. Maybe set time limits for how long a request can take before escalating to a manager, or use technology to track and manage document submissions more effectively."
