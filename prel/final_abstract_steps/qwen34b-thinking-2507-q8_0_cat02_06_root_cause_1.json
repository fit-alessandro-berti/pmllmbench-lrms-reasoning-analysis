Long investigation times: Case 104: Investigation starts at 13:00 on day 1 and ends at 08:00 on day 2 19 hours. 3. Unnecessary delays between activities: For example, in case 104, after assignment, the agent waited from 09:30 to 13:00 (3.5 hours) before starting investigation."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Proposed recommendations: 1. For escalation processes: Implement a clear SLA for Level-2 teams to start investigation within a certain time (e.g., 4 hours) after escalation. 2. For investigation times: Train Level-1 agents to handle more complex issues faster, or provide better tools to reduce investigation time. 3. For delays between activities: Reduce the time between assignment and investigation."
