Input: Transcripts from Mary (AP Clerk), Dan (Purchasing Officer), Carlos (Manager), Rita (Supervisor), and Karen (Supplier Relationship Manager). Required Elements: Activities/Tasks. Sequence Flow. Gateways/Decision Points. Roles/Participants. Artifacts/Inputs/Outputs. Exceptions/Variations. Guidance: Consolidate conflicts, indicate uncertainty, ensure clarity/logical coherence."
