This seems to be a loop that first executes A, and then we have a choice: either stop or do B and then A again. But note that the B is executed between the A's?

The silent step tau doesn't do anything, so it's effectively a no-op. Then we do RMI again. So the loop * (RMI, tau) would allow: - RMI (then exit) -> one RMI - RMI, then tau (so we do nothing), then RMI -> two RMI - RMI, tau, RMI, tau, RMI -> three RMI, etc."
