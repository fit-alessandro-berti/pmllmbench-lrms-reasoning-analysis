Because: - case sequences has each case id and its variant. - variant counts has the top K variants (and their count) - So joining case sequences with variant counts on variant would get all the cases that belong to those variants. - Then, joining event log with those case ids gives all events in those cases. This way, we can eliminate the need for the top cases CTE. So the query becomes: [Final Query Structure]. This should work.
