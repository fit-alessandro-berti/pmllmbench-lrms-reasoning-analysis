After that, Assembly (AS) and In-line Quality Check (IQC) seem to be involved in a loop because in some cases, AS and IQC repeat multiple times. For example, in Case 3, AS and IQC happen multiple times: AS, then IQC, then AS again, then IQC again, then AS again. Similarly, in Case 5, AS and IQC repeat."

In Case 3, after AS at 10:00, IQC at 10:15, then IQC again at 10:30 without AS in between? That doesn't make sense because IQC is an in-line check, so if it fails, we might need to rework AS, but if it passes, we proceed. But in the events, sometimes IQC is repeated consecutively without AS. For example, in Case 3: IQC at 10:15, then IQC at 10:30, then AS at 10:45. So after first IQC, instead of going to AS, another IQC happens? That might be an error in logging or perhaps IQC can be repeated without rework? But that seems odd."

So IQC was done, then rework AS, then TST without another IQC? In Case 2: AS at 10:10, IQC at 10:25, AS at 10:40, then TST at 11:10. So after the second AS, no IQC, directly TST. So IQC is not always done after AS; sometimes after AS, we go to TST directly."

    "Text": "This is messy. Let's think about the data differently. Perhaps AS and IQC are part of a subprocess that can be repeated. Each time after AS, IQC may be performed one or more times, but after IQC, if the product passes, we go to TST, but if not, we go back to AS. However, in the events, after IQC, we never go to TST; always after AS, we go to TST. So it seems that TST is always preceded by AS, not by IQC. So after IQC, we only go to AS or another IQC, and then after AS, we go to TST or IQC."

This matches the events where after AS, we sometimes go to TST, sometimes go to IQC, and after IQC, we go to AS again. In this loop, after IQC, we always go to AS, so we never have multiple IQCs without AS in between. But in the events, we have cases like Case 3 where after IQC, we have another IQC without AS in between. So this loop does not allow consecutive IQCs without AS."
