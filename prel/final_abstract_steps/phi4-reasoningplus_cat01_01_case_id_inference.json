Actually event #7 is for patient age=45 M in Radiology Xray imaging so it is already placed with case group 1 And event #12 is doctor consult for ER with diagnosis hairlinefracture for age=45 M So that is consistent Doublecheck: There are three unique patients identified by the combination of age and gender but also department seems to matter But note that sometimes a patient might have events across different departments For instance the 62F patient is in ER all along the 28M patient is in Surgery The 45M patient appears to be in ER and Radiology So grouping by these attributes gives us three separate cases"
