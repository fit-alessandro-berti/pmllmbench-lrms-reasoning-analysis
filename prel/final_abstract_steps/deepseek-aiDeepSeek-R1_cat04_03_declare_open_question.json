The 'coexistence' between 'Gather_Additional_Documents' (C) and 'Authorize_Contract_Terms' (F) means both must occur if either does. So, after gathering docs, authorization is needed, and vice versa? Maybe to ensure that authorization happens only after all docs are in."

Wait, no, altprecedence usually means that if H occurs, then G must have occurred before. But maybe in this model, it's structured differently. Need to clarify the exact semantics of altprecedence in DECLARE."

Or maybe the model has a typo, but according to the given data, chainsuccession for E to D would require that after E (QA), D (assemble package) happens next. But that seems backward. Unless there's a loop where after QA, they reassemble the package. Not sure. Need to think about that."

Since A is the initial step, G is much later, so this constraint might prevent processing a new application while funds are being transferred. Or maybe it's to prevent funds transfer before receiving the application, which is covered by other constraints. Wait, the 'noncoexistence' here is G and A can't both occur, but A is the first step. Maybe this is to prevent mixing different processes, but I'm not sure. Maybe it's a mistake, or it's to ensure that once funds are transferred, the application isn't received again in the same process instance."

The altprecedence between H and G might mean that notification must happen before transferring funds, but I need to check DECLARE semantics."

The constraints prevent skipping steps, ensure proper sequencing, and maintain auditability."
