The keys are 'equivalence', 'always_before', 'always_after', 'never_together', 'activ_freq', and 'directly_follows'. Each of these keys will have a set of pairs (tuples) indicating the allowed activities."

Looking back, the activities are: Receive Order (RO), Check Availability (CA), Reserve Items (RI), Pick Items (PI), Quality Check (QC), Pack Order (PO), Generate Shipping Label (GSL), Dispatch (D), Invoice Customer (IC), and Record Payment (RP)."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Starting with 'equivalence'. The equivalence constraint says that if the first activity occurs, it has the same occurrences as the second one. So I need pairs where the same activities are allowed. For example, (RO, RO), (CA, CA), etc."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next, 'always_before'. This means if the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed previously. So for any (A, B) pair, B must come before A. For example, (CA, RO) because CA happens before RO. Similarly, (RI, CA) because RI happens before CA."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "'Never Together' means the two activities cannot coexist inside the same case. So for any pair (A, B), they can't both be activities in the same case. So (A, B) and (B, A) would both be in the 'never_together' set."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "'Activ_freq' is a dictionary where each activity maps to a set of allowed occurrence counts. Since the constraints don't limit the number of occurrences (like not being together), each activity can occur 0 or 1 times, but in a case, each activity can only be in one case."
