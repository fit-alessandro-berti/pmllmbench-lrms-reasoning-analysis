Coexistence: If a decision (e.g., Approve, Reject) is made for an applicant belonging to a sensitive demographic (e.g., Minority), then there must be a ManualReview in the trace. However, note: The existing model does not have separate activities for decisions on minority applicants. We might need to introduce new activities? But the problem says to add constraints to the model, not necessarily to introduce new activities arbitrarily."

    "Text": "We have two options: a) Introduce new activities (like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck) and then add constraints. b) Use the existing activities and hope that the model already has activities for sensitive checks? But the example model does not. Since the example model does not have any activities for sensitive attributes, we must extend the model with new activities? However, the problem does not specify that we can add new activities. It only says to add constraints. But note: The problem says add new constraints, and constraints are based on activities. If we dont have the activities, we must add them? Actually, the problem says: You must introduce constraints that ensure that the sequence of activities does not discriminate .... This implies that we might need to assume the existence of certain activities."

    "Text": "We decide to do the following: b) Coexistence: We require that if a sensitive attribute is checked (any of them), then the trace must contain a ManualReview. This ensures that when sensitive attributes are considered, there is a manual review. c) Non-succession: We prevent the immediate succession from a sensitive check to the decision. But note: The coexistence constraint does not require the manual review to be in any particular order relative to the decision. It just requires that both occur. So its possible that the manual review occurs after the decision? That would be bad."

    "Text": "We can instead use a response constraint: the sensitive check must be responded by the manual review. But the response constraint requires that the manual review must occur at least once after the sensitive check? That would be good. So we change: Instead of coexistence, we use response for the manual review requirement. Therefore: response: { CheckApplicantRace: {ManualReview: ...}, ... } This ensures that after each sensitive check, there is at least one manual review."

We must also consider that the initial model does not have these new activities. We are adding them, but we must not violate the format. We just extend the constraints."
