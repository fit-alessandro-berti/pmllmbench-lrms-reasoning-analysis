We will assume that the following activities are present (or we add them for the constraints to work): - CheckApplicantRace: an activity that checks the race of the applicant. - CheckApplicantGender: an activity that checks the gender. - CheckApplicantAge: an activity that checks the age. - ManualReview: a manual review to ensure fairness. - BiasMitigationCheck: a specific check to mitigate bias."

But that is complex. Alternatively, we can use the response constraint: the sensitive check must be responded by the manual review. ... So we change: Instead of coexistence, we use response for the manual review requirement."

Non-succession constraints: For each sensitive attribute check, we prevent it from being immediately followed by the FinalDecision."
