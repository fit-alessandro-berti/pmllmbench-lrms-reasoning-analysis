    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Recommendations Investigate if escalation processes can be streamlined eg by having a dedicated team oncall for escalations or improving communication channels so that investigations can start earlier Identify and address waiting periods in the process For example ensure that once a ticket is assigned to an agent they have immediate access to the necessary information to begin investigation without delay Possibly automated routing or prioritization mechanisms could help reduce waiting times Ensure adequate resource allocation for Level1 and Level2 agents so that escalations do not cause significant delays Also consider whether certain tickets might be resolved by a single level if possible avoiding escalation if its not necessary Also consider potential human factors such as agent workload miscommunication between teams or technical issues causing delays in investigation step initiation Possibly improve training for triaging to reduce unnecessary waiting time before assignment Possibly recommending improvements to escalation process like reducing handover time ensuring Level2 agents have immediate availability or reevaluating the criteria for escalations could help reduce cycle times I can also mention that automation tools may help alert agents immediately once a ticket is assigned so they can start investigating sooner"
