The dictionary should map pairs of activities (as tuples) to a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation). The pairs are not just directly following activities but any that eventually follow each other in the process. For example, in a trace like <A,B,C,D>, pairs like (A,C) are included even though theyre not directly consecutive."

I need to think about realistic time gaps in a supply chain. Assume: SS to OP: often same day or next day. Avg 86400 s (1 day), std dev 43200 s (0.5 days). OP to RC: order to receive components. Supplier lead time, could be 1-2 weeks. Avg 10 days = 864000 s, std dev 2 days = 172800 s. RC to QI: receive to quality inspection. Probably quick, same day or next day. Avg 86400 s, std dev 43200 s. QI to CA: inspection to assembly. Might have some delay, avg 1 day, std dev 0.5 days. CA to PT: assembly to testing. Could be immediate or with delay, avg 1 day, std dev 0.5 days. PT to PK: testing to packaging. Quick, avg 0.5 days = 43200 s, std dev 21600 s. PK to WS: packaging to storage. Might be immediate, but WS is storage, so perhaps time to move to warehouse. Avg 0.1 days = 8640 s, std dev 4320 s. WS to DT: storage to distribution. Could vary, avg 3 days (e.g., waiting for batch), std dev 1 day. DT to AS: distribution to after-sales. AS might start after delivery, which could be days after DT. Avg 7 days (a week for initial support), std dev 2 days."
