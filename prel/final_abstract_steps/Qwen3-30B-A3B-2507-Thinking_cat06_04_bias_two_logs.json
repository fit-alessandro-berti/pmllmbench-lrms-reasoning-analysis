Thats suspicious. Let me verify: Group A (Protected): All cases have None for CommunityGroup, and ScoreAdjustment is always 0 or N/A. Final decisions: P001 Approved (720), P002 Rejected (710), P003 Approved (740). Group B (Unprotected): Cases with CommunityGroup (Highland Civic Darts Club) get +10 adjustment (U001: 720730, U003: 695705), while cases without it (U002) get no adjustment (710710)."

But heres the bias: Group B with CommunityGroup gets a boost to pass (U001: 720730 Approved; U003: 695705 Approved), while Group A with identical base scores (e.g., P001s 720) gets approved without boost, but P002s 710 gets rejected.

    "Text": "This suggests the system is adding a positive adjustment for Group B members who are in a community group, but never for Group A. Since Group A is labeled Protected, this bias is likely discriminatoryits giving extra points to the unprotected group (Group B) based on community affiliation, which might correlate with protected status, but the log doesnt say that. Waitactually, Group A is Protected, so they should be protected from bias. But here, theyre getting no boost, while Group B (unprotected) gets a boost. That means Group A is at a disadvantage when their scores are near the threshold (e.g., 710 rejected vs. Group Bs 710 also rejected, but Group Bs 720 gets boosted to pass)."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The bias manifests as: Protected Group (A) never receives score adjustments, even for similar scores. Unprotected Group (B) receives a +10 boost only when they have a community group, making them more likely to pass at lower base scores (e.g., 695 705 Approved vs. Group As 710 Rejected). This creates a systematic advantage for Group B when theyre in a community group, but Group Adespite possibly having similar scoresgets no such advantage. Since Group A is the protected group, this is problematic. The bias isnt just in the adjustment; its in the exclusion of the protected group from the adjustment."

    "Text": "Also, note that Group As CommunityGroup is always None, which might reflect that theyre not part of such groups (or the system doesnt allow it), but the log doesnt say why. The bias is in the policy: the adjustment is applied only to Group B, not to Group A."

The pattern shows Group B gets a safety net via community boost, while Group A doesnt. Thats the bias."
