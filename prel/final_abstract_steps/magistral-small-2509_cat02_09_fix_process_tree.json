No, because pay comes after match, which comes after parallel block, which includes receive goods. - Can we receive goods before creating PO? No, because create PO comes before the parallel block. - Can we match invoice before receiving invoice? No, because match comes after parallel block which includes receive invoice. So this seems correct."
