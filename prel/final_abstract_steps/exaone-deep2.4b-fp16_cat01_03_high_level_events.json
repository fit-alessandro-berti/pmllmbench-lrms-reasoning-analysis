    "Text": "Looking at the first case (A1), the events start with retrieving the raw metal sheet, scanning the barcode, placing it on the table, aligning with the robot, preheating, then moving on to welding with Operator B, measuring weld integrity, applying coating, drying it, and finally a visual check. Similarly for B2, the process seems almost identical except maybe some minor differences in the order or some data points."

    "Text": "First, I need to identify patterns. Let's note the common steps across both cases. The initial steps for both are material handling: retrieving the raw metal, scanning the barcode, placing on the table, aligning with the robot, preheating. Then comes the welding phase (with Operator B), followed by quality checks like measuring weld integrity, coating application, drying, and the final visual check. So maybe the high-level steps are: 1. Material Preparation: includes getting the raw material, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating; 2. Welding: the actual welding of parts; 3. Quality Assurance: after welding, there are checks like weld integrity measurement, coating application."

    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe the steps after welding are part of the quality assurance and final processing steps. Let me try to outline possible high-level steps: Material Handling (including retrieval, scanning, placement, alignment, preheating), Welding Process (involves picking up the tool, welding steps), and Post-Welding Quality Checks (measuring weld integrity, applying coating, drying, and final visual inspection)."

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe the coating is done earlier, as part of material preparation? But checking again, it is applied after welding in the log, so it must belong to the final processing steps. This aligns with the sequence: welding, then quality checks (weld inspection), coating, and final validation."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Ensuring the proposed steps align with the event log: Material Preparation includes all actions up to preheating; Welding covers all tool handling and assembly actions; immediate weld checks belong to Post-Weld Quality Check; Coating and Drying are subsequent processing steps; and the Visual Check wraps everything up in Final Inspection. Both A1 and B2 follow this consistent pattern, supporting the proposed groupings."

    "Text": "The task specifies that each high-level step should represent a coherent stage. From the event sequence, applying coating and drying logically aligns as part of a single continuous process. Separating it into its own activity stage helps align with the manufacturing workflow structure, rather than merging it into Quality Assurance."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Alternatively, could Final Inspection include the drying step? Drying precedes the visual inspection in the log, so grouping them separately reflects a clearer, sequential structure."
