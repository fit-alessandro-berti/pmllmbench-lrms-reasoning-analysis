    "Text": "First, I'll start by identifying the key steps in the process. From the interviews, the process begins when an invoice arrives. Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk, checks for a valid purchase order number. If it's missing, she sends it back to the supplier. If it has a PO, she logs it, then sends it to Purchasing for confirmation. After that, she matches the invoice to the PO and sends it to the manager for approval. If there are discrepancies, she handles them by contacting Purchasing or escalating to her supervisor. Once approved, it's scheduled for payment."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Then, Dan, the Purchasing Officer, receives the invoice from AP and checks against the PO. He looks for quantity, price, and delivery charges mismatches. If there's an issue, he contacts the supplier or asks AP to hold the invoice. Once everything's correct, he confirms it, and it goes to the manager for approval."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Carlos, the Department Manager, is one of the last to approve. He checks quantities, pricing, and budget compliance. If something's off, he might reject it or ask for further investigation. His approval is a final step before it goes back to AP for payment."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Rita, the AP Supervisor, deals with exceptions. She steps in when there are issues Mary can't resolve, like missing info or discrepancies. She works with suppliers and departments to resolve these, then the invoice moves back into the normal flow for manager approval and payment."

    "Text": "Starting with the Invoice Arrival. Mary receives it via email. Then she checks for PO number. If no PO, she sends back to supplier. If yes, she logs it. Then to Purchasing for confirmation. She matches the invoice, sends to manager. If discrepancies, she handles them, and escalates if needed. After approval, it's scheduled for payment."
