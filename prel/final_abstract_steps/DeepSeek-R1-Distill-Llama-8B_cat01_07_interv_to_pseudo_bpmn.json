    "Text": "First, I'll start by identifying the key steps in the process. From the interviews, the process begins when an invoice arrives. Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk, checks for a valid purchase order number. If it's missing, she sends it back to the supplier. If it has a PO, she logs it, then sends it to Purchasing for confirmation. After that, she matches the invoice to the PO and sends it to the manager for approval. If there are discrepancies, she handles them by contacting Purchasing or escalating to her supervisor. Once approved, it's scheduled for payment."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then, Dan, the Purchasing Officer, receives the invoice from AP and checks against the PO. He looks for quantity, price, and delivery charges mismatches. If there's an issue, he contacts the supplier or asks AP to hold the invoice. Once everything's correct, he confirms it, and it goes to the manager for approval."
