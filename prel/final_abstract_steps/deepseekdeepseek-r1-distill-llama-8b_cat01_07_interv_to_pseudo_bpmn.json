    "Text": "First, Ill start by identifying the key steps in the process. From the interviews, the process begins when an invoice arrives. Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk, checks for a valid purchase order number. If its missing, she sends it back to the supplier. If it has a PO, she logs it, then sends it to Purchasing for confirmation. After that, she matches the invoice to the PO and sends it to the manager for approval. If there are discrepancies, she handles them by contacting Purchasing or escalating to her supervisor. Once approved, its scheduled for payment."

    "Text": "Then, Dan, the Purchasing Officer, receives the invoice from AP and checks against the PO. He looks for quantity, price, and delivery charges mismatches. If theres an issue, he contacts the supplier or asks AP to hold the invoice. Once everythings correct, he confirms it, and it goes to the manager for approval."

    "Text": "Carlos, the Department Manager, is one of the last to approve. He checks quantities, pricing, and budget compliance. If somethings off, he might reject it or ask for further investigation. His approval is a final step before it goes back to AP for payment."

    "Text": "Rita, the AP Supervisor, deals with exceptions. She steps in when there are issues Mary cant resolve, like missing info or discrepancies. She works with suppliers and departments to resolve these, then the invoice moves back into the normal flow for manager approval and payment."
