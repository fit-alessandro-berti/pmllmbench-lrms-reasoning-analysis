All Parallel Checks Completed Join: This is the convergence point of the parallel tasks C1 and C2. Once both checks are done, the flow proceeds. 7.

The condition might be based on the order value, customer history, or other business rules. - If Yes: Proceeds to Task F. - If No: Skips approval and goes directly to generating the final invoice Task G. 9. Task F: Obtain Manager Approval: If approval is needed, the process sends the order for manager approval. 10.

This might involve adjusting the order, pricing, or other terms. - Loop back: - For a custom request, the loop back goes to Task E1 Prepare Custom Quotation. This implies that after re-evaluation, a new quotation might be prepared and the process from E1 onward is repeated including the approval step again if needed. - For a standard request, the loop back goes to Task D Calculate Delivery Date. This implies that after re-evaluation, the delivery date might be recalculated and then the process from D onward is repeated, including the approval step if needed. Note: The loop back is conditional on the request type. The process must remember the request type to determine where to loop back. 12. Task G: Generate Final Invoice: This task generates the final invoice. It is reached in two scenarios: - If no approval was needed bypassing Task F. - If approval was granted after Task F. 13. Task I: Send Confirmation to Customer: After generating the final invoice, a confirmation is sent to the customer. 14. End Event: The process ends."

    "Text": "Key Points: - Gateways: - XOR Exclusive Gateway: Only one outgoing path is taken based on conditions. - AND Inclusive Gateway: All outgoing paths are taken in parallel, and the flow waits until all are completed. - Loop Back: The loop back after a denied approval Task H is to the appropriate step based on the request type. This is a form of iteration until approval is granted or the request is abandoned though the process as described doesnt show an abandonment path; it loops until approval is granted. - Differences based on request type: - Standard Path: Involves parallel checks credit and inventory and then delivery date calculation. - Custom Path: Involves feasibility analysis and then preparation of a custom quotation if feasible or rejection if not. The custom path does not have the parallel checks. - Approval Trigger: Approval is triggered based on a condition e.g., order value, customer risk, etc. that is checked at the Is Approval Needed? gateway. If approval is denied, the process loops back to either the quotation step for custom or the delivery date calculation for standard for re-evaluation. This implies that the re-evaluation might lead to changes that could then require re-approval."

    "Text": "Process Summary: The business process handles customer requests by first determining if they are standard or custom. - For standard requests, it performs validation and parallel checks credit and inventory, then calculates the delivery date. - For custom requests, it checks feasibility and either prepares a quotation or rejects the request. After these steps, the process checks if approval is needed. If approval is needed and granted, it generates an invoice. If approval is denied, it loops back to the appropriate step quotation for custom, delivery date for standard for re-evaluation. Finally, after generating the invoice, it sends a confirmation to the customer. This process ensures that orders are processed efficiently, with appropriate checks and balances, and that custom orders are handled with feasibility analysis and quotations. The loop back mechanism allows for iterative improvement until approval is obtained or the request is eventually rejected though the process doesnt specify a maximum number of loops or an abandonment path, which might be a gap in the design. Note: The pseudo-BPMN does not specify how the loop back condition request type is maintained. In a real BPMN, we might use a process variable to track the request type and use it in the gateway conditions and loop back targets."
