After that, if inventory is sufficient, it proceeds to Authorize payment, then Package items, Ship order, and finally Close order. If inventory is insufficient, it goes to Cancel order and then directly to Close order."

The process should check inventory before authorizing payment or packaging. Here, they're packaging before authorizing payment, and they skipped the Authorize payment step before packaging. So, this violates the process because Package items should only come after Authorize payment."

That's not allowed. The description says after cancellation, they should close the order and not proceed with shipping. So shipping after cancellation is a violation."
