Activities involved: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS (10 activities) 2. The temporal profile should include pairs of activities that eventually follow each other (not just directly connected) 3. For each pair, provide (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds 4. Should include pairs separated by multiple steps (not just consecutive) 5. Dont provide explicit numerical temporal information in the explanation, but the LLM should estimate realistic times 6. Should be a representative subset (not necessarily all pairs, but enough to show complexity)"
