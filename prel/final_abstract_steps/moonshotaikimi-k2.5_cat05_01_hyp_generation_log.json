    "Text": "Let me structure the response: 1. Anomaly Analysis (case by case) 2. Hypotheses (why these happen) 3. SQL Investigation Queries (to validate hypotheses) I should write the SQL for PostgreSQL specifically since thats the database type. ... Final check: The user wants the LLM to identify anomalies, hypothesize why, and propose SQL queries without hints. So I should present this as if Im discovering these patterns myself. Structure: 1. Executive Summary of Findings 2. Detailed Anomaly Analysis (by case and pattern type) 3. Root Cause Hypotheses 4. Investigative SQL Queries (with explanations of what they find) This looks complete."
