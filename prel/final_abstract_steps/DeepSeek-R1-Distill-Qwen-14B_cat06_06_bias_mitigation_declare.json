This would go under 'non-succession', adding a pair where 'CheckApplicantRace' cannot be succeeded by 'Reject'.\n\n3. Response Constraint: Ensure that after 'CheckApplicantRace', a 'BiasMitigationCheck' must happen before any decision. But wait, response constraints are about what must follow.

The existing model doesn't have 'Approve_Minority' or 'Reject_Minority', so I might need to assume these are part of the model or adjust accordingly. Alternatively, perhaps the sensitive decisions are just 'Approve' and 'Reject' but with conditions based on attributes. But in the model, the activities are just 'Approve', 'Reject', etc., without attribute conditions. Hmm, this might be a point of confusion. Maybe the model should have specific activities for sensitive decisions, but since the example doesn't include them, perhaps I need to adjust my approach."

So each key in 'coexistence' is a source activity, and the value is a dict of target activities that must coexist.\n\nSo, for example, if 'Approve_Minority' occurs, 'ManualReview' must also occur.\n\nSecond, under 'non-succession', I'll add that 'CheckApplicantRace' cannot be succeeded by 'Reject' without an intervening step.\n\nSo in 'nonsuccession', I'll add:\n\n\"CheckApplicantRace\": {\"Reject\": {\"support\": 1.0, \"confidence\": 1.0}},\n\nThis means that after 'CheckApplicantRace', 'Reject' cannot come directly.\n\nThird, under 'response', I'll add that after 'CheckApplicantRace', 'BiasMitigationCheck' must respond.
