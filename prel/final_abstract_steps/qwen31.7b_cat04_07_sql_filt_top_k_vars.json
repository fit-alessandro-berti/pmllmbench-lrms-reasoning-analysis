The goal is to find process variants, count them, and then return only the events from the top K variants. First, I need to understand the requirements. A process variant is the ordered sequence of activities in a case, ordered by timestamp. So, for each case_id, we need to get the ordered list of activities. Then, group these sequences and count how many cases each variant has. Finally, select the top K variants by frequency and return the events from those cases."
