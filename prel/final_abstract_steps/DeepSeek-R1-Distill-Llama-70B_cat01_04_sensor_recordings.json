    "Text": "Starting with Event 1: Timestamp is 8:00:00, Machine M1. The readings are all pretty low—temperature is 20°C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0 Hz, material flow 0, tool position 0, and energy 0.5 kWh. Event 2 is similar, just a slight dip in energy. Event 3 is also similar, with a tiny increase in temperature to 21°C but everything else still low. So these first three events seem like the machine is either idle or just starting up, maybe in a standby mode. I'll call this 'Machine Startup/Idle' for now."

    "Text": "Then Event 4: Temperature jumps to 50°C, pressure stays the same, vibration goes up to 30 Hz, material flow is 5 units/s, tool position moves to 5 mm, and energy spikes to 2.0 kWh. This is a significant change from the previous events. The temperature rise, increased vibration, and material flow starting up suggests that the machine is now active. Maybe it's starting to cut something. Events 5 and 6 follow with temperature increasing further to 58°C, vibration up to 38 Hz, material flow steady at 5, tool position moving to 10 mm, and energy going up to 3.0 kWh."

    "Text": "So these three events (4,5,6) seem to be part of the same activity, which I'll tentatively label as 'Cutting Metal' because of the high temperature, vibration, and material flow."

    "Text": "Moving on to Event 7: Temperature drops to 40°C, pressure goes up to 2 bar, vibration is 10 Hz, material flow is 2 units/s, tool position is 15 mm, and energy is back to 2.0 kWh. Event 8 is almost identical to Event 7. This seems like a different phase. The lower temperature than the cutting phase, but higher pressure and some vibration. Maybe this is a different operation, like assembling parts where pressure is applied. So I'll label Events 7 and 8 as 'Assembling Parts'."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Event 9 is next: Temperature soars to 80°C, pressure stays at 2 bar, vibration jumps to 50 Hz, material flow drops to 0, tool position is still at 15 mm, and energy consumption is 5.0 kWh. High temperature and vibration with no material flow. This could be a welding operation where heat is applied without moving material."

This seems like a cooldown phase, maybe a quality inspection after welding where the machine isn't doing anything heavy. Events 11 and 12 follow with similar low readings but with a slight increase in vibration and material flow. Maybe the machine is preparing for the next cycle or being adjusted. So I'll label Events 10,11,12 as 'Quality Inspection/Adjustment'."

    "Text": "Finally, Events 13,14,15 are similar to the first three, with low readings. It looks like the machine is returning to an idle state after the process is done. So I'll group these as 'Machine Shutdown/Idle'."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think each phase is determined by significant changes in temperature, vibration, and material flow. For example, cutting involved high heat and vibration, while welding was even hotter but without material flow. Assembling had higher pressure, and quality inspection had lower energy use. This makes sense for a manufacturing process flow."
