So the SWITCH event itself might be part of the previous case (Email) but the next events are part of the new case (PDF). However, in process mining, each event is part of a case. So the SWITCH event is part of the case that was active before the switch. But when the user switches applications, the new case starts. This complicates things. How to handle SWITCH events that transition between cases. For example, the SWITCH event at 09:04:00 is from Email - Inbox (case Email - Inbox) to Adobe Acrobat (case Report_Draft.pdf). So this event belongs to the Email - Inbox case, but the subsequent events (SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT) belong to Report_Draft.pdf. So the SWITCH event is part of the previous case, and the next events are part of the new case. Thus, the event log would have: Event 12: SWITCH, Case ID Email - Inbox Then, events 13 and 14 belong to Report_Draft.pdf. So, for the SWITCH event, the case ID is the one before the switch. Therefore, the SWITCH event is part of the previous case."

    "Text": "Now, compiling all these into the event log table. Also, need to check for any missing cases. For example, the first FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50.000Z is part of the Quarterly_Report.docx case. Then, after closing it at 09:08:15, the user might have other activities, but in the given log, thats the end. Now, the explanation: The cases were grouped based on the document or application being interacted with. Each document (e.g., Document1.docx, Email - Inbox, Report_Draft.pdf, Budget_2024.xlsx, Quarterly_Report.docx) was treated as a separate case. Activities were standardized to higher-level actions like Edit Document, Save Document, Switch Application, etc., to ensure consistency and clarity for process mining analysis. For example, the FOCUS events were mapped to Switch Application as they indicate transitioning between applications or documents. TYPING was translated to Edit Document since it represents content creation. SAVE became Save Document, and so on. The case IDs were derived from the window titles to uniquely identify each logical work unit."
