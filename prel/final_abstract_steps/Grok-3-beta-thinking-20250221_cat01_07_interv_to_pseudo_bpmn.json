I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges.\"\n\nThis seems inconsistent.\n\nWait, perhaps Purchasing does both: confirms receipt and checks the invoice details.\n\nBut in standard processes, often Purchasing confirms receipt, and AP matches the invoice to PO and receipt.\n\nLet me see.\n\nActually, in many organizations, there's a three-way match: invoice, PO, and receiving document.\n\nSo, probably, Purchasing confirms that the goods were received (i.e., provides the receiving document), and then AP matches the invoice to the PO and the receiving document.\n\nSo, it seems that Purchasing confirms receipt, and AP matches invoice to PO, assuming that receipt confirmation implies that quantities match.\n\nBut Dan mentions checking quantities and prices, which suggests he might be doing more than just confirming receipt.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps in this process, Purchasing does the full check.\n\nBut to reconcile, maybe Purchasing checks the invoice against the PO and confirms if it matches, including both receipt and details.\n\nThen, AP might do a final verification before sending to manager.\n\nBut in Carlos's interview, he says: \"Once the invoice has been matched to a PO and Dan confirms that everything is okay, I get a notification.\"\n\nSo, it seems that Dan confirms that everything is okay, meaning the invoice matches the PO and receipt.\n\nThen, AP might not need to do another match.\n\nWait, but Mary says she matches after getting confirmation.\n\nPerhaps it's a bit redundant, but let's assume that Purchasing confirms receipt and checks the invoice, then AP does a final match or verification before sending to manager.\n\nAlternatively, maybe \"matching\" by AP is more about entering the data into the system for payment processing.\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume that Purchasing checks the invoice against PO and confirms receipt, then sends confirmation to AP, and AP proceeds to send to manager for approval, perhaps after some internal processing."
