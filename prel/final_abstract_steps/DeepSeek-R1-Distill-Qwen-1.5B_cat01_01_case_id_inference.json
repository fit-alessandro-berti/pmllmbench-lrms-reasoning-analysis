    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I checked whether inferred groupings align with healthcare workflows by ordering events chronologically and analyzing overlaps. For example, if activities like 'Triage' and 'Doctor Consultation' reference the same patient and department, they are part of the same case."
