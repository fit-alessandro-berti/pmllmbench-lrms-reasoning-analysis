    "Text": "Okay, let me tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to thoroughly understand the normative process described so I can compare each case against it. The normative process has two possible paths depending on inventory check results. Let me outline the correct paths first: Normal Path (Inventory Sufficient): 1. Receive order 2. Check inventory 3. Authorize payment 4. Package items 5. Ship order 6. Close order Insufficient Inventory Path: 1. Receive order 2. Check inventory 3. Cancel order 4. Close order Important constraints mentioned: - Authorize payment must come after Check inventory and before Package items. - Package items must come after authorization and before shipping. - Ship order cant happen after a cancellation. - Close order is the final activity in all cases."

    "Text": "Now, Ill go through each case one by one and check for deviations. Case 1: Activities in order: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close. This matches the normal path perfectly. So no issues here."

    "Text": "Case 2: Timeline: Receive, Check, then Package, then Authorize, then Ship, Close. Wait, heres a problem. The process requires Authorize payment before Package items, but here they packaged before authorizing. Thats a clear violation. Also, the correct sequence after Check is Authorize first. So this case is violating the order between Authorize and Package."

    "Text": "Case 3: Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Hmm. After checking inventory, they authorized payment, then canceled. But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, the next step after Check should be Cancel, skipping Authorize. Here, they did Authorize even though they ended up canceling. Thats a problem. Also, after Cancel, they proceeded to Ship, which is not allowed. Because once you cancel, you cant ship. So two violations here: Authorizing after insufficient inventory (if Check led to Cancel, then Authorize shouldnt have happened) and Shipping after Cancel. Wait, but how do we know if the inventory was sufficient or not in Case 3? The process says if inventory is insufficient, go to Cancel. So in Case 3, since they did Cancel, that implies inventory was insufficient. Therefore, they shouldnt have done Authorize Payment at all in that case. Thats another violation."

    "Text": "Case 4: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. Thats exactly the insufficient path. No issues here."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 5: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, after Authorize, they skipped packaging. The normative process requires Package items after Authorize and before Ship. So here, they went straight from Authorize to Ship without Packaging. Thats a violation. Also, Close comes after Ship, which is okay, but missing the Packaging step entirely is a problem. Additionally, in the normal path, Ship must come after Packaging. So skipping Packaging and going straight to Ship is wrong. Also, in the insufficient path, if they had canceled, but since they went to Authorize, that implies inventory was sufficient, so they should have packaged first."

    "Text": "So, all cases except 1 and 4 have issues. Let me confirm each again: Case 2: The key issue is the order of Authorize and Package. They did Package before Authorize, which violates the required order. Case 3: Three issues: - Authorizing payment after the inventory check, but since they canceled, that authorization shouldnt have happened. - Shipping after cancellation, which is forbidden. - Cancel comes after Authorize, but according to process, after Check, if insufficient, you must Cancel immediately. So Authorize shouldnt have occurred in that path. Case 5: Missing the Package step between Authorize and Ship. So violating the required sequence. So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Case 1 and 4 are correct. Now, I need to explain each violation clearly based on the normative description."
