But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, the next step after Check should be Cancel, skipping Authorize. Here, they did Authorize even though they ended up canceling. That's a problem. Also, after Cancel, they proceeded to Ship, which is not allowed. Because once you cancel, you can't ship. So two violations here: Authorizing after insufficient inventory (if Check led to Cancel, then Authorize shouldn't have happened) and Shipping after Cancel."

    "Text": "Wait, but how do we know if the inventory was sufficient or not in Case 3? The process says if inventory is insufficient, go to Cancel. So in Case 3, since they did Cancel, that implies inventory was insufficient. Therefore, they shouldn't have done Authorize Payment at all in that case. That's another violation."

    "Text": "Case 5:\nSequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close.\n\nWait, after Authorize, they skipped packaging. The normative process requires Package items after Authorize and before Ship. So here, they went straight from Authorize to Ship without Packaging. That's a violation. Also, Close comes after Ship, which is okay, but missing the Packaging step entirely is a problem. Additionally, in the normal path, Ship must come after Packaging. So skipping Packaging and going straight to Ship is wrong. Also, in the insufficient path, if they had canceled, but since they went to Authorize, that implies inventory was sufficient, so they should have packaged first."

    "Text": "So, all cases except 1 and 4 have issues. Let me confirm each again:\n\nCase 2: The key issue is the order of Authorize and Package. They did Package before Authorize, which violates the required order.\n\nCase 3: Three issues: \n- Authorizing payment after the inventory check, but since they canceled, that authorization shouldn't have happened.\n- Shipping after cancellation, which is forbidden.\n- Cancel comes after Authorize, but according to process, after Check, if insufficient, you must Cancel immediately. So Authorize shouldn't have occurred in that path.\n\nCase 5: Missing the Package step between Authorize and Ship. So violating the required sequence.\n\nSo the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Case 1 and 4 are correct."
