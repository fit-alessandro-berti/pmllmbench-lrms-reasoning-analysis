But if RDS is needed, then after DV, you have to go to RDS, then back to DV again? Or maybe after RDS, you proceed to FC. Hmm, the problem says that RDS occurs before proceeding to FC. So maybe after DV, you have a loop where you can go to RDS, then back to DV, and repeat until documents are complete. Then, after RDS, you proceed to FC. But how to model this in Petri net."

Define transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, Closed. 4. Connect the transitions with arcs according to the flow."
