The process must follow the exact order: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] Close Case. Also, there are ordering rules that cant be violated. For example, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and if the loan is rejected, Finalize Documentation shouldnt happen."

This seems to follow all the steps in order. No skips, no reversals. The finalization is after approval, which is correct. So Case 1 is compliant with normative rules."

The desiderata says Credit Check should be within 24 hours, so this is a violation of the desiderata. Then Risk Assessment at 11:00 same day, Loan Decision approved at 12:00. Inform Applicant at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, which is 48 hours after the decision (since decision was at 12:00 on 14th, inform at 15:00 on 16th is 48 hours later). The desiderata says inform within 48 hours, so this is a violation. Also, theres no Follow-up Call, which is a desiderata. So Case 3 violates the desiderata for Credit Check timing, Inform Applicant timing, and missing Follow-up Call."

Case 1: Credit Check was done at 09:30, which is 30 minutes after application. Thats within 24 hours, so okay. Inform Applicant at 13:00, which is 4 hours after the decision (11:00 to 13:00). The desiderata says within 48 hours, so thats okay. Also, theres no mention of a Follow-up Call, but the desiderata says its encouraged but not required. So Case 1 meets all desiderata."

But the Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check, which is a normative violation, but for desiderata, maybe the timing is okay. However, the problem is that the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative issue. But for desiderata, maybe the timing of Credit Check is okay. However, the main issue here is the normative violation. For desiderata, maybe the Credit Check timing is okay, but the main problem is the order. But the desiderata is about timing and follow-up. So in Case 2, the Credit Check was done at 09:00, which is within 24 hours. The Inform Applicant is at 10:00, which is 1 hour after the decision (9:30 to 10:00). Thats within 48 hours. But theres no Follow-up Call. So Case 2 violates the desiderata for not having a Follow-up Call. But the main issue is the normative violations."

So thats a desiderata violation. Inform Applicant was at 15:00 on 16th, which is 48 hours after the decision (12:00 on 14th to 15:00 on 16th is 48h3h). So thats a violation. Also, no Follow-up Call.

    "Text": "Now, for the explanations: For Case 2, the normative violations are: 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (ordering rule violation). 2. Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradicts the rule that if rejected, dont finalize). For Case 3, the desiderata violations are: 1. Credit Check took more than 24 hours (from 09:00 on 12th to 10:00 on 14th is 49 hours). 2. Inform Applicant took more than 48 hours (from 12:00 on 14th to 15:00 on 16th is 48h3h). 3. No Follow-up Call. But the user might want to clarify that these are not severe, just suboptimal. For interpretations, maybe in Case 2, the Credit Check was delayed, but the Risk Assessment was done first. Maybe there was a mistake in the process. For Case 3, the delays might be due to resource constraints or other factors, but they still violate the recommendations."

    "Text": "I need to make sure I didnt miss any other violations. For example, in Case 2, after the loan is rejected, they did Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. Thats a normative violation. Also, the order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment is wrong. So summarizing: Case 1: No normative violations. Meets all desiderata. Case 2: Normative violations (order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment, Finalize after rejection). Desiderata: no Follow-up Call. Case 3: No normative violations (sequence is correct). Desiderata violations: Credit Check timing, Inform Applicant timing, no Follow-up Call. Wait, but in Case 3, the Credit Check was done 49 hours after application, which is more than 24. The desiderata says within 24 hours, so thats a violation. Similarly, Inform Applicant was 48h3h, which is over 48. So those are desiderata violations. And no Follow-up Call. So the answer should list these points."
