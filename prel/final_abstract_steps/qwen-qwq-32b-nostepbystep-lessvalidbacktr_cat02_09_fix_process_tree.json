So in the current model, the sequence is create_req -> approve_req, then the parallel block includes create_po as one of the parallel children? That can't be right. Wait, the code says: The parallel_block is a ProcessTree with operator PARALLEL, and children are create_po, receive_goods, etc. So the create_po is part of the parallel's children, meaning that after approving the requisition, the system allows creating the PO in parallel with the other steps. That's wrong. The Create PO should come immediately after approval, and only after that can the other steps proceed."

So in the current model, the create_po is part of the parallel block, meaning that after the first two steps, all the parallel children (including create_po) can be done in any order.
