The columns needed are case ID (order_id), activity name like Order Created, timestamp which is order_date, resource/actor could be sales_person_id if we have that in the Resources table."

But each row in the Order Lines table represents a picking event by picker_id, so maybe each items pickup from inventory should create an event. However, some orders have multiple items picked on the same date but different times. For example, order 1001 has two pickings at 10:15 and 11:00. But since it is a single day, perhaps they are part of one activity? Or maybe each item is considered separate events."

Since we have to proceed logically based on data provided, and since each line item has a unique timestamp, perhaps it is better to treat each as individual events. So for every non-zero quantity entry in Order Lines, create an event Items Picked with the items picking time."

For example, DLV-5001 has dispatch at 08:30 and arrival at 14:45 for order 1001. So perhaps these represent Order Dispatched event from the Dispatch time, then Order Arrived after a delay. Each delivery record should generate two events for the same case: Order Dispatched event with timestamp = dispatch date/time, Order Arrived event with timestamp = arrival date/time."

    "Text": "For order 1002: two deliveries DLV-5002 and DLV-5003. But the dates are different. So this suggests that an order can have multiple shipments (maybe partial fulfillments) which would be split into separate deliveries. In real-world scenarios, splitting orders is possible but process mining should capture these splits as forks in the process tree. However, given our task to create a single event log where each event row represents part of the trace for that case instance, this may not align with actual traces if multiple shipments are present."

    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "This suggests a potential issue in mapping: shipments with split orders may result in separate traces. But according to the problem statement, we need to include every event per order_id as individual rows (events) not tied together by case instance? Or is each delivery considered part of the same process instance? This requires clarification, but given that the problem states every event for every order_id is included, I think it is intended to model all events related to an order as separate traces. But noâ€”the instruction says: produce one row per event and include key steps in lifecycle of each order."

    "Text": "Given time constraints, perhaps proceed under each delivery record generates its own two dispatch/arrival events. So for order 1002: DISPATCH at Jan4T07:20Z (DLV-5002), ARRIVE at Jan7T16:10Z, Then another DISPATCH at Jan5T07:00Z (DLV-5003), ARRIVE at Jan8T10:00Z. Even though it is not logical because dispatching twice doesnt make sense unless it is a new shipment."

    "Text": "This suggests a flaw in our approach because you cant dispatch twice. To resolve, perhaps some deliveries have invalid timestamps and should be ignored? Not sure. Given time constraints and need to proceed, perhaps create two Order Dispatched events for each delivery in the same case_id but ordered by their dispatch timestamp: For order 1002: DISPATCH1 at Jan4T07:20Z (from DLV-5002), DISPATCH2 at Jan5T07:00Z (from DLV-5003). But this would imply two separate dispatchees for the same case, which isnt possible."
