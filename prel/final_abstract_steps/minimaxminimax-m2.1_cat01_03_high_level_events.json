    "Text": "Let me analyze the event log and identify patterns to group the low-level events into meaningful high-level steps. Looking at the event log, I can see two cases (A1 and B2) with nearly identical sequences of events, which makes it easier to identify the patterns. Let me break down the events chronologically: 1. Retrieve raw metal sheet - Operator A 2. Scan barcode - Operator A 3. Place metal sheet on table - Operator A 4. Align metal sheet - Robot Arm #2 5. Preheat metal sheet - Heating Unit #1 6. Pick up welding tool - Operator B 7. Weld corner A - Operator B 8. Weld corner B - Operator B 9. Measure weld integrity - Quality Sensor #1 10. Apply protective coating - Coating Unit #3 11. Dry coating - Heating Unit #2 12. Visual check - Operator C"

    "Text": "Now I need to group these into meaningful high-level steps: **Step 1: Material Preparation** - Retrieve raw metal sheet Scan barcode Place metal sheet on table Align metal sheet Preheat metal sheet Rationale: These events all relate to getting the raw material ready for processing. They involve the initial handling and preparation of the metal sheet before any assembly or modification begins. **Step 2: Assembly/Welding** - Pick up welding tool Weld corner A Weld corner B Measure weld integrity Rationale: These events are all related to the actual assembly work - joining the metal pieces together through welding. The weld integrity measurement is a quality check immediately following the welding process, which makes sense to include in this phase as it is directly related to the assembly work. **Step 3: Post-Processing/Coating** - Apply protective coating Dry coating Rationale: These events are clearly related to applying and drying the protective coating, which happens after the assembly is complete. **Step 4: Quality Inspection** - Visual check  - The final step ensures the product meets all required standards before being considered complete."

    "Text": "**Step 1: Material Preparation** This initial stage focuses on transforming raw materials into a production-ready state. It involves precise handling, identification, and initial preparation of the metal sheet before any manufacturing operations commence. The sequence ensures each component is properly tracked, positioned, and prepared for subsequent processing. Key activities include retrieving the raw material, scanning its barcode for traceability, placing it on the work table, using robotic alignment for precision, and applying initial thermal treatment. These preparatory steps are critical for maintaining product quality and ensuring accurate tracking throughout the manufacturing workflow. The process systematically moves the raw material through controlled stages, minimizing potential errors and establishing a foundation for consistent production. Each action builds upon the previous one, creating a methodical approach to material preparation. Subsequent steps involve assembly, where the prepared material undergoes transformation through precise welding operations. The welding process is carefully controlled, with each corner meticulously joined using specific techniques. Immediate quality verification follows, with integrity sensors assessing the structural soundness of the welds before proceeding. The assembly phase emphasizes precision, tool management, and immediate quality control, ensuring that each weld meets strict manufacturing standards. Post-processing introduces protective coating application and controlled drying, which enhances the components durability and surface characteristics. This stage represents a critical transition between manufacturing and final quality assessment. The final quality inspection provides comprehensive visual verification, confirming the components overall integrity and compliance with established production specifications."
