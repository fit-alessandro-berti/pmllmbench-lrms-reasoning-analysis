    "Text": "4 Review and Refine Ill read through the generated code and compare it one last time with the scenario description Imports are correct All activities are defined as Transition The loop BNC DR is correctly defined as OperatorPOWLOperatorLOOP BNC DR The choice CD MD is correctly defined as OperatorPOWLOperatorXOR CD MD The root StrictPartialOrder contains all the top level nodes All precedence constraints are correctly represented by edges The concurrency is correctly represented by the absence of an edge eg no edge between DA and ACI no edge between QA and SA The code is clean well commented and follows the structure requested in the prompt This systematic process ensures all requirements from the prompt are captured accurately in the final Python code The key is to break down the narrative into structural components sequence parallelism loop choice and then map those components directly to the POWL classes The final assembly step is just a matter of connecting the dots with the addedge calls"
