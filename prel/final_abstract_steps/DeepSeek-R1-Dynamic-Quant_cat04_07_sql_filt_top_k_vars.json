That sounds like using GROUP_CONCAT or something similar, but DuckDB might have specific functions. Oh right, DuckDB supports array_agg which can aggregate ordered values into an array. Wait, maybe it's better to use STRING_AGG with ordering."

For example, for each variant (activity sequence), count the number of case_ids under it, order by this count descending, take the first K rows, collect their activity sequences, and then find all case_ids in those sequences.

But in the problem statement, they don't specify K as part of the prompt's input; likely, we can hardcode K (e.g., top 5) or use a placeholder variable. Since SQL doesn't have variables unless using prepared statements, but for simplicity here perhaps replace LIMIT K with a specific number."
