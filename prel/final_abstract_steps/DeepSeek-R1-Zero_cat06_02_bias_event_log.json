This adjustment is key since it impacts decisions in borderline cases (e.g., C003 rejected at 715, while C001 approved at a similar adjusted 720)."

C003 was rejected despite a relatively high score of 715, while C005 was approved with 740. This suggests 'LocalResident' is less impactful compared to 'CommunityGroup.'"
