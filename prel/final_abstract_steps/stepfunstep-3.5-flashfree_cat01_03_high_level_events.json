    "Text": "I should consider temporal proximity The first five events happen within 15 seconds 080005 to 080020 then theres a 40 second gap before the next event at 080100 So maybe the first group is material preparation Then welding activities from 080100 to 080120 are close together followed by measurement right after at 080120 Then coating and drying are close and visual check is separate at the end"

    "Text": "But is Weld Quality Check a separate step or part of welding Since it happens right after welding and is a separate activity by a different resource sensor it might be its own quality assurance step Similarly coating and drying are two actions but logically part of one phase applying and curing the coating"

    "Text": "Rationale Group by logical sequence resource changes and temporal clusters For example all events up to preheat are about preparing the metal sheet Then welding related events are consecutive and by Operator B The weld measure follows immediately after welding so its part of verifying that step Coating and drying are done by units specific to coating and visual check is a separate human inspection"

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "However in the sample only weld integrity is measured and then coating is applied So after coating theres no measurement of coating just visual check at the end Check if any event could be in multiple groups For example preheating is part of material prep not welding Drying coating is part of coating not a separate step"
