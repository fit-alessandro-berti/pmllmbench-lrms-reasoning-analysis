Let me start by understanding each constraint and how they apply to the order fulfillment process. First, the activities are: RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP. Let me think about the order of these activities. Starting with Receive Order (RO) thats the first step. Then, they check availability (CA). Once CA is done, they might reserve items (RI). Then pick items (PI), then quality check (QC), pack (PO), generate shipping label (GSL), dispatch (D), invoice (IC), and record payment (RP)."

The constraint is: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. So, for example, if the first activity is CA, then the second activity (say RO) must have been executed before CA. So the pair would be (CA, RO), meaning that whenever CA occurs, RO must have occurred before. Which is correct. So (CA, RO) would be a valid always_before pair."

Alternatively, perhaps the Always After constraint is that the first activity must occur after the second... Which is the same as the Always Before constraint... This is confusing... Alternatively, perhaps the Always After constraint is that the second activity must be executed after the first... So the pair (A, B) in always_after means that A must occur before B... Which is the same as (B, A) in always_before... But this would mean that for every pair where A must be before B, we have (A, B) in always_after and (B, A) in always_before.
