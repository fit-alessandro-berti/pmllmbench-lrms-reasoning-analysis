    "Text": "Okay, lets tackle this problem step by step. The goal is to rename recurring activities within each case so that their context is clear. Let me start by looking at each case individually and then see if theres a pattern across all cases. Looking at Case C001 first. The activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents (twice), Call Customer, Submit Additional... Wait, the third activity for C001 is Call Customer which happens after verification was incomplete. Then later theres Submit Additional. Thats part of SelfServe by customer. So the two Verify Documents steps in this case have different contexts. The first one is done by BackOfficeAgent as identity check, then after a call to get missing docs, they do it again with all documents."

    "Text": "In C002, Initiate Request, then two Verify Documents (by agent), then Call Customer for clarification, Adjust Account, another Call Customer follow-up, and Approve. Here the second Verify might be similar but perhaps different? Like first verifying initial identity, then after adjustment maybe a re-verification isnt needed here. Wait, in C002s case: The adjust account is done by BackOfficeAgent internally after call. Then theres a follow-up call to confirm adjustments. So for each recurring activity, I need to find what changed between occurrences. Lets list out the activities per case: Case C001: 1. Initiate Request (WebPortal) 2. Verify Documents (BackOfficeAgent) - first verification 3. Call Customer (FrontlineAgent) after incomplete verification. 4. Submit Additional... (CustomerSelfServe) where customer uploads missing docs. 5. Verify Documents again (BackofficeAgent) now with ID scan provided. 6. Approve Request (Supervisor) So the two Verifies here are different: first is checking identity documents, second after submission of additional docs."

Call Customer again (follow-up to confirm adjustments) 6. Approve Here the two Verifies here might not be present? Wait, no. C002 has Verify Documents only once. Then after adjust account and a follow-up call. Hmm. So in this case, maybe theres only one Verify Document step, but then why is there another activity called Call Customer for clarification followed by adjustment and confirmation? Wait, perhaps the problem statement says that within a single case, same activities appear multiple times with different contexts. But looking at C002: Initiate Request, Verify Documents (once), Call Customer (twice). So maybe in this case, only Call Customer occurs twice but under different reasons?"

    "Text": "Wait the original log for C002: After initiate and verify documents (which is done by BackOfficeAgent?), then call customer outbound. Then adjust account internally after call. Then follow-up call to confirm adjustments. So perhaps in this case, Call Customer occurs twice but under different contexts: first as an outbound call during verification process, second as a confirmation after adjustment. But the problem states that same activity names appear multiple times within a single case with different meanings. So for each such occurrence, we need to rename them so their context is clear. Similarly, in C003: Initiate Request (BranchReception), Verify Documents (BranchOfficer physically), then Call Customer (BranchOfficer calling customer back), Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent), Verify Documents again (now after adjustment?), and Approve. So here the two Verifies are: first physical check of ID, second re-check after account correction due to missing info."

    "Text": "Now, looking for recurring activities across cases. For example, Verify Documents appears in all three cases multiple times but each time with different context. Similarly, Call Customer occurs twice in C001 and once in C002? Wait no: In C001, Call Customer is one event; in C002, two events (outbound call for clarification and follow-up). But the problem says same activity names within a single case. So per case: C001 has Verify Documents twice. C002 doesnt have any recurring activities except maybe Call Customer once? Wait no: Let me check again. Wait original data: Case C001s events are: 1. Initiate Request 2. Verify Documents (BackOfficeAgent) 3. Call Customer (FrontlineAgent)  after incomplete verification. 4. Submit Additional... (CustomerSelfServe) by customer. 5. Verify Documents again (BackofficeAgent with ID scan provided). 6. Approve Request. So here, Verify Documents occurs twice in the same case. Case C002: 1. Initiate Request 2. Verify Documents (by BackOfficeAgent?) 3. Call Customer (Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy) 4. Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent internally after call.) 5. Call Customer again (follow-up to confirm adjustments). 6. Approve. So here, Call Customer occurs twice in the same case but under different contexts: first as an outbound during verification process, second for confirmation post-adjustment. Case C003: 1. Initiate Request 2. Verify Documents (BranchOfficer physically) 3. Call Customer (BranchOfficer calls customer to have them return.) 4. Adjust Account (BackOfficeAgent internal correction due to missing info.) 5. Verify Documents again (BranchOfficer re-check after adjustment?) 6. Approve. So here, Verify Documents occurs twice in the same case: first physical verification at branch, second after account adjustment possibly because of some issue or as part of standard procedure post-adjustment."

    "Text": "Now, for each recurring activity within a case, we need to rename them so their names reflect context. Lets list per case which activities recur: Case C001: - Activity A: Verify Documents occurs twice. Need to rename them differently. First occurrence (step2): Agent checks identity documents when verification was incomplete. Second occurrence (step5): After customer self-service submission of additional docs and agent re-checks now that ID scan is provided. Possible new names: 1st Verify  Initial Identity Verification 2nd Verify  Post-Self-Service Documentation Check or just Document Re-Verification. But whats the difference between them? The first is checking identity documents when initial verification was incomplete. Then after customer uploads additional docs (via self-service), they do another check, maybe to confirm that all required docs are now present. Alternatively, since in C002 and C003 theres only one Verify Documents step except for when Adjust Account happens followed by a re-verification? Not exactly. Lets check: Wait no: For example, in Case C001s second verify is after Submit Additional (which was self-service), then the agent does another verification. In any case, within each case, we need to rename activities that recur with different context. So for C001: 1st Verify Documents  Identity Document Verification Initial 2nd Verify Documents  Re-Verify Complete Documentation or just Documentation Recheck Post-Self-Service. Alternatively, using a different method like adding prefixes: First Initial Document Verification, second Final Document Check. But the goal is to make sure that each names clearly reflects its role. So for C001: First occurrence of Verify Documents (step2): Agent checks identity documents when incomplete. Second occurrence (step5): After customer self-service submission, agent re-checks with provided ID scan. Maybe this second verify confirms all required documentation now includes the scanned ID? So perhaps first Identity Document Verification and second Documentation Re-Verification with Self-Service Submission. But that might be too verbose. Alternatively, since in C001s case, after submitting additional documents via self-service (step4), they do a re-verification to ensure everything is correct. Alternatively, the two Verifies could have different activity names such as: First: Verify Identity Documents Second: Re-Synchronize Documentation or something else. But perhaps more accurately reflecting their role in each step. Similarly for other cases. Case C002: The recurring activities are two instances of Call Customer. So need to rename them based on context. First call (step3): Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy. Second call (step5): Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made after internal adjustment by BackOfficeAgent. So possible new names: 1st Call  Clarification Call 2nd Call  Confirmation Follow-Up Call or just Follow-Up Confirmation. Alternatively, use more descriptive terms like Outbound Clarification Call and Inbound Post-Adjustment Verification Call. But maybe the first is outbound clarification during investigation phase, second after adjustments have been made. Case C003: Two instances of Verify Documents. First occurrence (step2): Physical verification by BranchOfficer at branch with customer present. Second occurrence (step5): After adjusting account due to missing info. So perhaps this re-verification ensures that the adjustment was correct and all necessary documents are in order now? So possible new names: 1st Verify  Physical ID Verification 2nd Verify  Post-Adjustment Documentation Recheck. Alternatively, given its a branch scenario: first is physical check at location with customer; second could be internal verification after account correction."

C002: - The two Call Customer activities are renamed to Clarification Call and Post-Adjustment Confirmation Call. This distinction highlights their different purposes: one during investigation, the other as confirmation after adjustments. - Account Adjustment is retained but in original log step4 was called Adjust Account; no need for renaming here since its a unique activity. C003: - First Verify Documents renamed to Physical ID Check emphasizing physical verification at branch. - Second Rename to Post-Correction ID Recheck indicating re-verification after internal account correction due to missing info. This clarifies that the second check is part of post-correction steps. This approach ensures each activitys name reflects its specific role and timing in the process, disambiguating any overlapping contexts within individual cases."
