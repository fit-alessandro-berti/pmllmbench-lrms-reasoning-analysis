  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "First the process starts with Receive Customer Request That makes sense every business process usually begins with receiving some kind of request from a customer Then theres a gateway that splits the process into two paths based on the type of request Standard or Custom I think gateways in BPMN are decision points so XOR gateways mean exclusive choices only one path is taken So if the request is standard it goes to Task B1 and if its custom it goes to Task B2"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Task B1 is Perform Standard Validation I guess this is where they check if the standard request meets certain criteria maybe like checking if the product is in stock or if the customers credit is good Then after validation theres an AND gateway which means both paths have to run in parallel So for a standard request they do both a Credit Check and an Inventory Check at the same time After both are done they join back at All Parallel Checks Completed leading to Task D Calculate Delivery Date That part seems straightforward"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "On the custom side Task B2 is Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis Custom orders might be more complex so they need to assess if its feasible Then theres another XOR gateway to decide if the customization is feasible If yes they prepare a custom quotation Task E1 If no they send a rejection notice Task E2 and end the process"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "After both the standard and custom paths theres a convergence point where it goes to another XOR gateway Is Approval Needed So regardless of whether it was standard or custom after their respective tasks Task D or E1 the process checks if approval is needed If yes Task F Obtain Manager Approval is done Then another XOR gateway checks if the approval is granted If yes it goes to Task G Generate Final Invoice If no it loops back either to Task E1 custom path or Task D standard path for re evaluation"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If approval isnt needed it skips to Task G directly Finally Task I Send Confirmation to Customer is the last step before the process ends"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait let me make sure Im getting this right So for the standard request after calculating the delivery date it goes to the approval check If approval is needed they get it and if granted they generate the invoice If not granted they loop back to re evaluate which for standard would be back to Task D Or maybe the re evaluation step is a separate task The diagram says Task H Re evaluate Conditions and then loops back to either E1 or D based on the path So for standard H would loop back to Task D and for custom to E1"

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Im a bit confused about how the re evaluation step works If the manager doesnt approve do they just go back to the same point or is there a different task involved Also how does the process handle if the quotation needs changes Does it loop back to the feasibility analysis or the quotation preparation"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Another thing Im trying to figure out is how tasks differ between standard and custom For standard its validation parallel checks then delivery date For custom its feasibility analysis then checking feasibility possibly preparing a quotation which might require approval The standard might not need as much back and forth because its more straightforward while custom could involve more iterations if the quotation isnt approved"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So putting it all together the process is designed to handle two types of customer requests standard and custom each with their own validation and approval steps The standard path is more streamlined while the custom path involves more checks and potential re evaluations if approvals are denied The gateways control the flow based on conditions and the AND gateway allows parallel processing for efficiency"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think Ive got a good grasp now The key points are understanding the split between standard and custom the parallel tasks in the standard path the multiple decision points with gateways and the loop back for re evaluation if approval isnt granted This structure ensures that both types of requests are handled appropriately with the necessary checks and approvals in place"
