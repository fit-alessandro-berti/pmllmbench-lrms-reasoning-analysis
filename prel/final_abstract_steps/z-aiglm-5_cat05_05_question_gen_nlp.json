Key elements include R&D, global sourcing (Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Germany, US), assembly in Malaysia, global logistics/distribution (air/sea), different replenishment strategies (JIT vs. aggregated), sales channels (retail, e-commerce, direct), regulatory compliance, quality assurance, digital systems/analytics, and sustainability goals. Task: Generate 20 thought-provoking, open-ended questions. Focus Areas: Insights, potential issues, strategies for improvement, implications of decisions. Constraint: Do not provide SQL queries. Just list the questions."

    "Text": "Deconstruct the Process & Brainstorming Themes: Theme 1: Supply Chain Resilience & Risk Management. Multiple international suppliers imply geopolitical risks. Single assembly plant in Malaysia creates a bottleneck risk. Idea: What happens if the Malaysia plant goes offline? What if a key supplier (microprocessors) faces a shortage? Theme 2: Logistics & Transportation Strategy. Air freight vs. cargo ships. Trade-off between speed and cost. Customs and regulatory hurdles. Idea: How to balance the carbon footprint of air freight against the speed required for high-demand markets? Theme 3: Inventory Management & Forecasting. JIT vs. Aggregated monthly. Accuracy of ML models. Bullwhip effect. And similarly for other themes."

Draft 2 (Logistics): Is air freight too expensive? -> Refinement: Considering the trade-offs between cost and speed, what criteria determine whether a specific shipment utilizes air freight versus sea freight, and how does this decision impact the overall carbon footprint? And continuing for drafts 3 through 20 with refinements."

    "Text": "Review and Final Polish: Check against constraints: 20 questions? Yes. Thought-provoking? Yes, they explore trade-offs and risks. Open-ended? Yes, they require explanation, not yes/no. No SQL? Yes. Based on the text? Yes. Self-Correction during drafting: I initially thought about asking about specific software names (like SAP), but the text doesnt mention them. I should keep the questions grounded in the texts context (digital systems, ML, etc.) rather than inventing details. I ensured the questions cover the full scope: R&D, Sourcing, Manufacturing, Logistics, and Sales/After-sales."
