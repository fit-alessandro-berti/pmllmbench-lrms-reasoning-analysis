The process starts with the patient arriving, which is the first activity (A). Then, they go through registration (RG), intake assessment (IA), and triage (both interview and classification, labeled TI and TC). After the triage, they choose between a comprehensive ECG (CE) or FBP (FBP)."

    "Text": "Once the initial test is done, they must undergo exclusive treatment choices (TM or SPT). After treatment, they do a re-diagnostic test (RDT), which is another exclusive choice (SC). This loop continues if the results are abnormal, so I need to model this as a loop using the * operator."

    "Text": "After the loop ends when results are normal, they move on to advanced imaging (AI) and nutritional counseling (NC) in true concurrency. Finally, they go through follow-up appointment scheduling (FAS) and detailed discharge instructions (DDI), which are in parallel, and then billing (BL), insurance claims processing (ICP), and medical records finalization (MRF) in true concurrency before the patient is released."

    "Text": "Now, I need to represent this as a process tree. The root will be the arrival (A). From A, the next step is registration (RG). RG is a leaf, so its label is 'RG'. After RG, we have IA (leaf, label 'IA'). IA is followed by a choice between CE and FBP, but the choice is exclusive, so I'll model this as an operator. The operator X (exclusive choice) would be used between CE and FBP."
