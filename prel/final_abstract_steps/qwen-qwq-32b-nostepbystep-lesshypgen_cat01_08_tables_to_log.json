The activity would be 'Item Picked' (singular?), but the user's example says 'Items Picked' event(s). Hmm, the instructions say 'produce one event per activity if itâ€™s meaningful'. Since each item's pick has its own time, maybe each item is an event. So each row in Order Lines becomes an 'Item Picked' event with the item_picking_date as the timestamp, and the picker from the picker_id in Resources."

The user says it's optional, so maybe just include if possible. Alternatively, use the carrier_id mapped via the Resources Table, which has the carrier names. That would make sense.
