    "Text": "First, Ill look at the data provided. There are 15 events for Machine M1 over a 1-minute span. Starting with Event 1 to 3: Temperature is around 20C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0, material flow 0, tool at 0mm, energy ~0.5 kWh. These seem like baseline readings—maybe the machine is idle or in a resting state. Then Events 4-6: Temperature jumps to 50-58C, pressure slightly increases to 1.5 bar, vibration goes up to 30-38 Hz, material flow is 5 units/s, tool moves to 5mm, 7mm, then 10mm. Energy consumption spikes to 2-3 kWh. This looks like an active process. High temperature and vibration suggest something like cutting or drilling. Events 7-8: Temperature drops to 40C, pressure up to 2 bar, vibration lower (10 Hz), material flow drops to 2 units/s, tool position stays at 15mm. Energy is 2 kWh. Events 9: Temperature spikes to 80C, pressure 2 bar, vibration 50 Hz, material flow 0, tool at 15mm. Energy jumps to 5 kWh. Event 10: Temperature drops to 30C, pressure back to 1 bar, vibration low (1 Hz), material flow 0, tool at 15mm. Energy is 1 kWh. Events 11-13: Temperature goes to 25C, pressure 1, vibration 5, material flow starts at 1, tool moves to 20mm. Then Event 13 brings temperature back to 20, flow to 0, tool back to 0. Events 14-15 are similar to the initial idle state again."

    "Text": "Now, grouping these into activities: 1. Idle/Startup (Events 1-3, 13-15): Low temps, no flow, tool at 0. This is likely the machine being idle or in a resting state between operations. 2. Cutting Metal (Events 4-6): High temp, vibration, material flow, tool moving. The increasing tool position suggests cutting action, moving along the material. 3. Possible Transition or Assembly (Events 7-8): Lower vibration but higher pressure. 4. Welding (Event 9): The spike in temp and vibration with no material flow. 5. Cooling/Post-Weld (Event 10): Cooling down after welding. 6. Assembling (Events 11-12): Material flow starts again, tool moves to 20mm."

    "Text": "Wait, but Events 7-8 have material flow at 2 units/s. Maybe thats part of the cutting phase? Alternatively, maybe Events 7-8 are part of a different activity like Material Transfer or Positioning. Alternatively, perhaps Events 7-8 are part of the welding preparation? Alternatively, maybe Events 7-8 are part of the cutting phases end. Alternatively, maybe the pressure increase in 7-8 is part of welding setup. Alternatively, maybe events7-8 are part of Assembling Parts. Alternatively, perhaps the sequence after cutting is: Material Transfer/Positioning (7-8)."

    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe Events 7-8 are part of the welding setup. Alternatively, maybe the entire sequence from 4 to 8 is cutting, but with varying parameters. Hmm. Another angle: energy consumption. Alternatively, looking at pressure: in events4-6, pressure is 1.5 bar, then in 7-8 its 2 bar. Higher pressure might indicate clamping or something for welding. Alternatively, maybe the cutting is done in 4-6, then the tool moves to 15mm (events7-8) which is a position for welding. Alternatively, maybe the entire sequence from 4 to 9 is welding? No. Alternatively, events7-8 might be part of the transition between cutting and welding. Alternatively, maybe events7-8 are part of the cutting phase continuing."

    "Text": "The tool position progression: 0mm (idle), 5,7,10 (cutting), 15 (positioning), 15 (welding), 15 (post-weld), 20 (assembling), back to 0. This suggests that after cutting (moving to 10mm), the tool moves to 15mm for welding. Thus, the activities would be: Cutting Metal (4-6): Tool moving from 0 to 10mm, high temp/vibration, material flow. Welding (7-9): Tool at 15mm. Events7-8 might be positioning/clamping (lower temp), then event9 is actual welding."

    "Text": "Another thought: Quality Inspection might involve checking parameters without movement. For example, after welding, maybe sensors check the weld quality. Event10: Temp 30, pressure 1, vibration 1, tool at 15mm. Maybe thats inspection. Activity 4: Quality Inspection (Event 10): Rationale: Low vibration and stable parameters suggest sensors are taking measurements without active tool movement."

    "Text": "So final grouping: 1. Idle/Start (1-3, 13-15) 2. Cutting Metal (4-6) 3. Welding (7-9) 4. Quality Inspection (10) 5. Assembling Parts (11-12) This uses four of the five labels, omitting Packaging. Cutting Metal: High temp, vibration, material flow, tool movement. Welding: Event9 has extreme temp and vibration with no material flow. Events7-8 could be setup (positioning/clamping) before welding. Quality Inspection: Event10 has low vibration and stable parameters. Assembling Parts: Material flow resumes but at lower rate, tool moves to new position. This seems to fit."
