Well, in the process, all the steps are part of the process, so maybe all activities are required. But maybe not. For example, maybe some steps are optional. But since the scenario describes a complex process, perhaps all steps are required. But maybe not. For example, maybe some products don't need user testing? But the problem says 'complex, multi-department product design and launch process', so maybe all steps are part of the process. So for existence, maybe all activities are required. But the problem says that for the keys existence, absence, exactly_one, init, the value is a dict with activities and support and confidence. But support and confidence are 1.0? Or maybe the user expects me to set them as 1.0? The prompt says 'the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule.' So for existence, each activity in the key would have support 1.0 and confidence 1.0. But maybe that's not correct. Wait, the problem says that the value is a dictionary with activities as keys and the corresponding value is support (1.0) and confidence.

Wait, the description says for 'responded_existence', the value is a dictionary with activities as keys and support and confidence. But what does that mean? The 'responded_existence' constraint is that if an activity occurs, then another activity must exist. So for example, if AG occurs, then FL must occur. So the 'responded_existence' would have AG as the key, and the value would be the support and confidence. But how to represent the 'responded' part? Maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe the 'responded_existence' is a rule that for each activity A, there exists an activity B that must occur after A. But I'm not sure. The DECLARE model's 'responded_existence' is a constraint that says if A occurs, then B must occur. But how is this represented in the dictionary? For example, in the DECLARE model, for 'responded_existence', the value is a dictionary where each key is an activity A, and the value is a dictionary with the activity B that must be present after A, along with support and confidence. But the problem statement says that for the keys like 'responded_existence', the value is a dictionary with activities as keys and the corresponding value is support and confidence.
