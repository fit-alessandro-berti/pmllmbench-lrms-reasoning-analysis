The goal is to filter events to include only those from the top K process variants based on frequency or significance. The event log table, named event_log, contains key columns: case_id, activity, and timestamp."

Use another CTE, top_variants, to count variant frequencies, order by frequency, and limit to top K variants, treating K as a parameter. Filter cases to include only those whose variants match the top K by joining or using IN with the top_variants CTE. Finally, select from the event_log where case_id belongs to the filtered cases, ensuring all events from relevant cases are included."
