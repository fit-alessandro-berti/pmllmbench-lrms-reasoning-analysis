Then the user types in Document1.docx, saves it, and then switches to Chrome to handle an email. After the email, the user switches to Acrobat to view a PDF, then to Excel to update a budget, and then back to Word (Document1.docx) to insert a reference and save again, then closes Document1.docx. Then the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx, types, saves, and closes."

But note that the user goes back to Document1.docx after working on Excel, so Document1.docx is one continuous case? However, the user started with Quarterly_Report.docx, then switched to Document1.docx, then after other tasks came back to Document1.docx and then to Quarterly_Report.docx."

    "Text": "Let's look for natural breaks: The first event is FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx, but then immediately switches to Document1.docx (at 09:00:00). So the initial focus on Quarterly_Report might be a brief check and then the user starts working on Document1.docx. The work on Document1.docx: from 09:00:00 (FOCUS) until 09:07:00 (CLOSE). But note: there is a break when the user switches to email and then to Acrobat and Excel. However, the user returns to Document1.docx at 09:06:00 to add a reference. So it seems the entire session on Document1.docx (with interruptions) is one case? But in process mining, we usually consider a case as a single instance of a process. Here, the user is working on a document (Document1.docx) and then after doing other tasks (email, pdf review, excel) comes back to it. This might be considered as the same case because the document is the same."

So: All events related to Document1.docx form one case. All events related to Quarterly_Report.docx form another case. The email: we don't have a unique identifier for the email, but we can use the action Email about Annual Meeting as the case? ... Similarly, for the PDF and Excel, we can use the document name."

    "Text": "However, note that the initial FOCUS on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50 was very brief and then the user switched away immediately to Document1.docx. However, the user comes back at 09:07:15 and does more work. So should we include the initial focus? It's very brief and no activity. Alternatively, we might consider that the initial focus was not part of the main work on this document? But the log shows it. However, the problem says: group related events into coherent cases. The initial focus might be the start of a case that was then interrupted by Document1.docx, and then resumed at the end."

    "Text": "Given the problem says: a logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document, and the document is the same, we should group by the document. So the entire time from the first focus on Quarterly_Report until it is closed (which happens at 09:08:15) is one case? But note: the user did not close it after the initial focus, and then worked on other things. The close event is at the end. However, the log does not show a close event for the initial focus. The close event for Quarterly_Report is at 09:08:15. So we can consider the case as starting at 08:59:50 and ending at 09:08:15. But the problem: the user was working on Document1.docx during the gap. So the case for Quarterly_Report was suspended and then resumed. This is acceptable in process mining (e.g., in case of interruptions). So we'll have one case for Quarterly_Report."

But in our case grouping, the case for the from document might be suspended (if not closed) and the case for the to document is activated. However, the SWITCH event does not directly correspond to an activity in the case. It's a transition. Therefore, we will not include SWITCH events as events in the event log. Instead, the end of a case segment is implied by the next event in another case."
