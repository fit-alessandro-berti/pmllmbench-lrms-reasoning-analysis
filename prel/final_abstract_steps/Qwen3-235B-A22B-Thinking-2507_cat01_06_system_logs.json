But note that the user goes back to Document1.docx after working on Excel, so Document1.docx is one continuous case? However, the user started with Quarterly_Report.docx, then switched to Document1.docx, then after other tasks came back to Document1.docx and then to Quarterly_Report.docx. Lets look for natural breaks: - The first event is FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx, but then immediately switches to Document1.docx (at 09:00:00). So the initial focus on Quarterly_Report might be a brief check and then the user starts working on Document1.docx."

However, note that the user left to do other tasks and came back. But the same document is being edited. So we can consider the entire time from the first focus on Document1.docx until the close as one case? But note: the user had a FOCUS on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50 and then switched to Document1.docx at 09:00:00. So the Quarterly_Report might be a separate case. ... For Quarterly_Report, the only events are: 08:59:50 FOCUS 09:07:15 FOCUS (after closing Document1.docx) 09:07:45 TYPING 09:08:00 SAVE 09:08:15 CLOSE So the case for Quarterly_Report has two sessions. Well keep it as one case."

Proposed activity names for document editing: - Start Editing (for the first focus on the document in the case, or when returning after a break? But we want to avoid too many activities) ... Proposed standardized activity names (trying to be consistent where possible): - For any application, when the user starts interacting with a document (first focus in the case): Start Working on [Document] but we dont want to include the document name in the activity. Instead, we have the document as the case. ... For cases related to a document (Word, Excel, PDF): - Activate Document: for FOCUS events (in Word, Excel) and also for the initial view in Acrobat? But in Acrobat, we dont have a FOCUS event, we have SCROLL and HIGHLIGHT. However, the user switched to Acrobat, so the document was activated. But we dont have an event for that activation. The first event in Acrobat is SCROLL. So we cannot log an Activate for Acrobat."

    "Text": "3. Event Attributes: - Case ID: well use the document name (sanitized) for document cases, and for email well use the email subject (sanitized). ... 4. Coherent Narrative: Well create one row per event in the original log, but grouped by case and with transformed activity names. However, note: the SWITCH events are transitions between cases, but they dont belong to any single case. They are the end of one case and the start of another? But in our grouping, the SWITCH event itself is not part of the case. The case ends when the user leaves (but we dont have an explicit event for leaving, except for CLOSE). How to handle SWITCH events? - The SWITCH event indicates that the user is leaving the current application and going to another. But in our case grouping, the case for the from document might be suspended (if not closed) and the case for the to document is activated. However, the SWITCH event does not directly correspond to an activity in the case. Its a transition. Therefore, we will not include SWITCH events as events in the event log. Instead, the end of a case segment is implied by the next event in another case."

Additional note: The initial FOCUS on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50 is included as the first event of the case. However, the user did not do any typing until 09:07:45. So the first Activate Document is just the start, and then there is a long gap. This is acceptable. 7. Explanation: Case Identification: - Cases were identified based on the document or email being worked on. Each unique document (by filename) and each unique email (by subject) was treated as a separate case. ... Activity Naming: - Low-level actions were mapped to higher-level activities: ... Note: SWITCH events were excluded from the event log as they represent transitions between cases and do not correspond to an activity within a single case. The resulting event log tells a coherent story of the users work sessions, with each case representing a distinct task (document editing or email handling) and the activities within each case showing the progression of work on that task."
