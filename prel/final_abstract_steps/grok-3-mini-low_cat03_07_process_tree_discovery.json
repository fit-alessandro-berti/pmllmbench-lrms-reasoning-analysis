So, perhaps the structure is: RA -> VF -> AE -> [zero or more RMI] -> VF -> AD -> SC -> AC In Case 2, no additional VF. The additional VF is only after the RMI(s), and if there are no RMI(s), no additional VF. In the process tree, if I have after AE: * (tau, RMI), then VF, then AD, that would mean for Case 2: do * (tau, RMI) which could be just tau (no RMI), then VF, then AD â€” but in Case 2, it skips the additional VF.

Perhaps model it as: after AE, optional -> ( RMI+, VF ), where RMI+ is one or more RMI. But thats not exact."

In Case 1: choose -> ( RMI, VF ) In Case 3: but in Case 3, there are two RMI and then VF, so -> ( RMI, RMI, VF ), which isnt covered. This doesnt capture multiple RMI.

Lets say the process tree is: -> ( RA, VF, AE, * ( tau, RMI ), VF, AD, SC, AC ) This would do: RA then VF then AE then * ( tau, RMI ) which allows zero or more RMI, then VF, then AD, etc. Yes, and for Case 2, it does zero RMI, then VF, but in Case 2, it doesnt do the additional VF. So, its not perfect, but its a compromise."
