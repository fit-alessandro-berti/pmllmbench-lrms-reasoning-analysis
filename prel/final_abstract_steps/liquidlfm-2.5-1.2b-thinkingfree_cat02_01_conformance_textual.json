From the description, the steps should be: Receive order  Check inventory  if sufficient, then Authorize payment  Package  Ship  Close order. If inventory not enough, then Cancel immediately instead of proceeding. After cancellation, Close order still happens final? Wait the description says if inventory insufficient, process branches to cancellation, then close order."
