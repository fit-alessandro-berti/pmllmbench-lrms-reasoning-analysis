There is no score adjustment (ScoreAdjustment = 0). Their cultural fit scores are recorded as is (65, 60, 65 respectively). - In Group B (cases U001, U002, U003), all candidates have LocalResident = TRUE. Two of them (U001 and U003) have ProfessionalAssociation = LocalBusinessLeadersClub, while U002 has ProfessionalAssociation = None. For U001 and U003, there is a score adjustment: +5 (Association Boost) applied to the CulturalFit score. Specifically: - U001: CulturalFit recorded as 60 initially, then adjusted to 65 (60+5) in later steps. - U003: CulturalFit recorded as 58 initially, then adjusted to 63 (58+5). - U002: No association, so no adjustment (0)."

    "Text": "Now, consider the implications: - This practice gives an advantage to candidates who are part of that club, potentially overriding meritocratic evaluation. It may lead to less qualified candidates being hired over more qualified ones who are not members. - It could perpetuate existing inequalities if membership in such clubs is correlated with certain demographics (e.g., socioeconomic status, race, gender). Even if not explicitly discriminatory, it can have disparate impact. - The fairness and equity of the hiring process are compromised because the adjustment is based on a non-job-related factor (club membership) rather than on skills, personality, or cultural fit as measured objectively."
