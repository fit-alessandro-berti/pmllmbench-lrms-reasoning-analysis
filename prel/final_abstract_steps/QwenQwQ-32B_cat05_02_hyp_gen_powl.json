Like maybe sometimes they need to re-evaluate after approving again? That doesnt sound right. The loop might allow evaluating and approving multiple times, which isnt ideal because once approved, you shouldnt need to keep approving again unless theres a revision. So this could lead to multiple approvals per claim, which is an anomaly."

Alternatively, the tool might have allowed a loop thats too loose or the business rule was not properly translated, leading to over-allowing loops."
