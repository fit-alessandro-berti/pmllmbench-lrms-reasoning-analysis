After that, if inventory is sufficient, the next steps are Authorize payment, then Package items, Ship order, and finally Close order. If inventory isnt sufficient, after Check inventory, it should go to Cancel order and then Close order. The key constraints are that Authorize payment must come after Check inventory and before packaging. Package items after authorization and before shipping. Ship order only after packaging and not after cancellation. Close order is always last."
