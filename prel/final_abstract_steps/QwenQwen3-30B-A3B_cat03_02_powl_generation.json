The code adds an edge from loop to xor, which means that loop must be completed before xor starts. Then, from xor to CD and MD, meaning that after xor is done, CD and MD are executed. But that would mean that both CD and MD are executed after xor, which is not correct because the xor node is a choice. But maybe the model is designed such that the xor node is a node that, when executed, leads to the execution of one of its children. However, in the model, the children are not directly connected to the xor node, but the order edges are from the xor node to the children. This might not be the correct way, but given the example, this might be the intended approach."

Wait, no. In the code, the root is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all nodes, including QA and SA. The partial_order_qa_sa is created but not used in the root. So this is a mistake. The partial_order_qa_sa should be part of the root, and the order edges should be added to it."

Because the root is a StrictPartialOrder, and its nodes are the children of the root. So if the QA and SA are in their own partial order, then the root should include that partial order as a node. But this is getting complicated. Maybe the root is a StrictPartialOrder that contains all the nodes, and the partial_order_qa_sa is a separate StrictPartialOrder that is part of the root's nodes.

The partial_order_qa_sa is not needed, because the QA and SA are in the root's nodes, and the order edges are added between them. But the problem states that QA and SA must be in a partial order, which means they are concurrent. So in the root, there should be no edges between QA and SA. So the code should not add any edges between QA and SA. But in the current code, the root has QA and SA as nodes, and the order edges are from CD and MD to QA and SA, and from QA and SA to GLA.
