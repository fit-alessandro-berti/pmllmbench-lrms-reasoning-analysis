    "Text": "Next, after CS, two tasks can be done in parallel: Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI). Since these are concurrent, I'll create a StrictPartialOrder containing DA and ACI without any order edges. Then, CS must be connected to this partial order to ensure it happens after CS."

This loop repeats until it's stable. So, I'll model this as an OperatorPOWL with a LOOP operator, containing BNC and D&R as children."
