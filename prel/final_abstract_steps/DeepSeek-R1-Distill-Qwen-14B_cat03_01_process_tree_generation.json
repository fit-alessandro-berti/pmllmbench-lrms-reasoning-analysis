After that, RDT is done, which is another XOR between FCE and FBA. If still abnormal, the loop repeats. So this is a loop structure with * operator."

After TC, an XOR between CE and FBP. The result of the initial test leads to an evaluation, which if abnormal, triggers a loop: SC followed by XOR (TM vs SPT), then RDT (another XOR), and back to the loop if needed."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the loop node's children are SC and the sequence (X (TM, SPT) -> RDT). And RDT is an XOR between FCE and FBA."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, the order of the root's children matters because it's a SEQUENCE. So the correct order should be: A, RG, IA, TI, TC, xor_initial, loop_node, parallel_ai_nc, FAS, DDI, parallel_fin."
