Alright, first, I'll go through each case and note the activities that appear more than once. Looking at C001: Activities are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, Approve Request. So Verify Documents appears twice here."

C003: Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Verify Documents again, Approve Request. Again, Verify Documents is done twice.
