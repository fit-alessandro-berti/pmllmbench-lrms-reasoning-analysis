  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Another thing: the IN subquery may need to handle duplicates, but since it's grouping by case_id, the subquery will return each case_id only once even if they have multiple rows. Since IN matches any occurrence, that's okay."

Like: SELECT e1.* FROM event_log e1 WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log e2 WHERE e2.case_id = e1.case_id GROUP BY e2.case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 ) But this might not be correct because the subquery with GROUP BY inside the EXISTS might not be standard.
