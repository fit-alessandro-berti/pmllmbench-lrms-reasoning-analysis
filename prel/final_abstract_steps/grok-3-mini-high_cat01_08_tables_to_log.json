For process mining, it's often better to have events at the case level if possible, but since picking might happen at different times for different items, I should consider having separate events for each picking if the timestamps differ. However, the prompt says: \"produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate.\" For simplicity, and since the case is per order, I might want to have a single \"Items Picked\" event per order, but that would require choosing a timestamp. Looking at the data, for order 1001, there are two items picked at different times: 10:15 and 11:00 on the same day. Similarly for others. To maintain chronological order, it might be better to have separate events for each item picking, but that could make the log very granular. The prompt says: \"Items Picked\" event(s), so plural, suggesting multiple events are possible.\n\nIn process mining, events should represent activities, and if picking each item is a separate activity, it might be included. But to keep it manageable, perhaps I can have one \"Items Picked\" event per order line, using the item_picking_date and picker_id."
