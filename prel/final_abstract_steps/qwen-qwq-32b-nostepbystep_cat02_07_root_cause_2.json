Case 2002: - Submit: 2024-04-01 09:05 - Close: 2024-04-02 11:00 Hmm, that's from April 1st to April 2nd. Let's compute the days and hours. From 9:05 to 23:59 on the first day is about 14 hours 54 minutes, plus 11 hours on the second day. Total is around 25.9 hours, so roughly a day and a half? Wait, actually, subtract start time from end time. Let me do it properly: April 1st 09:05 to April 2nd 11:00 is 26 hours and 55 minutes. So about 26.9 hours. Case 2003: Submit: 2024-04-01 09:10 Close: 2024-04-03 09:30 So from April 1 to April 3. Let's compute that: April 1 start at 9:10, end on April 3rd at 9:30. That's two days and two hours 20 minutes. Total hours: 2*24 + 2.33 = 50.33 hours. Case 2004: Submit: 2024-04-01 09:20 Close: 2024-04-01 10:45. That's just 1 hour 25 minutes. Very quick. Case 2005: Submit: 2024-04-01 09:25 Close: 2024-04-04 14:30 So starting April 1st and ending April 4th. Let's compute: From April 1 09:25 to April 4 14:30 is 3 days and 5 hours 5 minutes. Total hours: 77 hours approximately."

But how much is significantly longer? Let's see the average. The shortest is around 1.5 hours, the next is 26 hours, then 50, then 77. The difference between 2001 and 2002 is a day, so maybe cases that take more than a day are considered problematic. But maybe even 26 hours is over a day. Let's see the process steps. Wait, maybe I should consider the process steps and see where the delays are. Let's look at each case's activities."

Case 2002: Submit 9:05 AM April 1, Close 11:00 AM April 2. That's 24 hours minus 9:05 + 22 hours 55 minutes? Wait, 9:05 to 11:00 next day: from 9:05 to 9:05 next day is 24h, then another 1h55m. So total 25h55m? Wait, maybe better to compute the exact difference. The difference between April 2nd 11:00 and April 1st 9:05 is (24 - 9.083) + 11.0 (since 9:05 is 9 + 5/60 hours 9.0833). Wait, better to compute in hours: April 1 9:05 to April 2 11:00 is 25 hours 55 minutes. So 25.92 hours. Case 2003: submit 9:10, close on April 3 at 9:30 AM. The time from start to end: April 1 to April 3 is 2 days, 9:30 -9:10 is 20 minutes. So total is 2 days and 20 minutes. That's 48h20m, but wait, let's compute exact: April 1 9:10 to April 3 9:30 is 48 hours plus 20 minutes. So 48.33 hours. Case 2005: Submit 9:25 on April 1, closes on April 4 at 14:30. From 9:25 to 14:30 is 3 days and 5 hours 5 minutes. So total: April 1 9:25 to April 4 09:25 is exactly 3 days (72 hours). Then from 09:25 to 14:30 on the 4th is 5 hours 5 minutes. Total: 72 + 5.083 (5h5m is 5.083 hours) so total 77.08 hours. Okay, so the durations are: 2001: 1.5h 2002: ~25.9h 2003: ~50.5h 2004: 1.4h 2005: ~77h Comparing these, Cases 2002, 2003, 2005 are longer. Cases 2001 and 2004 are normal. So the first task is to identify which are significantly longer. Since 25 hours is over a day, and 50 is 2 days, and 77 is over 3 days. The others are under 2 hours. So the significantly longer ones are 2002, 2003, 2005."

Hmm, that's a big jump. - 2003: Complexity High, 50h - 2004: Low, quick. - 2005: High, 77h. So higher complexity is related to longer durations.

Case 2002 (Region B, Complexity Medium): Activities: Submit (CSR_Paul) Evaluate (Adjuster_Lisa) Then Request Additional Docs (Adjuster_Lisa at 14:00 on April 1, then Approve on April 2. Wait, the Request Additional Docs is only once here, on April 1 14:00. Then the next activity is Approve on the next day at 10:00. That's a 20-hour gap between the Request Additional Docs and Approve. Maybe because they had to wait for the docs, but the submitter was in B? Not sure yet. Case 2003 (Region A, High): Activities: After Evaluate (April 1 09:40), then Request Docs at 11:00 and again at 17:00 (same day).

Wait, between the last Request Docs at 17:00 on April 1 and the Approve on April 3 at 16:00, there's a gap. That's two days minus a few hours. So maybe the Approve was delayed? Case 2005 (Region B, High complexity): Has multiple Request Docs steps. Let's see: Activities: Submit, Evaluate, then Request Docs on April 1 11:30, then again on April 2 17:00, then again on April 3 15:00. Then Approve on April 4 10:00.

    "Text": "Additionally, perhaps the Approve step is delayed. Let's look at the steps in detail for each case to see where the delays occur. Starting with Case 2001 (Low complexity, quick): No Request Docs, so after Evaluate, they go straight to Approve. So that's quick. Case2002 (Medium complexity, 26h duration): They had 1 Request Docs. The steps are: Submit -> Evaluate (took 40 minutes?), then Request Docs (at 14:00), so from Evaluate (09:45 start) to Request Docs at 14:00, which is 4h15m. Then after Request Docs, the next step is Approve on April 2 at 10:00. So from the Request Docs (April 1 14:00) to Approve on April 2 10:00 is 20 hours (next day). So that's a 20-hour delay? Maybe the documents took time to come in, and then the Approve can't happen until they get the docs. So the time between the last Request and Approve could be part of the delay. Similarly, for 2003 and 2005, the multiple requests mean more back-and-forth, each adding delays. For case2003 (High complexity, 50h): They have two Request Docs steps on the same day (April 1 at 10:00 and 17:00). Wait, same day. Wait, the first Request Docs is at 10 AM, then another at 5 PM same day, so maybe they needed to send another request after the first one wasn't sufficient? That's odd. Maybe the first Request was sent, but then maybe the documents weren't sufficient, so another request was made same day. But then the Approve is only done on April 2nd at 16:00. So from the second Request at 17:00 on the 1st, to Approve on 2nd 16:00 is 23 hours. So again, a long wait. Case2005 (High, 77h): Three Request Docs steps: April1 11:30, April2 17:00, April3 15:00. Then Approve on April4 10:00. So after each Request, they have to wait until the next Request, then finally Approve. Each Request adds time."

Case2005's Adjuster_Lisa (maybe Lisa again? Let me see: Looking at case2005's Adjuster for Request Docs: Case2005 has three Request Docs entries, all by Adjuster_Lisa (assuming that's the name).

High complexity has more requests, leading to longer total time. - The number of Request Docs steps directly contributes to longer durations. Additionally, perhaps in Region B, even though the Approve is done by the same Manager, the delays are longer, maybe due to more steps, but it's possible that in Region B, there's something else. Alternatively, the case2005 (Region B, High) has three Requests, which is more than 2003's two, hence contributing to longer time. So the root causes are: 1. High complexity cases require more document requests, each adding time between steps (customer response time). 2. The number of Requests is driven by the complexity. So complexity is the main root cause, but perhaps also the region's customer response time. Alternatively, looking at the time between each step for the Request Docs: For case2003: Between the two Request Docs steps on April1: first at 10 AM, next at 5 PM. So only a few hours between them, but then 23h until Approve. Hmm. Another angle: the time between the Approve and Pay steps. Wait, after the last Request Docs, the Approve is after a delay. The Approver (Manager_Mike) might be delayed in approving after the last Request. Alternatively, maybe the Manager has to handle more, leading to backlogs. Alternatively, perhaps in case2005, the three Requests took longer because of the number of requests. So, the main root causes are: - Complexity: Higher complexity leads to more"
