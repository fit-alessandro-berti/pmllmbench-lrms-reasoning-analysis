Looking at the sequences: In Case 1: After TST (11:00), they do RT (11:20), then TST again (11:40). So RT leads back to TST. Case 3 has multiple IQC steps. IQC is in-line quality check, which seems to be done multiple times (after AS each time?). Case 4 skips IQC and RT entirely, so it's a direct path. Case 5 has a loop of RT and TST: TST RT TST RT TST."

Then AS (Assembly) but after AS, sometimes there's IQC (In-line Quality Check) which may repeat, then another AS, etc. 5. After some IQC steps, they do TST (Testing) 6. If TST fails, they do RT (Re-Testing), which leads back to TST 7. Once TST passes, they go to PK (Packaging), LB (Labeling, which may be skipped), DP (Distribution Planning), and D (Dispatch)"

Wait, the loop is defined as executing A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. Wait, the problem states: a loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by * ( A, B ) and tells that you execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again, repeating until the loop is exited. Hmm, so the structure is: A (B A)* exit. Wait, but in the example given in the problem statement: the loop is between A and B, so the sequence is A, then either exit or do B followed by A again. Hmm, this is a bit confusing."

In this case, the loop would generate AS IQC AS IQC ... AS (exit). Which matches the logs. For example, in Case 3: after the initial AS (after QS), they do IQC, then AS again, then IQC, then AS again, etc., until they do AS (the last one) and then move to TST. Yes, this seems to fit.

So the order is: After QS, you do the AS loop (loop1), then TST (the first TST), then the TST loop (loop2) which may repeat TST and RT. Wait, but loop2 is * (TST, RT), so it starts with TST. Hmm, but in the logs, the TST is done once (the first time), then if RT is done, it goes back to TST. Wait, perhaps the initial TST is not a separate node but part of the loop2. Yes, because the loop2 starts with TST. So the structure is: after loop1 (AS/IQC), the next step is loop2 (TST RT TST ...), then PK."
