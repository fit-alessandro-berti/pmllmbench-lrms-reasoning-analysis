Actually doctor consultation for 45 M is at 13: timestamp 08:23:10 activity Doctor consultation, resource Dr. Lee, department ER, patient_age 45, diagnosis hairline fracture. So that belongs to same case. Also X-ray at 08:15:42 is for patient 45 M. So case includes events 1,4,7,13,15. For 62 F: events 2 (register), 5 (triage), 8 (lab test requested), 10 (lab test completed), 12 (doctor consultation), 14 (prescription), 17 (discharge). Also maybe other events? Yes. For 28 M: events 3 (register), 6 (doctor consultation scheduled knee surgery), 9 (surgery preparation), 13 (surgery performed), 16 (recovery room), 18 (discharge). Also maybe initial triage? No triage not present for surgery case; they go directly to doctor consultation."
