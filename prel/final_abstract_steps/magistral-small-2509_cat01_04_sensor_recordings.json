    "Text": "Now lets go through the events one by one and see if we can spot patterns Event 13 Temperature 20C Pressure 1 bar Vibration 0 Hz Material Flow 0 Tool Position 0 mm Energy 045 kWh This looks like the machine is idle or in a standby state Temperature and vibration are low no material flow tool is at 0 position and energy consumption is low Event 46 Temperature increases from 50 to 58C Pressure steady at 15 bar Vibration increases from 30 to 38 Hz Material Flow steady at 5 unitss Tool Position increases from 5 to 10 mm Energy increases from 200 to 300 kWh Here we see a significant increase in temperature vibration material flow and energy This could indicate a mechanical process like cutting or assembling where the machine is actively working The increasing temperature and vibration suggest mechanical work possibly cutting or welding The material flow suggests that material is being processed Event 78 Temperature steady at 40C Pressure steady at 2 bar Vibration low at 10 Hz Material Flow reduced to 2 unitss Tool Position steady at 15 mm Energy steady at 200 kWh This seems like a different phase Temperature and pressure are moderate vibration is low material flow is reduced and energy is lower than the previous phase This could be a transition phase or a different activity like assembling where the machine is not under as much stress Event 9 Temperature spikes to 80C Pressure 2 bar Vibration 50 Hz Material Flow 0 Tool Position steady at 15 mm Energy spikes to 500 kWh This is a significant spike in temperature and vibration with no material flow This could indicate a highenergy process like welding which typically involves high heat and vibration but no material movement Event 1012 Temperature decreases to 2530C Pressure 1 bar Vibration low at 15 Hz Material Flow low at 01 unitss Tool Position increases to 20 mm Energy moderate at 100160 kWh This seems like a cooling down or inspection phase Temperature is moderate vibration is low material flow is minimal and energy is low This could be quality inspection or a preparation for the next step Event 1315 Similar to events 13 indicating the machine is back to idle or standby"

    "Text": "Now lets assign labels and rationales 1 IdleStandby Rationale Low temperature no vibration no material flow low energy The machine is not actively processing anything 2 Cutting Metal Rationale High vibration increasing temperature and material flow Cutting typically involves high mechanical stress leading to vibration and heat 3 Assembling Parts Rationale Moderate temperature and pressure low vibration steady tool position moderate material flow Assembling might involve steady less stressful operations with some material movement 4 Welding Rationale Very high temperature and vibration no material flow high energy Welding involves intense heat and vibration without material movement 5 Quality Inspection Rationale Moderate temperature low vibration minimal material flow moderate energy Inspection is typically a less active phase with low energy consumption"
