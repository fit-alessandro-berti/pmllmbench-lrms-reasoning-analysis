For instance, IQC can repeat, and RT can cause the process to go back to TST. LB is optional, meaning in some cases it's skipped."

Looking back, the logs show IQC is often repeated with AS in between, but AS is also repeated after IQC. So perhaps the IQC loop includes AS as part of the loop. So, IQC, AS, IQC, AS, etc., until TST passes."
