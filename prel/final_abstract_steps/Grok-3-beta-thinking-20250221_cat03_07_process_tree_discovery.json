Some cases have repetitions of RMI and VF, which suggests there's a loop in the process."

    "Text": "Wait, actually, looking closer, in case 1, after AE, there's RMI, then VF again, and then AD. In case 2, there's no RMI, so it goes directly from AE to AD. In case 3, there are two RMIs before going to AD. So, it seems like after AE, there can be zero or more iterations of RMI followed by VF, and then the process continues to AD, SC, and AC."

Wait, maybe the loop is such that after AE, you can do a sequence of RMI followed by VF, and this can be repeated multiple times, but in the log, it's only done once. Alternatively, perhaps it's a loop around RMI and VF, but the log shows multiple RMIs before VF."

    "Text": "Yes, so it works. For trace 2: RA → VF → AE → tau → AD → SC → AC, and since tau is silent, the visible trace is RA → VF → AE → AD → SC → AC, which matches trace 2. For trace 1: RA → VF → AE → -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) → AD → SC → AC, and within * (RMI, tau), it can do RMI once and exit, so -> ( RMI, VF ). For trace 3: similarly, within * (RMI, tau), it can do RMI → tau → RMI, but since tau is silent, it's effectively RMI → RMI, then exit, so they all match."
