Therefore, the first can be called 'Initial Identity Verification' and the second 'Re-Verify Identity Documentation' or something like that... Alternatively, based on context: The first context is 'checks identity documents' but it was incomplete, so they had to make a call.

Justifications for naming choices: For C001's 'Initial Identity Verification' captures the first verification step, while 'Re-Verification of ID After Submission' indicates it's after the customer provided additional documents, hence the recheck. In C002, 'Clarify Discrepancy Call' reflects the need to address a discrepancy, whereas 'Follow-Up Confirmation Call' satisfies the post-adjustment confirmation. For C003, 'Initial Physical ID Verification' specifies it was part of the in-person visit, while 'Post-Adjustment Document Recheck' highlights the necessity to check docs again after internal adjustments. This way, each renamed activity's name clearly communicates its role in the case process and distinguishes it from other activities with the same original name occurring elsewhere in the same case."
