Or maybe it's the other way around? Wait the key is the activity that must be responded to, and the target is the response.

The response constraint is that A must be followed by B. Wait, the 'response' constraint in DECLARE typically means that every occurrence of A must be followed by at least one occurrence of B.

The succession constraint (from what I recall) requires that if A occurs, then B must occur after it, but not necessarily immediately.
