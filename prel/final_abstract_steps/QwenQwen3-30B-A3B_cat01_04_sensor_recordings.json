    "Text": "Looking at the first few events (1-3), the temperature is around 20C, pressure is 1 bar, vibration is 0, material flow is 0, tool position is 0, and energy is 0.50. Then at event 4, temperature jumps to 50C, pressure increases to 1.5 bar, vibration goes up to 30 Hz, material flow is 5 units/s, tool position is 5 mm, and energy is 2.00. That seems like a significant change. Then events 5 and 6 show increasing temperature, pressure, vibration, and tool position, while energy increases as well. Then at event 7, temperature drops to 40C, pressure increases to 2 bar, vibration drops to 10 Hz, material flow decreases to 2 units/s, tool position is 15 mm, energy is 2.00. Then events 8 is similar to 7. Event 9 has a big jump in temperature to 80C, pressure stays at 2, vibration spikes to 50 Hz, material flow drops to 0, tool position remains 15, energy jumps to 5.00. Then event 10 drops temperature to 30, pressure back to 1, vibration to 1, material flow 0, tool position 15, energy 1.00. Then events 11-13 show temperature going back to 20s, pressure 1, vibration 0, material flow 0, tool position 0, energy 0.50 again."

Maybe that's \"Assembling Parts\" where the machine is moving parts together without high vibration. Then event 9 is a spike in temperature and vibration, which might be \"Welding\" since welding requires high heat.

Lower temperature, higher pressure, moderate vibration, lower material flow. Maybe assembling parts where the machine is putting components together without high vibration.\n4. Welding: Event 9. Very high temperature and vibration, no material flow. Welding requires high heat and might have high vibration.\n5. Shutdown/Cooling: Events 10-12.

    "Text": "But I need to make sure that the grouping makes sense. Let me check each group's sensor readings.\nFor Cutting (4-6): Temperature increases from 50 to 58, pressure from 1 to 1.5, vibration 30 to 38, material flow 5, tool position 5-10 mm. Energy increases from 2 to 3. This seems like an active cutting process.\nAssembling (7-8): Temperature drops to 40, pressure increases to 2, vibration drops to 10, material flow 2, tool position 15. Energy is 2.00. Maybe the machine is moving parts into place, which requires some pressure but less vibration.\nWelding (9): Temperature jumps to 80, vibration 50, material flow 0, tool position 15, energy 5.00. High energy and vibration, which is typical for welding.\nThen after that, the machine cools down (events 10-13): temperature drops to 30, then back to 20s, pressure and vibration low, material flow 0. So that's probably a cooldown or shutdown phase."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the rationale for each label:\n\n- Idle/Setup: Low values across all sensors, no activity, machine is not in operation.\n- Cutting Metal: High temperature and vibration, increasing energy, material flow, and tool movement. These are typical signs of cutting operations where the tool is actively removing material.\n- Assembling Parts: Moderate temperature, higher pressure, lower vibration, and some material flow. This could indicate the machine is assembling components without high mechanical stress.\n- Welding: Extremely high temperature and vibration, no material flow, and high energy consumption. This aligns with welding processes that require intense heat.\n- Cooling/Shutdown: Gradual decrease in temperature and energy, returning to baseline values, indicating the machine is either cooling down or being shut down after a high-energy process."
