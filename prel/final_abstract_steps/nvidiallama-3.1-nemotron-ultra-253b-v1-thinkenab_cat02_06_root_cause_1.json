So from day 1 8:05 to day 2 9:15. That's roughly 25 hours and 10 minutes. That's way longer. Case 103: 8:10 to 9:30 same day. 1 hour 20 minutes. Fast. Case 104: 8:20 on 3/1 to 8:30 on 3/2. So about 24 hours and 10 minutes. Also a day. Case 105: 8:25 on 3/1 to 9:30 on 3/3. That's two days and about 1 hour. So over 48 hours. Wow, that's really long."

    "Text": "So the average resolution time... Let's calculate each case's duration. Case 101: 2.25 hours Case 102: 25.17 hours (from 8:05 to next day 9:15 is 25h10m) Case 103: 1.33 hours Case 104: 24.17 hours (from 8:20 to next day 8:30 is 24h10m) Case 105: 49.08 hours (from 8:25 to 3/3 9:30 is 49h5m) Average would be (2.25 +25.17 +1.33 +24.17 +49.08)/5 = (101)/5 = 20.2 hours. So cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average. But 105 is way higher. So these three are the ones with longer times."

    "Text": "Now, why are these taking longer? Let's look at their activities. Case 102: Had an escalation to Level-2 Agent. The timeline shows that after Assign to Level-1, it escalated at 11:30, then Investigate at 14:00 same day, but Resolve was next day at 9:00. So the time from Escalate to Investigate is 2.5 hours, but then from Investigate to Resolve is overnight. Wait, the Investigate happened on 3/1 at 14:00, but Resolve was 3/2 at 9:00. So that's 19 hours. Maybe the Level-2 team took a long time. Case 104: No escalation. Let's see. Received at 8:20, Triage at 9:00 (40 min), Assign at 9:30 (30 min), then Investigate at 13:00 (3.5 hours later). Then Resolve at next day 8:00, so Investigate to Resolve is 19 hours. Then Close at 8:30. So the long wait between Assign and Investigate (3.5h), and between Investigate and Resolve (19h). Why the delay after investigation? Case 105: Escalated to Level-2. Let's see. Received to Triage: 10 min, Triage to Assign: 25 min. Assign to Investigate: 10 min. Then Escalate at 10:00. Then next Investigate is 3/2 at 14:00. So from Escalate to next Investigate is 1 day and 4 hours. Then Resolve at 3/3 9:00, so Investigate to Resolve is 19 hours. Then Close at 9:30. So the escalation caused a huge delay. The Level-2 team took a long time to pick up the investigation, and then another day to resolve."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Possible root causes: 1. Escalation to Level-2 Agent leads to significant delays. Maybe the Level-2 team is understaffed or has a backlog, causing long waiting times. 2. Long waiting times between activities. For example, in case 104, after assigning to Level-1, it took 3.5 hours to start investigation, and then 19 hours to resolve. Maybe the Level-1 agents are overloaded, or there's a handoff delay. 3. Investigation to Resolve step takes a long time, especially when escalated. Could be that complex issues require more time, but maybe there's a lack of collaboration or resources for the Level-2 team. 4. Overnight delays: Some steps are left until the next day, suggesting that work is not being continued beyond certain hours, leading to idle time."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Recommendations: - Analyze the workload and capacity of Level-2 teams. Maybe they need more resources or better prioritization. - Implement escalation protocols that include SLAs (Service Level Agreements) to ensure timely handling of escalated tickets. - Investigate why investigation steps are taking so long. Maybe agents need more training, better tools, or access to information. - Identify bottlenecks in the handoff between activities, especially after assignment or escalation. Streamline the process or automate notifications to ensure timely action. - Consider extending support hours or having an on-call system to handle critical issues outside regular working hours, reducing idle time."
