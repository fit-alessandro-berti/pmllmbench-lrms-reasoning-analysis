Maybe priority orders are handled differently, but according to the assumed process, even priority should follow the steps. Alternatively, a misconfiguration or oversight. Case 1003: Missing Validate Stock. Maybe the stock was already confirmed earlier, but the system didn't log it? Or the step was skipped. Case 1004: The order was received, then payment was received before invoice. That's impossible unless the payment was a deposit or pre-payment, but according to the process, invoice should come before payment. So that's a clear process violation.
