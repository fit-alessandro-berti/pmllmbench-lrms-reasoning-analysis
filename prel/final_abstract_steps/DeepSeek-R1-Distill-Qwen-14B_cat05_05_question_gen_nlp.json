    "Text": "Alright the process starts with RD teams designing new smartphones Then they get components from various international suppliersTaiwan for microprocessors Japan for camera modules South Korea for OLED screens and others from Germany and the US Each supplier has different lead times quality metrics and contracts These components are shipped to the main assembly plant in Malaysia where theyre assembled 247 with both workers and automated machinery After assembly the phones are quality checked tested and then packed Theyre sent to regional distribution centers via different transport methodssome by air some by sea They work with logistics partners for customs insurance etc High demand markets get just in time replenishment while slower ones use aggregated monthly shipments to save costs Once in regional centers the products are broken down into smaller shipments and sent to retailers e commerce centers and sometimes directly to consumers Throughout the process planners track inventory adjust orders based on sales forecasts Theres a focus on quality assurance compliance warranties after sales support and continuous improvement to cut lead times costs and carbon footprint They use digital systems for orders invoices customs production and demand planning Analytics and machine learning help with inventory and forecasting"
