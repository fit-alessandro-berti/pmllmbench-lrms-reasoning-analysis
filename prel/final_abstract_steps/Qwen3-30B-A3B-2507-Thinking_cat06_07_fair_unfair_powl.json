The initial step of receiving the application is not explicitly modeled as an activity, but we'll start from the data check. We'll define the following activities (as Transition objects): - DataCompletenessCheck: for the initial data check (which may trigger a loop for missing info) - RequestMoreInfo: to be used in the loop for missing data - SkillAssessment: the online skill test - CulturalFitCheck: standard cultural fit evaluation - CommunityAffiliationCheck: the activity that gives a subtle advantage for community affiliation (only in the unfair model) - ManagerialReview: for borderline candidates - FinalDecision: the final hiring decision"

We start with the application being processed (we don't have an explicit ReceiveApplication in the description, so we start from DataCompletenessCheck). 2. The DataCompletenessCheck will either be passed (and move to SkillAssessment) or if incomplete, it will trigger a loop (with RequestMoreInfo) until complete. 3. After SkillAssessment, we have a branching for the cultural fit part."

But in the POWL model, we don't have conditions on data. We are modeling the process structure. The condition (affiliation) would be a condition on the data, but the POWL model is about the workflow structure. We are told that the process has an XOR choice: either standard cultural fit or the community branch. So we model the XOR with two children: one for the standard cultural fit (CulturalFitCheck) and one for the CommunityAffiliationCheck."

However, in the workflow, the branch is determined by the data (which we don't model in the structure). The POWL model we are to draw is the structural workflow, so we have the two branches. Important: The unfairness comes from the fact that the CommunityAffiliationCheck branch leads to a subtle advantage. So in the model, we have the XOR with two branches. 4.

So the loop is: DataCompletenessCheck -> if incomplete, then RequestMoreInfo -> then DataCompletenessCheck again?
