First, we define the necessary activities (as Transition objects) from the process description: - DataCompletenessCheck: for the initial data check (which may trigger a loop for missing info) - RequestMoreInfo: to be used in the loop for missing data - SkillAssessment: the online skill test - CulturalFitCheck: standard cultural fit evaluation - CommunityAffiliationCheck: the activity that gives a subtle advantage for community affiliation (only in the unfair model) - ManagerialReview: for borderline candidates - FinalDecision: the final hiring decision"

    "Text": "Steps for both models: 1. We start with the application being processed (we dont have an explicit ReceiveApplication in the description, so we start from DataCompletenessCheck). 2. The DataCompletenessCheck will either be passed (and move to SkillAssessment) or if incomplete, it will trigger a loop (with RequestMoreInfo) until complete. 3. After SkillAssessment, we have a branching for the cultural fit part."

    "Text": "For the first model (with unfairness): - After SkillAssessment, we have an XOR branch: Option 1: CulturalFitCheck (standard) Option 2: CommunityAffiliationCheck (which gives a subtle advantage) However, note: the description says that the CommunityAffiliationCheck is a branch that is taken if the applicant is affiliated with a known local group. But in the POWL model, we dont have conditions on data. We are modeling the process structure. The condition (affiliation) would be a condition on the data, but the POWL model is about the workflow structure. We are told that the process has an XOR choice: either standard cultural fit or the community branch. So we model the XOR with two children: one for the standard cultural fit (CulturalFitCheck) and one for the CommunityAffiliationCheck. Important: The unfairness comes from the fact that the CommunityAffiliationCheck branch leads to a subtle advantage. So in the model, we have the XOR with two branches. 4. Then, after either branch, we go to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision."

    "Text": "However, note: the description says that the CulturalFitCheck (standard) and CommunityAffiliationCheck are two different paths. But the CommunityAffiliationCheck might be a short path that leads to a higher score? The model doesnt capture the score adjustment, just the fact that there is a different activity. But note: the description says that the CommunityAffiliationCheck is a step that gives a subtle uplift. So we model it as a separate activity."

    "Text": "Note: We dont have a RequestMoreInfo activity that is used in the loop. Well model the loop as: Loop: * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ) -> but note: the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo? Actually, the description says: if the resume is incomplete, the applicant is asked to provide additional details (which we model as RequestMoreInfo) and then after that, we go back to check data completeness? So the loop is: DataCompletenessCheck -> if incomplete, then RequestMoreInfo -> then DataCompletenessCheck again? But the loop operator in POWL is defined as * (A, B) meaning: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. However, note: the loop operator in POWL is defined as: * (A, B) means: do A, then if you want to continue, do B and then A again. But in our case, we want to do DataCompletenessCheck, and if its incomplete, we do RequestMoreInfo, and then we go back to DataCompletenessCheck? Actually, the loop is: [DataCompletenessCheck] -> (if incomplete) -> [RequestMoreInfo] -> [DataCompletenessCheck] (again) So the loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo, but note the order: we start with A (DataCompletenessCheck). If complete, we exit. If not, we do B (RequestMoreInfo) and then we go back to A (so we do A again). So the loop is * (A, B) with A being DataCompletenessCheck and B being RequestMoreInfo. However, note: the loop operator in POWL is defined as * (A, B) meaning: A, then (B, then A) repeated. So: A -> (B -> A) -> (B -> A) ... until we dont take the B branch. So the loop structure is: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) But note: the loop is a single node that represents the loop. So well create a loop node for the data completeness."

    "Text": "Now, for the two models: Model 1: With Unfairness Steps: 1. Loop for data completeness: * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) 2. After the loop (i.e., when data is complete), we go to SkillAssessment. 3. After SkillAssessment, we have an XOR: one branch is CulturalFitCheck, the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck. 4. Then, regardless of the branch, we go to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision. So the structure: root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, skill_assessment, xor_branch, managerial_review, final_decision]) But note: the XOR branch is a single node (OperatorPOWL) that has two children. We need to set the order: - The loop must be completed before SkillAssessment. - SkillAssessment must be completed before the XOR branch (because the XOR is taken after SkillAssessment). - The XOR branch (which is the two activities) must be completed before ManagerialReview. - ManagerialReview must be completed before FinalDecision. We can model: nodes = [loop, skill_assessment, xor_branch, managerial_review, final_decision] order: loop --> skill_assessment skill_assessment --> xor_branch xor_branch --> managerial_review managerial_review --> final_decision But note: the XOR branch is a single node (OperatorPOWL) that has two children (CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck). The XOR node itself is a single activity in the graph (it represents the choice). So we dont break it into two separate nodes. So we define: xor_branch = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck]) Then the order edges: loop -> skill_assessment skill_assessment -> xor_branch xor_branch -> managerial_review managerial_review -> final_decision"

Lets write the code accordingly. Important: The POWL model must be built with the classes from pm4py. Well import the necessary classes. Note: The example provided in the instructions uses: from pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator Well do the same. Lets code for Model 1 (with unfairness) and Model 2 (without unfairness)."
