Thus, for the given sequence of activities `SS`, `OP`, `RC`, `QI`, `CA`, `PT`, `PK`, `WS`, `DT`, `AS`, we need to make pairs such that the first activity appears before the second one in the given sequence."

    "Text": "1. Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP): This might typically take a few days because once a supplier is selected, an order can usually be placed within a day or two. Let us assume an average of 2 days, which is `2 * 86400 = 172800` seconds. A standard deviation might be half a day (i.e., `12 * 3600 = 43200` seconds), which is `0.5 * 86400 = 43200` seconds. 2. SS to Receive Components (RC): This might take a few days to a few weeks. Assume that after an order is placed, it might take on average a week (7 days) until the components are received. Thus, `7 * 86400 = 604800` seconds might be a reasonable average time. A standard deviation could be 1 day (i.e., `86400` seconds)."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "This reasoning should be continued until the `(WS, DT)` and `(WS, AS)`, and `(DT, AS)` pairs are also defined. However, a few more pairs should be defined explicitly here such as: Receive Components (RC) to Quality Inspection (QI): Quality inspection should be done almost immediately after receiving components. So, assume an average of `1 * 86400 = 86400` seconds (1 day) with a standard deviation of half a day (i.e., `43200` seconds)."
