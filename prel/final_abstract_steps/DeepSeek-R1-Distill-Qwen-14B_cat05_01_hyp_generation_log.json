That's out of order because Confirm Shipment should come after Validate Stock and before Ship Goods.\n- Then, Event 10: Ship Goods (Logistics) – but Credit Check hasn't happened yet.\n- Event 11: Credit Check (Finance) – this should have been step 2, but it's happening after shipping.\n- Event 12: Validate Stock (Warehouse) – again, this should have been step 3 but is happening later.\n- Event 13: Issue Invoice (Finance) – comes after all steps, but the Credit Check and Stock Validation are out of order.\n- Event 14: Receive Payment (Finance) – seems correct.\n\nSo, for case 1002, the Credit Check and Validate Stock steps are happening after shipping, which isn't the normal flow. That's an anomaly."

That's a problem because Validate Stock should come before shipping.\n- Event 18: Issue Invoice (Finance) – correct.\n- Event 19: Confirm Shipment (Logistics) – but this is after shipping, which is unusual because Confirm Shipment is usually before shipping.\n- Event 20: Receive Payment (Finance) – correct.\n\nSo, case 1003 has issues: Validate Stock is missing or happening after shipping, and Confirm Shipment is after shipping."

I'll need to join the order_event_log with the resources and orders tables to get more context.\n\nFirst query: Identify cases where the event sequence doesn't follow the expected order. I can do this by checking the sequence of activities and their order.\n\nSecond query: Identify cases where critical steps like Credit Check or Validate Stock are missing or out of order.\n\nThird query: Check for cases where payment is received before the invoice is issued."
