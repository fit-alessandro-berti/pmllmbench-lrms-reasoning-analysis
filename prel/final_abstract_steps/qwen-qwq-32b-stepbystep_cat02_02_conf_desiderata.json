    "Text": "First, I need to recall the normative constraints. The key points here are the sequence must be followed exactly. Let me note them again: The correct sequence is: Application  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  Then, if approved, do Finalize Docs before closing. If rejected, close without docs. Also, the ordering rules are Credit Check before Risk, Risk before Decision, Inform after Decision, and Finalize only if approved, and only then before closing."

The activities are in order: Application at 9:00, then Credit Check at 9:30, Risk at 10:00, Decision (approved) at 11, Inform at 13:00, then Finalize Docs at 13:30, Close at 14:00. Does this follow all the strict rules? The sequence looks correct. Credit Check before Risk, Risk before Decision, Inform after Decision. Since it's approved, Finalize is done before closing. So Case 1 seems okay."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 2 starts with Application at 8:00, then the next step is Risk Assessment at 8:20 but before the Credit Check. That's a problem because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a normative violation. Next, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. Because if rejected, you shouldn't finalize docs. So that's another normative violation. So Case 2 has two normative issues: wrong order (Risk before Credit Check), and Finalize after Rejection."

    "Text": "Case 3: The first issue is Credit Check happening 2 days later (Application on Jan 12, Credit Check on Jan 14). The desiderata says Credit Check should be within 24 hours, so that's a desideratum violation, not a normative one. Then, the Inform Applicant is on the 16th, which is more than 48 hours after the Decision (Decision was on the 14th at 12:00, so 48 hours would be up to Jan 16 12:00. The Inform is at 15:00 on the 16th, which is 2 days and 3 hours, so just over. But the desiderata says within 48 hours, so that's another desideratum issue. Also, there's no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum."

The example in the log for Case3 has no Follow-up, so that's a desideratum. But for Case1, the log doesn't have it either... Since the problem says 'the event log' lists all the activities, so if it's not listed, they didn't do it. Therefore, all three cases might have the missing Follow-up."

    "Text": "Wait, looking at the log for Case2: After Loan Decision (Rejected at 9:30), the next activity is Finalize Docs at 10:00, but the Inform step is missing? Wait, the log shows for Case2: After Loan Decision (Rejected) at 9:30, the next entry is Finalize Docs at 10:00, but according to the normative steps, after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant before proceeding. So in Case2, they skipped the Inform step entirely? That's a normative violation because they skipped a required step."

Finalizing Docs after Rejection."

The Finalize Docs after rejection might be a mistake. The missing Inform is critical. Possible justification: maybe staff was in a rush, leading to wrong order and missing steps. For Case3's delays: backlogs, system delays, etc."
