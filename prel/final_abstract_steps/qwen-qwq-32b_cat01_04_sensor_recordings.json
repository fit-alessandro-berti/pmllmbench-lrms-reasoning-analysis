Looking for clusters: Events 4-6: High temp, high vibration, material flow 5. Could be Cutting since high temp and vibration during cutting metal. The high material flow (5 units/s) might be feeding material into a cutting tool. The tool position is increasing, maybe moving the cutting tool."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Maybe cutting or some process that requires more energy and movement. The temperature and vibration are higher, so perhaps a cutting operation where the tool is moving (tool position increasing) and using more energy. The material flow here is 5, which might be raw material being fed into the process. Label: Cutting Metal (4-6)."
