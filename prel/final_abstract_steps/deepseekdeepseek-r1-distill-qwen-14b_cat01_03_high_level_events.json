    "Text": "I notice that these events can be divided into distinct phases. The first few events (1-5) are about getting the material ready. Then, events 6-8 are about welding, which seems like assembly. After that, 9 is a quality check, and 10-11 are about applying a coating, which could be a finishing step. Finally, 12 is a visual check, which is another quality assurance step."

Quality Inspection: Measuring weld integrity and visual check. 4. Coating Application: Applying and drying the coating."
