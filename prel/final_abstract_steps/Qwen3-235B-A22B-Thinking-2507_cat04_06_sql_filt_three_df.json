Also, case 1 is excluded. So the result should have case 2 and case 3. Now, in the sequence_events for case 1: row1: activity = Approve, next_activity = Create Order, next_next_activity = Confirm Order, create_order_time = 2023-01-02, confirm_order_time = 2023-01-08 time_diff = 6 days condition met. So case 1 is in cases_to_exclude. Similarly, for case 4, the first three events form the sequence and the time diff is 6 days excluded. For case 2: row1: activity = Approve, next_activity = Create Order, next_next_activity = Confirm Order, time_diff = 4 days condition not met. So case 2 is not in cases_to_exclude. For case 3: row1: activity = Approve, next_activity = Something Else doesnt match, so skip. row2: activity = Something Else, next_activity = Create Order, next_next_activity = Confirm Order but the sequence we are looking for starts with Approve, so row2 is not the start. So no row in case 3 meets the condition. Therefore, the query should work."

Then, because we found at least one sequence that meets the condition, we exclude the entire case. So the query is correct. But note: in the sequence_events CTE, for the first row A we get the sequence and the time diff for the first sequence. For the fourth row A again we get the sequence for the second time. If the first sequence meets the condition, then we mark case 5 for exclusion. We dont need to check the second sequence because one is enough. So the DISTINCT in cases_to_exclude is efficient."

    "Text": "One more optimization: we can avoid computing LEAD for all rows by first filtering for the activity Approve Purchase Requisition? But the window function is computed for all rows anyway. Alternatively, we can do: SELECT case_id FROM event_log WHERE activity = Approve Purchase Requisition but then we need the next two events. So we would still need the window function on the entire table? Or we can self-join. But the window function approach is standard and efficient enough for typical event logs. Well stick with the window function."
