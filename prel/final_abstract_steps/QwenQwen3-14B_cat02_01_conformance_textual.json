But wait, the inventory check result isnt specified. The norm says that if inventory is insufficient, you cancel. But in this case, they authorized payment before canceling. That might imply that the inventory was sufficient, but they still canceled. But the problem is that after checking inventory, if its insufficient, you cancel. But if its sufficient, you proceed with payment. However, in this case, they authorized payment and then canceled. The norm says that Cancel order should be after checking inventory when its insufficient. But here, after checking, they went to authorize payment, then cancel. Thats conflicting."

That suggests that maybe the inventory was sufficient, but they decided to cancel. But according to the norm, if inventory is sufficient, you shouldnt cancel. However, the problem is that the process might have an ambiguity here. But according to the norm, the only time you cancel is when inventory is insufficient. So if they canceled after authorizing payment, that would imply that the inventory was sufficient, but they canceled anyway, which is against the process. Alternatively, maybe the inventory check was insufficient, but they authorized payment first. But that would be a violation because the check must be done before payment."

    "Text": "Now, need to check if there are other possible violations. Let me go through each case again. Case 2: The order is Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. So Package is before Authorize payment. The norm says Authorize payment must be after Check inventory and before packaging. So Package should come after Authorize. Therefore, this is a violation. Case 3: After checking inventory, they authorized payment which is allowed if inventory is sufficient, then canceled. But according to the norm, if inventory is sufficient, you dont cancel. However, the norm doesnt mention anything about canceling after payment. But the norm says that when inventory is insufficient, you cancel. If inventory is sufficient, you proceed to payment. However, in this case, they canceled after payment. That might be a deviation because the norm doesnt allow canceling after payment if inventory was sufficient. However, the norm doesnt specify if canceling after payment is allowed, but the key is that the inventory check must be done before payment. In this case, they did check inventory, then authorized payment, then canceled. But according to the norm, after checking, if inventory is sufficient, you proceed with payment, packaging, etc. If they canceled after payment, thats a deviation. Also, after canceling, they shipped, which is a violation. So two violations here. Case 5: They skipped packaging and went straight to shipping. Thats a violation because packaging must happen after payment and before shipping."
