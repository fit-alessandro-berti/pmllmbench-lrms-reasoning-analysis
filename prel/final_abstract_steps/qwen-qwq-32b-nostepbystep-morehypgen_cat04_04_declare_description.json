The DECLARE model has different types like existence, absence, exactly_one, etc. Each of these imposes rules on the activities listed.

The coexistence constraint says that whenever 'Gather_Additional_Documents' happens, 'Authorize_Contract_Terms' must also happen, and vice versa. So those two need to be involved together somewhere."

The exact meaning might be more like they cannot both occur without proper order, but perhaps the noncoexistence is more about mutual exclusion. Alternatively, maybe noncoexistence means they cannot occur in the same case. But since Transfer_Funds is part of the later steps, perhaps noncoexistence here is to prevent Transfer_Funds from happening without going through all steps.

Hmm, this suggests the model might have conflicting constraints, but perhaps I misread the constraint type. Alternatively, maybe 'altprecedence' allows either Notify before Transfer or Transfer before Notify? But the constraints are all set to support 1.0, so they must hold. Wait, the user might have made a mistake, but since it's a given model, perhaps I should proceed with the most logical flow that satisfies most constraints, noting the conflict as a possible error but proceeding."
