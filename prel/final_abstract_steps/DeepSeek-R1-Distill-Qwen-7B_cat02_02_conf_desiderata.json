Everything here follows the sequence perfectly. No skips, order is correct. The timeline seems to follow all the constraints. So, Case 1 is compliant."

Then Credit Check at 09:00 (after Risk Assessment). Loan Decision at 09:30 (rejected). Finalize at 10:00 (which is after rejection, violating the rule that if rejected, don't finalize before closing). Close at 10:30. So, the key issues here are that the Credit Check was done before Risk Assessment, which is not allowed, and Finalize was done after the rejection, which is also not allowed."

That's 5 hours, which is way less than the recommended 24 hours, so that's a desiderata violation. Additionally, the Inform Applicant was done on Jan 16 at 15:00, which is 48 hours after the Loan Decision on Jan 14 at 12:00. The recommended timeframe is within 48 hours, so this is another desiderata violation. Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is another desiderata point. So, Case 3 has multiple desiderata issues but no normative violations."
