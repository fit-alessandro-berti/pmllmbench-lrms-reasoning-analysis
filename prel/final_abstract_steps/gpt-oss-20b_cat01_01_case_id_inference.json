Wait there is also doctor consult at time 08:23:10 by Dr Lee with diagnosis hairline fracture - that's part of this patient's timeline. - Prescription created? Actually prescription created is by Dr Smith for the female patient (#14). So not part of this male's timeline. - Patient discharged So we need confirm no other male aged 45 appears elsewhere - only those events. Good."
