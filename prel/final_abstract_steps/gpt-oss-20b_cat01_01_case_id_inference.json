Wait there is also doctor consult at time 08:23:10 by Dr Lee with diagnosis hairline fracture - that's part of this patient's timeline. - Prescription created? Actually prescription created is by Dr Smith for the female patient (#14). So not part of this male's timeline. - Patient discharged So we need confirm no other male aged 45 appears elsewhere - only those events. Good."

Also mention potential pitfalls like overlapping departments but consistent identity via demographics and timestamps close together relative to others etc. Let's produce final answer accordingly with clear table mapping line numbers -> Case ID -> description maybe include key attributes used for inference such as unique combination of gender/age/time window etc. Also provide summary per case timeline sorted chronologically with activities and timestamps."
