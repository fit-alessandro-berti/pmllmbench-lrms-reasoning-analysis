    "Text": "Let me start by looking at the sample events provided for Cases A1 and B2. First, Ill go through each event in order for a case and see how they flow. Lets take Case A1 first. The first few events are about retrieving a metal sheet, scanning a barcode, placing it on a table, aligning it, and preheating. These all seem to be part of preparing the metal sheet before any actual assembly or processing."

    "Text": "Looking at the B2 case, its almost identical to A1 except for the part number and some timestamps. So the grouping should be consistent across cases."

    "Text": "Hmm, so the initial steps (retrieval, scanning, placement, alignment, preheating) probably form the Material Preparation phase. That makes sense because theyre all about getting the raw material ready. Then, after preheating, they start welding. The welding steps (picking up the tool, welding corners) would be part of the Assembly phase. Then measuring the welds integrity would be Quality Inspection. After that, applying the coating and drying are part of the finishing or Coating Application step."

    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, the visual check is after drying the coating. So maybe after applying the coating and drying, the visual check is a final quality check. So maybe Quality Inspection is split into two parts? Or maybe the visual check is part of the Coating Application step? Hmm, but the coating application and drying are physical steps, while the visual check is a verification step. Maybe its better to have a separate Quality Inspection phase that includes both the weld measurement and the final visual check."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Consider grouping events that are temporally close, performed by the same resource or resource type, or logically follow from each other. Another thing to consider: resources. For example, steps involving Robot Arm 2 (alignment) and Heating Units (preheating and drying) are part of the machines operations, while Operator actions are manual steps. But the high-level steps dont necessarily need to be resource-specific; they just need to group logically."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Let me check the B2 case to see if the grouping holds. The B2 case has the same steps except for the part number and some timestamps, so the grouping should be consistent. This grouping covers all events in both cases. Each step is a distinct phase of the manufacturing process, with clear rationale based on the sequence and purpose of the events."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the sequence is: Material Prep: steps 1-5, Assembly: steps 6-8, Quality Check 1: step 9, Coating Application: steps 10-11, Final Quality Check: step 12. Now, justifying each grouping: Material Preparation: All steps from retrieving the material through preheating. These are necessary before any assembly can begin."
