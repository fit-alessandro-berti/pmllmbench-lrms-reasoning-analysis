Since the task is to disambiguate within the case, I can tailor it per occurrence. For Call Customer: - In C001: Call Customer for Missing Docs - In C002, first: Call Customer for Account Clarification - In C002, second: Follow-up Call Customer for Confirmation - In C003: Call Customer to Recall That might make the names too long, but its okay for clarity."
