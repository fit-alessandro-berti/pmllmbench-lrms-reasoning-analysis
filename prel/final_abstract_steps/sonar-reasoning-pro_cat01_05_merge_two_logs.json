The requirement says to present based on a chosen primary timestampprobably best to use the earliest timestamp between the two to maintain actual occurrence time. For the first merged event, Log Bs timestamp is earlier (09:59:58 vs 10:00:00). If we consider that Log As timestamp is when it was received, the actual event might have occurred earlier (as per Log B). So arranging events in chronological order based on the earliest timestamp would make sense."
