Starting from market research, then RD, splitting into parallel component procurement from different countries.

Then monitoring inventory and adjusting orders or proceeding."

(Why parallel gateway here?) 2. Why secure components from Taiwan, Japan, etc., instead of local suppliers? 3. How does the parallel join after securing components ensure all are ready before shipping? 4. Why ship to Malaysias assembly plant specifically? Location, cost, time? 5. Exclusive gateway decision criteria for quality checkswhat factors determine rework vs scrap? 6. How are decisions at the exclusive gateway communicated to other stakeholders? 7. What risks are mitigated by having parallel component procurement paths? 8. Why use air freight vs cargo ship? Cost, urgency, market demand? 9. How does customs clearance vary by region, and whats the impact on the process? 10. Stakeholder communication during the split distribution phases (local warehousing vs retailers)? 11. Performance metrics for assemblys 24/7 operationefficiency vs worker fatigue? 12. What backup plans exist if a component supplier faces delays or shortages? 13. How does the process handle unexpected regulatory changes in export countries? 14. Why the final step is monitoring inventory and forecasting before next cycle? 15. Decision-making authority at each gatewaycentralized vs decentralized? 16. How are supplier performance measured in securing components on time? 17. Risks of relying on multiple international suppliershow are they managed? 18. The role of parallel gateways in speeding up the process versus potential bottlenecks? 19. How do they ensure quality consistency across different component suppliers? 20. Communication strategies between regional distribution centers and retailers?"

So each question should touch on one of these aspects. Let me make sure each of these areas has questions. Rationale: - Why are components procured in parallel? - Why split at the parallel gateway here? - Why ship to Malaysia? Improvements: - How might the procurement process be optimized? - What alternative distribution methods could be better? Risk Management: - What risks exist in supplier diversification and how are they mitigated? - How are delays in component delivery handled? Decision-making: - What criteria determine the path at the exclusive gateway? - Who decides to proceed to the next sales cycle? Stakeholder communication: - How do teams coordinate between different countriessuppliers? - How are changes in shipping routes communicated? Performance measurement: - What KPIs track the efficiency of the assembly line? - How is the success of the distribution strategies measured? Hmm, perhaps I need to structure each question to fit into these categories but phrased as open questions. Let me try to list 20 now, ensuring coverage and openness."
