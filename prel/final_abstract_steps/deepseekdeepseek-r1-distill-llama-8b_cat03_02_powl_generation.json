    "Text": "Once DA and ACI are done, the process moves into a looped configuration phase. The loop starts with BNC, which is followed by optional DR. So BNC must come first, then DR if needed. This is a loop, so Ill model this as a loop operator (LOOP) where the loop body is BNC followed by DR, and the condition is that if BNC completes, we check if DR is needed."
