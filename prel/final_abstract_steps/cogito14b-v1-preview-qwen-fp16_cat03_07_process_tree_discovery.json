Case ID 3 has multiple RMIs and a VF after. So the main flow seems to be a sequence of Receive Application (RA), Validate Form (VF), Assess Eligibility (AE), then there might be one or more loops involving RMI and VF, followed by Approval Decision (AD), Send Confirmation (SC), and Archive Case (AC)."

But since the log shows that after each RMI, there is another VF before proceeding, maybe inside the loop it's RMI -> (X(VF followed by continue or not?))."
