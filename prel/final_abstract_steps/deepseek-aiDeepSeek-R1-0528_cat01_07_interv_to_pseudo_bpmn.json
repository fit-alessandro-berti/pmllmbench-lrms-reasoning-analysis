If it has a PO, I log it into our accounting system. After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. If everything matches, I then send it to the department manager for approval. If theres a discrepancylike incorrect pricing or missing itemsI email the purchasing team to clarify. Sometimes, if the discrepancy cant be resolved easily, I have to escalate it to my supervisor. Once all issues are resolved and the manager approves, I schedule it for payment. Thats basically the flow."

    "Text": "Now, lets map the standard flow and variations: Standard Flow: 1. Receive Invoice by email Role: Accounts Payable Clerk 2.

Purchasing Confirmation Role: Purchasing Officer Compare invoice with PO. If discrepancy: a. Contact supplier or ask AP to hold wait for corrected invoice then back to step 3 b. Alternatively, escalate if needed But note: Dan says they contact supplier or ask AP to hold If correct: Send confirmation to AP. 4. Match Invoice Line Items Role: Accounts Payable Clerk This step is mentioned by Mary after Purchasing confirmation. But note: Dans step already includes comparing. However, Mary says she does the matching after Purchasing confirms receipt. Lets reconcile: Mary: After logging, forward to Purchasing for confirmation of receipt of goodsservices then she matches the invoice against PO. But Dan says he compares quantities, prices, etc. It seems there might be two checks: Purchasing confirms the goods were received and also checks the details Then Mary does a second check Alternatively, we can consider that the matching is done by Purchasing However, note Mary says: Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. So she does the matching after Purchasing confirms the receipt But Dan says he compares the details. This seems redundant Or perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing is about the receipt of goods, and then Mary does the matching"

    "Text": "Lets consolidate: It appears that the Purchasing Officer Dan is responsible for verifying that the goods were received and that the invoice matches the PO in terms of quantities, prices, etc. Then Mary AP Clerk does a system matching Maybe she is entering the data and the system does an automatic match However, Mary says: I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. We can model: After Purchasing confirms which includes their check, then Mary does a system match But note: Mary says if theres a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing. So she is the one who finds the discrepancy This suggests that the Purchasing step might not be catching discrepancies Given the confusion, well note: There is some ambiguity in the process. Some stakeholders indicate that Purchasing does the detailed check, while the AP Clerk then does a system matching which might be a formality or a system step. To simplify and avoid redundancy, we can combine: Well have one matching step: Step: Validate Invoice against PO Role: Purchasing Officer But then Mary says she does the matching Alternatively, we can interpret that the Purchasing Officer does the manual check and then the AP Clerk enters the data and the system does an automatic match Lets assume: After Purchasing confirms which includes manual check, the AP Clerk enters the invoice into the system and the system does an automatic match But Mary says: I match, meaning manually Well have to represent the two steps separately and note the ambiguity. Proposed flow: After Purchasing confirms which includes manual check, then the AP Clerk performs a system matching But note: Mary says if theres a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing. So she is the one who finds the discrepancy This seems redundant. Another idea: The Purchasing Officer does the manual check and then the AP Clerk does the same check in the system Well note the ambiguity and proceed. Standard flow: 1. Receive Invoice AP Clerk 2. Check for PO AP Clerk No PO: Send back to supplier End, or wait for resubmission With PO: Log into system and forward to Purchasing. 3. Validate Invoice Details Purchasing Officer: Check quantities, prices, etc. against PO and confirm receipt. If discrepancy: a. Contact supplier via Karen or directly wait for corrected invoice then back to step 3 b. Or ask AP to hold If correct: Send confirmation to AP. 4. System Matching AP Clerk: This step is done in the system. If matches: Proceed to manager approval. If discrepancy: Email Purchasing to clarify which might lead to contacting the supplier again But note: Step 3 already checked the details So step 4 should always match This is confusing. Lets assume that step 4 is a system step that might catch discrepancies that were missed Or it might be a formality Alternatively, we can remove step 4 as a separate task and consider that the system matching is part of step 2 logging or step 3 Given the confusion, well follow Marys description and have: After Purchasing confirms receipt step 3, then the AP Clerk does the matching step 4. And if there is a discrepancy at step 4, she emails Purchasing step 3 again. But Dan says he does the detailed check when he receives the invoice from AP. So well have: Step 3: Purchasing Officer confirms receipt and validates details But Mary only says confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Well stick to the literal from Mary for step 3: confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Then step 4: AP Clerk matches. Then, if at step 4 there is a discrepancy, the AP Clerk emails Purchasing Dan to clarify. Dan then might contact the supplier So: Step 4: Match Invoice against PO AP Clerk if discrepancy, go to step 3a: Resolve Discrepancy Purchasing Officer But step 3a is not the same as step 3 Well model: Step 3: Confirm Receipt Purchasing Officer if they havent received, then what But the process doesnt say. We assume they only confirm if received Step 4: Match Invoice AP Clerk if discrepancy, then go to a new step: Resolve Discrepancy which involves Purchasing Officer and possibly Supplier Relationship Manager."

Reject or ask to hold then what Carlos says: I might reject it or ask Mary to hold it and investigate further Then Mary might involve Purchasing or Rita We can model: Manager finds issue Reject End But then the invoice is not paid Or goes back to the beginning Or send back to AP Clerk for investigation which might lead to the discrepancy resolution path"

    "Text": "Given the complexity, well create a textual model that captures the main flow and the exceptions. Proposed BPMNlike textual model: Process: Invoice Approval Participants: Accounts Payable AP Clerk Mary Purchasing Officer Dan Department Manager Carlos AP Supervisor Rita Supplier Relationship Manager Karen indirectly Data Objects: Invoice Purchase Order PO Main Flow: 1. Start: Invoice Received by email Role: AP Clerk Task: Receive Invoice 2. Check for PO Number Role: AP Clerk Decision: If PO is present: Proceed to Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing. If PO is missing: a. Common path Send back to supplier requesting details End for this invoice until resubmitted. b. Exception path If the invoice is for informal services, escalate to AP Supervisor Rita for handling. 3. Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing Role: AP Clerk Task: Log invoice into accounting system and forward to Purchasing Officer. 4. Confirm Receipt of Goods and Validate Details Role: Purchasing Officer Task: Confirm that the goodsservices were received and validate invoice details quantities, prices against PO. Note: This step may involve contacting the supplier if needed But typically, they check internally. 5. Match Invoice against PO in System Role: AP Clerk Task: Perform matching in the accounting system. Decision: If matches: Proceed to Send to Manager for Approval. If discrepancy: Proceed to Resolve Discrepancy. 6. Send to Manager for Approval Role: AP Clerk Task: Send the invoice via system to the Department Manager. 7. Manager Approval Role: Department Manager Task: Review invoice, PO, and confirmation. Approve if correct. Decision: If approved: Proceed to Schedule Payment. If not approved due to issues: Proceed to Investigate Managers Concerns. 8. Schedule Payment Role: AP Clerk Task: Schedule the invoice for payment in the next payment run. End: Invoice paid. Exception Paths: Exception Path A: Handling Missing PO from step 2 When PO is missing and the invoice is for informal services: Task: AP Supervisor Rita works with department heads to decide: Option: Create retrospective PO then go to step 3 Log Invoice and Forward to Purchasing. Option: Reject invoice End. Exception Path B: Resolve Discrepancy from step 5 Step B1: AP Clerk emails Purchasing Officer to clarify. Step B2: Purchasing Officer attempts to resolve: Contact supplier directly or through Supplier Relationship Manager Karen to get corrected invoice or clarification. If resolved: Go back to step 5 Match Invoice against PO. If not resolved within a set time or after attempts: Escalate to AP Supervisor Rita. Step B3: AP Supervisor Rita intervenes: Contacts supplier, coordinates between departments, or decides to create a retrospective PO if applicable. If resolved: Go back to step 5. If not resolved: Reject invoice End. Exception Path C: Investigate Managers Concerns from step 7 Step C1: Department Manager rejects or asks to hold the invoice and investigate. Step C2: AP Clerk Mary investigates which may involve Purchasing Officer or AP Supervisor This might lead to the discrepancy resolution path Exception Path B or a new resolution. After investigation: If resolved: Go back to step 7 Manager Approval or step 6 Well go back to step 6 Send to Manager for Approval. If not resolved: Reject End. Additional Notes: The Supplier Relationship Manager Karen is involved in Exception Path B when Purchasing or AP Supervisor contacts her to resolve with the supplier. The AP Supervisor Rita handles complex exceptions and also the missing PO for informal services. Ambiguities: The exact nature of the Match Invoice against PO step step 5 is unclear because Purchasing already validated the details. It might be a system step that is automated, but Mary describes it as something she does. We have modeled it as a manualsystem task by the AP Clerk. The process for handling goods not received is not described. We assume that invoices are only sent after goods are received, so the Purchasing step step 4 only confirms receipt and validates details. This model captures the main flow and the key exceptions. It is structured so that a BPMN diagram can be drawn."
