    "Text": "Looking at Event 1 to 3: Temperature starts at 20C, pressure is 1 bar, vibration is 0 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position 0, energy 0.50 kWh. This seems like initial setup or standby. Temperature rises slightly by Event 3, but other readings are stable. Probably idle or preparatory phase."

    "Text": "Then Event 4: Temperature jumps to 50C, vibration increases to 30 Hz, material flow is 5 units/s. Thats a significant spike. High vibration and temperature suggest intense activity. This could be cutting or welding. But tool position is 5mm, which might be in a moving position."

    "Text": "Events 5-6: Temperature continues rising to 58C, vibration peaks at 38 Hz, material flow steady at 5. Tool position moves to 7 and 10. Energy consumption increases. This phase shows sustained high vibration and temperature, maybe a prolonged cutting operation."

    "Text": "Event 7-8: Temperature drops to 40C, vibration decreases to 10 Hz, material flow drops to 2. Tool position stays at 15. Energy consumption drops. This might be a transition phase, perhaps switching from cutting to another activity like assembly or quality check."

    "Text": "Events 9-12: Temperature spikes again to 80C, vibration jumps to 50 Hz, material flow stops at 0. Tool position remains at 15. High energy usage. This intense phase suggests welding, as welding machines often have high temperature and vibration."

    "Text": "Events 13-15: Temperature drops back to 20C, vibration stabilizes, material flow is 0. Energy consumption decreases. This looks like shutdown or idle mode, similar to the initial phase."

    "Text": "Now, grouping these phases: 1. Initial Setup (Events 1-3): Low readings, no activity. 2. Cutting/Grinding (Events 4-6): High temp, vibration, material flow. 3. Transition/Assembly (Events 7-8): Temperature drops, flow decreases. 4. Welding (Events 9-12): Peak temp, vibration, energy. 5. Shutdown (Events 13-15): Back to baseline."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "I need to label each phase. Cutting/Grinding and Welding are distinct. The transition phase might be assembly or quality check. But assembly usually involves steady material flow. Quality inspection might have lower readings. However, the data here doesnt include explicit inspection data. The tool position might indicate part handling, but without more context, its ambiguous. So the phases would be Setup, Cutting/Grinding, Transition, Welding, Shutdown. Assigning labels based on the observed patterns. Each rationale explains the sensor changes leading to the label."
