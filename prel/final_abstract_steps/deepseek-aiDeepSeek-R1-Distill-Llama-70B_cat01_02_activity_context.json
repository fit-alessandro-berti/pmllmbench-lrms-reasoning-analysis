So, the first Verify Documents could be Initial Document Verification, and the second one, after submission, could be Revised Document Verification or something similar.

So, similar renaming as in C001. Call Customer occurs twice here. The first is to clarify an account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up. So, perhaps Initial Customer Call and Follow-up Customer Call."

For each occurrence, the context differs based on the additional information provided. Now, Ill think about how to rename these activities. The names should clearly indicate the context, such as whether its initial, after submission, after adjustment, etc. Also, for Call Customer, indicating whether its initial, follow-up, or for a specific reason like missing documents or account discrepancies would be helpful."

C002: Verify Documents Initial Identity Verification, Verify Documents Post-Adjustment Verification, Call Customer Initial Customer Call, Call Customer Follow-up Customer Call.
