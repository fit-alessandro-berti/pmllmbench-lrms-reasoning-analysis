    "Text": "I can then provide rationale for each grouping For Cutting Metal The sensor readings show a gradual increase in temperature vibration and tool movement along with consistent material feed 5 unitss which indicate an operation where metal is being cut by a cutting tool The energy consumption increases from 200 kWh to 300 kWh during this phase For Assembling Parts After cutting the sensor readings show a decrease in temperature and vibration compared to cutting but pressure increases to 2 bar which might be associated with clamping or aligning parts together tool position is held constant at 15 mm indicating assembly precision work Material flow reduces from 5 unitss to 2 unitss suggesting that material feeding is less intense during assembly For Welding A sudden increase in temperature 80C and vibration 50 Hz with a high spike in energy consumption 500 kWh indicates the application of significant heat likely from an arc welding process The fact that theres no additional material flow 0 unitss suggests that the process is focused on fusing parts together rather than cutting or assembling For Packaging After welding the sensors show a cooldown with reduced temperature and vibration levels returning near idle conditions but then there is a slight repositioning of the tool from 15 mm to 20 mm along with minimal material flow 1 unitss and low energy consumption which suggests that the finished product is being transferred or moved into a packaging station for final handling"
