Rules: Credit check before risk assessment (9:30 vs 10:00). Risk assessment before loan decision (10:00 vs 11:00). Inform applicant after loan decision (13:00 is after 11:00). If approved then finalize documentation before closing. Finalize Documentation occurs at 13:30 and Close Case at 14:00. So case1 satisfies strict rules."

Must do Credit Check before Risk Assessment but here risk assessment happened at 08:20 and credit check occurred later at 09:00. So that is a violation of normative order. 3. Also, Finalize Documentation should not be done if loan decision is rejected, yet there is finalization documentation performed (at 10:00) after the rejection decision (09:30). So, violations for Case2: Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check. Finalize Documentation was executed after rejection. Thus violation of normative rules for case2 in two aspects."

Yes, it does (09:00 then close case 10:00). Also check ordering of events: Application Received, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. So all normative rules are followed. So case3 doesnt violate the strict sequence norms."

Case3: None. Desiderata Violations: For case1... missing Follow up Call... For case2... missing Follow up Call is also a recommended practice. For case3: ...Credit Check occurred more than 24 hours after application received (36 hours later)... Inform Applicant happened later than recommended 48 hours from loan decision (51 hours difference)... Follow up Call event is missing."

It might be due to oversight or system error, and finalizing documentation despite rejection suggests that process automation failed to branch properly. For case3: The delays in performing Credit Check and Inform Applicant could indicate resource constraints or procedural backlog; however, it is not strictly non compliant but suboptimal performance relative to recommended timelines."
