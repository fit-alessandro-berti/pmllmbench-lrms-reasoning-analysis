The parallel block includes Create Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice, and Pay Invoice. Thats a problem because those steps shouldnt all be parallel."

For example, you cant receive goods before creating the purchase order. Also, you cant receive the invoice before creating the PO. The matching step (6) should come after both receiving the invoice and the PO exists. Paying the invoice (7) should only happen after matching (6)."

But the matching step (6) cant happen until both the invoice and the PO are there. The invoice is tied to the PO.
