The 'E' has a responded existence on 'A', which actually requires that every instance of E must be preceded by an A. Wait no, responded existence is when an activity must be preceded by another... Wait, maybe I need to double-check. Let me recall: in DECLARE, a responded existence from X to Y means every occurrence of X must have a Y after it."

That's true because every claim that is closed (C) must have been received (R) before. But maybe the intended process has more steps between R and C, but the precedence here is just a subset. So this rule isn't contradictory, just a generic one."

Let's see. Maybe the noncoexistence between E and C causes a problem. Since in the proper process, E must come before C, but they can't exist in the same trace?"
