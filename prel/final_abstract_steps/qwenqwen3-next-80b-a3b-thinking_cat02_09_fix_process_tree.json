    "Text": "Wait, but receiving goods and receiving invoice are separate steps. Typically, you receive the goods first (from the supplier), then when the supplier sends the invoice, you receive it. Then you match the invoice to the PO and the goods received. But maybe sometimes the invoice comes before goods? Hmm, but usually, you receive goods first, then the invoice. But maybe in some cases the invoice comes first? Not sure. But generally, the PO is created first. Then goods are received (based on the PO), then the invoice is received, then matched. So the sequence should be: Create PO, then Receive Goods, then Receive Invoice, then Match, then Pay. But the problem is that the current model allows all those steps to happen in any order. So for example, Pay_Invoice could happen before Match_Invoice, which is impossible because you need to match first. Or Receive_Goods could happen before Create_PO, which doesn't make sense because you need a PO to receive goods against. So the correct sequence should be: After Approve_Requisition, you must create the PO. Then, you receive goods (but you can't receive goods before PO is created). Then receive invoice (but the invoice can't be received before goods are received? Not necessarily. Sometimes the invoice might come before goods, but usually, the supplier sends the invoice after shipping, which is after goods are received. But maybe there's a scenario where invoice comes first. However, in standard Procure-to-Pay, typically the goods are received first, then invoice. But perhaps the exact order of Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice might vary? Hmm. Wait, in some cases, the supplier sends the invoice along with the goods, but you still have to receive the goods first. Or maybe you receive the invoice after receiving the goods. But maybe the invoice could arrive before the goods? Like if the supplier sends the invoice early. But in reality, the matching process requires both the PO, the goods receipt, and the invoice. So the match step can't happen until both goods and invoice are received. But maybe the order of receiving goods and invoice can vary? Like, you could receive the invoice before the goods, but then you can't match until both are present. So the Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice could be in any order relative to each other, but both must happen before Match_Invoice."

    "Text": "Wait, but how to model that. Let's break it down. So steps after approval: - Create_PO must come first. Because you can't receive goods without a PO. So Receive_Goods can't happen before Create_PO. Similarly, you can't match invoice to PO unless PO exists. So the correct structure after approval would be: First, Create_PO. Then, the next steps: Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice can occur in any order (so they can be in parallel), but both must happen before Match_Invoice.

So the sequence after approve_req is a sequence of create_po, then the parallel block (which contains receive_goods and receive_invoice), then match_invoice, pay_invoice, close_case. Yes. Let me check if there are any other possible issues. For example, could someone pay before matching? In the corrected model, pay_invoice comes after match_invoice, so no. So that's fixed. Another thing: could the close_case happen before paying? No, because close_case is after pay_invoice. Yes. So this structure should enforce the correct order."
