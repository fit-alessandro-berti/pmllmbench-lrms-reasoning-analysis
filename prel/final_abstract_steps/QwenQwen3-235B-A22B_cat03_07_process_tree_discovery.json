Case 3 has RA, VF, AE, two RMIs, then VF again, AD, SC, AC. So sometimes they have to request missing info once, sometimes twice, then validate again."

But case 3 has two RMI steps followed by VF once. This suggests that the model allows multiple RMI steps followed by VF. So perhaps the loop allows RMI multiple times, then VF once, then loop back. But this model would not capture that."
