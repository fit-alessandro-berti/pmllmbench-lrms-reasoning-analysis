The XOR gateways could cause delays if decisions take time. Also, the parallel tasks (C1 and C2) might be okay, but maybe they can be automated more? The approval step might be a bottleneck if its manual. Also, handling Custom requests might take longer because of the feasibility analysis and possible back-and-forth."

That way, even before the initial check, the system could flag it as potential Custom, allowing proactive handling."

Maybe instead of looping, the system could automatically trigger a re-evaluation with more info or adjust parameters to meet approval criteria, reducing back-and-forth."

Alternatively, if one fails, maybe reroute? Not sure yet."

    "Text": "Potential changes to each task: 1. Task A (Receive Customer Request): Automate parsing the request type using NLP. Maybe extract key data points (order details, customer history) to determine if its Standard or Custom upfront. This reduces the Gateway decision time. 2. Gateway (XOR) Check Request Type: Since the type is determined automatically, this becomes a system decision without human input, speeding up the split into B1 or B2. 3. Task B1 (Standard Validation): Automate using APIs. Maybe integrate with existing systems to validate without manual steps. The parallel checks (C1 and C2) could be done in parallel via automated scripts, reducing their duration. 4. Task B2 (Custom Feasibility): Instead of manual analysis, use a predictive model trained on past Custom requests. The model could take request details and customer history to predict feasibility. If feasible, proceed; else reject. This reduces time here. 5. Gateway (XOR) Is Customization Feasible?: Automated via the models prediction, so no manual decision needed. 6. Task E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation): Could be automated with templates and data integration. Once feasible, generate the quote automatically. 7. Task E2 (Rejection): Automated email/notice sent immediately. 8. After paths (Standard/Custom completed), Gateway (XOR) Approval Needed?: Use predefined rules (e.g., order value > X, requires approval). The decision here is automated, so faster. 9. Task F (Obtain Manager Approval): If approval is needed, use an automated system where managers get notifications and can approve via a mobile app or dashboard. Set up SLA-based approvals (e.g., within 2 hours) with escalations if not responded. 10. If approval denied (Task H), instead of looping back, maybe trigger a corrective action: For example, analyze why approval was denied (e.g., budget overrun) and automatically adjust the request parameters (like reducing price, extending delivery) and resubmit for approval. This would avoid the loop and the customer having to go through the process again. 11. Task G (Generate Invoice): Fully automated via integration with finance systems once approval is granted or not required. 12. Task I (Send Confirmation): Automated email/SMS, triggered right after invoice generation."

Maybe the denial is because the feasibility wasnt there, so perhaps it should go back to the feasibility analysis? Hmm, maybe the original process has a flaw here. If approval is denied after the Custom path, perhaps the system needs to re-evaluate the feasibility again, but that could be redundant. Alternatively, maybe the approval is for something else, like budget, so the loop back might need to adjust the quotation. This part might need rethinking in the redesign."
