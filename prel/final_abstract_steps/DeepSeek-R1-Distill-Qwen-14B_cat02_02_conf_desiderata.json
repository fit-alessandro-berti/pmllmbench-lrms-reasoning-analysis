They might have done it quickly, but the main issue is the sequence. So desiderata-wise, maybe checking if any timing recommendations were violated. It seems they did the Credit Check relatively quickly after the application (8:00 to 9:00), but since the order was wrong, I think the desiderata here is about the promptness, but the main issue is the normative. Maybe they didnt violate desiderata timing, but the main issue is the normative."

But actually, the Credit Check was done the same day, so maybe within the 24 hours. So perhaps the timing is still okay, but the order is not.
