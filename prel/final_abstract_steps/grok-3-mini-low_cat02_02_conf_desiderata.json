For desiderata: - Credit Check: 09:30 is within 24 hours of 09:00 (same day). - Inform Applicant: Within 48 hours of Loan Decision at 11:00? Informed at 13:00, which is 2 hours later â€“ well within. - Follow-up Call: Not mentioned, so probably not done, but its just recommended."

Not allowed) - 10:30: Close Case Violations: - Risk Assessment before Credit Check: Skips the order. - Finalize Documentation after rejection: Explicitly not allowed. So, normative violations in Case 2. Desiderata: Not relevant since there are normative violations, but lets check: - Credit Check at 09:00 is within 24 hours of 08:00. - Inform Applicant: Wait, its not in the log! The sequence requires Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, but its missing! - The normative rules say: Loan Decision Inform Applicant - In Case 2, after Loan Decision at 09:30, next is Finalize Documentation at 10:00, then Close Case. - Is Inform Applicant skipped? The log doesnt have it. That might be another violation! - Checking the log: For Case 2, activities: Application Received, Risk Assessment, Credit Check, Loan Decision, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. No Inform Applicant. - So, thats a skip in the sequence: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. Additional normative violation: Skipping Inform Applicant. Follow-up Call: Not mentioned."

Normative Violations: - Case 2: - Risk Assessment before Credit Check. - Finalize Documentation after rejection. - Possibly skipping Inform Applicant (if its required and not done). 2. Desiderata Failures: - Case 1: Possibly no Follow-up Call. - Case 3: Credit Check >24 hours, Inform Applicant >48 hours, No Follow-up Call. 3. Suggestions/Justifications: - For Case 2: The out-of-order activities might be due to human error or system glitch. Finalizing documentation after rejection could be a mistake in process execution. - For Case 3: Delays might be due to weekends, holidays, or high workload, which are understandable but should be minimized."
