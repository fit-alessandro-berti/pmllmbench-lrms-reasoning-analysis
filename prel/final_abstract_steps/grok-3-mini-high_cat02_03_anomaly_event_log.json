Approve Purchase Requisition 3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) 4. Receive Goods 5. Vendor Invoice Received 6. Match Invoice to PO (this often includes checking against goods received) 7. Release Payment 8. Close Case"

    "Text": "The sequence can vary slightly, but generally, activities should follow a logical order where prerequisites are met. For example, you cant issue a PO without approving the PR, and you shouldnt receive goods before issuing a PO, as that might indicate unauthorized receipt. Also, payment should not be released before the invoice is matched and goods are received to avoid fraud or errors."

    "Text": "Case 1002: - Create PR -> Issue PO -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Release Payment -> Approve PR -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO -> Close Case Here, the Approve PR activity happens after Issue PO and even after Release Payment. Thats problematic because typically, the PR must be approved before issuing a PO. Also, payment is released before the PR is approved and before goods are received, which is risky. Goods are received after payment, which might indicate that payment was made without confirmation of receipt, potentially leading to non-delivery or fraud. Anomalies: - Issue PO before Approve PR - Release Payment before Approve PR, before Receive Goods, and before Match Invoice to PO - Approve PR after Release Payment - Receive Goods after Release Payment This could be very problematic as it bypasses controls, increasing the risk of unauthorized purchases, payments without goods, etc."

Also, Match Invoice to PO occurs after Receive Goods, but payment is released too early. Anomalies: - Release Payment before Vendor Invoice Received - Release Payment before Receive Goods This is problematic because payment should only be released after invoice matching and goods receipt to ensure that whats being paid for was actually delivered and invoiced correctly. Early payment could result in overpayment or payment for undelivered goods."

    "Text": "Case 1004: - Create PR -> Approve PR -> Receive Goods -> Issue PO -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Match Invoice to PO -> Release Payment -> Close Case Receive Goods happens before Issue PO. Thats unusual because typically, a PO is issued first to authorize the purchase, and then goods are received against that PO. Receiving goods without a PO could mean unauthorized receipts or errors in inventory. Also, the sequence has Receive Goods early on. Anomalies: - Receive Goods before Issue PO This could be problematic as it might lead to receiving goods that werent ordered properly, potential stock discrepancies, or fraud where goods are received without proper authorization."

Case 1001 is normal."
