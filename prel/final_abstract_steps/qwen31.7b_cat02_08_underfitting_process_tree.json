The root is a sequence with children [receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order].

Wait, but in the successful_subtree, the children are authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order. Then the close_order is part of the root's children. So, the close_order is after the XOR node. So, the process would be: after the XOR node, you do close_order. So, the close_order is part of the root's children, but in the successful_subtree, the close_order is in the children? Or is the close_order part of the root's children? Wait, the root is a sequence with children [receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order].
