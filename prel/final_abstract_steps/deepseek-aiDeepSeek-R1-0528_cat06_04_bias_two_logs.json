First, note the attributes: LocalResident: Group A has FALSE (non-local), Group B has TRUE (local) for all cases. CommunityGroup: Group A has None for all cases. Group B has either Highland Civic Darts Club or None. PreliminaryScore: The initial score before any adjustment. ScoreAdjustment: An adjustment applied to the preliminary score. In Group A, it is always 0 (or N/A in ManualReview). In Group B, we see adjustments: specifically, a +10 (Community Boost) for cases that are part of the Highland Civic Darts Club. Decision: The final outcome (Approved/Rejected)."

No adjustments to the preliminary score (ScoreAdjustment = 0) except during ManualReview where it is N/A (meaning no adjustment?). Cases: P001: PreliminaryScore 720 -> Approved P002: PreliminaryScore 710 -> Rejected P003: PreliminaryScore 740 -> Approved 2. Group B (Unprotected Group): All cases are local residents (LocalResident = TRUE). CommunityGroup: U001: Highland Civic Darts Club -> received a +10 boost. U002: None -> no boost. U003: Highland Civic Darts Club -> received a +10 boost. Decisions: U001: PreliminaryScore 720 -> adjusted to 730 -> Approved. U002: PreliminaryScore 710 -> no adjustment -> Rejected.

So the threshold is at least above 710. In Group B: U002: 710 (no adjustment) -> Rejected (same as P002 in Group A). U001: 720 adjusted to 730 -> Approved. Without the boost, it would have been 720. In Group A, 720 was approved (P001) so even without boost it would have been approved. Therefore, the boost did not change the outcome for U001. U003: 695 adjusted to 705 -> Approved. Without the boost, the score would have been 695. In Group A, we do not have a case with 695. But note that in Group A, 710 was rejected. Therefore, 695 (which is below 710) would have been rejected in Group A. However, because of the boost, U003 reached 705 and was approved."

    "Text": "Moreover, note that the community boost is only applied to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club. Since Group A (Protected Group) has no community group members, they never receive this boost. Group B (Unprotected Group) has two cases that are members and received the boost. This leads to a systematic difference: In Group B, applicants who are members of the Highland Civic Darts Club get a +10 boost, which can push their score above the approval threshold (as in U003). In Group A, no such boost is available, so applicants with the same preliminary score (e.g., 695) would be rejected."

    "Text": "Therefore, the bias manifests in the form of a community boost that is only available to the Unprotected Group (Group B) and not to the Protected Group (Group A). This results in a systematic advantage for certain members of Group B (those in the community group) by increasing their scores, which can change the decision from rejection to approval. Additionally, note that the LocalResident attribute: Group A is non-local and Group B is local. The community boost is tied to being a member of a local community group (since the community group is only present in Group B). However, the problem states that Group A is the Protected Group and Group B is Unprotected. The bias here is that the community boost is only applied to the Unprotected Group (local residents) and not to the Protected Group (non-local residents). Moreover, the community boost is applied arbitrarily: only to a specific community group (Highland Civic Darts Club). This might be a form of favoritism towards a particular group, which is not available to others. Since the Protected Group (non-locals) are excluded from joining such community groups (as per the data, they are all None), they are systematically disadvantaged."

    "Text": "Conclusion: The log for Group B (Unprotected Group) exhibits bias because: 1. A community boost of +10 is applied to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club, which is only available to local residents (Group B). 2. This boost leads to a different outcome for at least one case (U003) that would have been rejected without the boost (as per the pattern in Group A, where 710 was rejected and 720 approved, so 695 would be rejected). 3. The Protected Group (Group A) does not have access to this community boost, so they are held to the original scoring system without any such adjustments. This bias manifests as a systematic advantage for local residents who are part of a specific community group, leading to higher approval rates for that subgroup compared to non-locals who cannot access the same benefit."
