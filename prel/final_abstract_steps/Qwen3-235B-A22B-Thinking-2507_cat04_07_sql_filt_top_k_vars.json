    "Text": "Another thing: timestamps might have duplicates? The problem says sorting events within that case by their timestamp. If two events in the same case have the same timestamp, the order might be undefined. But the problem doesn't specify how to handle that. We'll assume that timestamps are unique per case, or that the order in case of ties doesn't matter for the variant definition. So the query uses ORDER BY timestamp in the STRING_AGG, which will order them, and if there are ties, the order might be arbitrary, but that's acceptable per the problem statement."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now, let's check if the query correctly returns all events from the top K variant cases. Yes, because we join event_log with case_variants on case_id, then filter where variant is in top_variant_list. Alternatively, using a WHERE clause with a subquery: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM case_variants WHERE variant IN ( SELECT variant FROM case_variants GROUP BY variant ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC LIMIT K ) ); This is another way to write it, perhaps more concise. But the CTE approach is clearer."
