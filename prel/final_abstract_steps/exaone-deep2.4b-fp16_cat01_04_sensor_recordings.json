    "Text": "The first three events (1-3) show low temperature (20-21°C), pressure (1 bar), and vibration (0 Hz), with no material flow or tool movement. This strongly suggests an initial inactive setup phase."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 4-6 exhibit increasing temperature (50-58°C), higher vibration (30-38 Hz), consistent material flow (5 units/s), and tool movement (5-10 mm). These patterns are indicative of a cutting process where material is being processed at high speed and moderate energy levels."

    "Text": "Event 9 shows extremely high temperature (80°C), high vibration (50 Hz), no material flow, and high energy consumption (5 kWh). These observations align closely with the characteristics of a welding operation, where heat and vibration are maximized for fusing metal."

    "Text": "Event 10, following peak welding activity in Event 9, has temperature falling back to 40°C, with lower vibration (10 Hz) and slight material flow (2 units/s). This suggests a cooling or wrap-up phase as welding concludes."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 11-12 have lower temperature (25°C), steady material flow (1 unit/s), and slight tool position change (20 mm). These patterns suggest assembly activity, where pre-welded parts are being joined using moderate energy levels."

    "Text": "Events 7-8 exhibit moderate temperature (40°C), vibration (10 Hz), tool position (15 mm), and material flow (2 units/s). This appears to be a transitional phase, possibly cooling after cutting or setting up for welding."

    "Text": "Events 1-3 and 13-15, which exhibit minimal sensor activity and tool rest positions (0 mm tool position and low energy), were collectively identified as setup/reset phases and excluded from labeling as they do not match the listed manufacturing activities."
