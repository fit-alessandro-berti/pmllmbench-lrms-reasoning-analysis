Process: Hire-to-Retire (Post Job -> Screen -> Interview -> Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll -> Close). 2. Analyze the Standard Hire-to-Retire Process: Standard Flow: Post Job Ad -> Screen Candidates -> Conduct Interviews -> Make Hiring Decision -> (If hired) Onboard Employee -> Add to Payroll -> Close Case. Logic: Screening usually happens before interviewing. The decision happens after gathering information (screening + interviews)."

Parallelism of Decide and Interview: From Screen, there are edges to both Decide and Interview. In a Strict Partial Order, if there is no edge between Decide and Interview, they can happen in any order or concurrently. 2. Logic Flaw: Make_Hiring_Decision is enabled immediately after Screen_Candidates. This allows the hiring decision to be made before Conduct_Interviews. You cant onboard someone before interviewing them. 3. Lack of Choice: There is no explicit XOR operator. The model assumes a happy path where everyone is hired. Summary of Model 1 Anomalies: Ordering Violation: Make_Hiring_Decision can precede or occur concurrently with Conduct_Interviews. Hard-Coded Success: The flow Decide -> Onboard -> Payroll implies every candidate is hired."

Analyze Model 2: Graph Structure: Post -> Screen Post -> Interview Interview -> Decide Decide -> loop_onboarding loop_onboarding -> xor_payroll xor_payroll -> Close Anomalies/Deviations: 1. Ordering Violation (Screening vs Interviewing): Post connects to both Screen and Interview. This implies they are concurrent or Interview can happen without Screen. 2. Ordering Violation (Screening vs Decision): Interview leads to Decide. Screen is not connected to Decide. 3. The Loop on Onboarding: *(Onboard, skip). This allows repeating Onboard_Employee. 4. The XOR on Payroll: X(Payroll, skip). This allows skipping payroll entirely. If you onboard an employee, adding them to payroll is usually mandatory."
