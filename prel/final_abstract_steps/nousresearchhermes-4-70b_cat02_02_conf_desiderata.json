Part 2: Desiderata (Recommended but Not Strict) - Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours of Application Received. - Inform Applicant should be within 48 hours of Loan Decision. - Follow-up Call is encouraged but not required."

Problem: Risk Assessment without a prior Credit Check (violates rule: Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment) ... Problem: For rejection, we should not finalize documentation. (violates rule: if rejected, do not finalize documentation). Case 3: ... No violation of normative rules."

But note: the normative rule requires that after the loan decision (whether approved or rejected) we must inform the applicant. The log for Case 2 does not have an 'Inform Applicant' event at all! This is a serious normative violation because the rule says: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. ... So Case 2 is missing the 'Inform Applicant' step entirely. Therefore, we have an additional normative violation: skipping the 'Inform Applicant' activity."

    "Text": "3. Interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors: Case 1: The only issue is the missing Follow-up Call, which might be due to oversight or prioritization of other tasks. Case 2: The normative violations are serious and indicate a breakdown in the process. The out-of-order processing... might be due to a misunderstanding of the process... The missing 'Inform Applicant' step is a critical failure... might be an oversight or a system error. Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan is also a mistake, which might be due to a system error or human error. Case 3: The desiderata violations (delays in Credit Check and Informing, and no Follow-up Call) might be due to workload constraints, staff shortages, or system delays."
