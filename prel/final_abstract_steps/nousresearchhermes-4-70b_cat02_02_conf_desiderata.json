    "Text": "**Step 2: Identify desiderata violations** Desiderata: - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received. - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision. - Follow-up Call is encouraged (but not required) and should be before closing. **Case 1:** - Credit Check: 2024-01-10 09:00 (Application Received) to 09:30 (same day) -> within 1.5 hours (within 24 hours, so OK). - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-10 11:00 (Loan Decision) to 13:00 (same day) -> 2 hours (within 48 hours, so OK). - Follow-up Call: Not present in the log for Case 1 -> This is a desideratum violation (should have been done, but its not required). However, note that the log for Case 1 does not show a Follow-up Call. The desideratum says its encouraged, so skipping it is a violation of the recommended practice. **Case 2:** - Credit Check: 2024-01-11 08:00 (Application Received) to 09:00 (same day) -> 1 hour (within 24 hours, so OK). - Inform Applicant: Not applicable because the loan was rejected and then they closed the case without informing? Actually, the log shows Inform Applicant is not present for Case 2. But note: the normative rule requires that after the loan decision (whether approved or rejected) we must inform the applicant. The log for Case 2 does not have an Inform Applicant event at all! This is a serious normative violation because the rule says: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. However, the event log for Case 2 does have an Inform Applicant event? Let me check: Looking at the event log for Case 2: | Case ID | Timestamp           | Activity              | |---------|---------------------|-----------------------| | 2       | 2024-01-11 08:00    | Application Received  | | 2       | 2024-01-11 08:20    | Risk Assessment       | | 2       | 2024-01-11 09:00    | Credit Check          | | 2       | 2024-01-11 09:30    | Loan Decision (Rejected) | | 2       | 2024-01-11 10:00    | Finalize Documentation| | 2       | 2024-01-11 10:30    | Close Case            | There is no Inform Applicant event. This is a normative violation (which I initially missed). But note: the problem says that the normative rules require that after the loan decision, the applicant must be informed. So the absence of Inform Applicant is a normative violation. However, the problem statement in the event log for Case 2 does not list an Inform Applicant event. So we must consider that. Therefore, Case 2 has three normative violations: 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (order violation). 2. Missing Inform Applicant after loan decision (skipping). 3. Finalize Documentation after rejection (contradictory action). But note: the problem statement in the event log for Case 2 does not show Inform Applicant, but the problem says in the description of Case 2: *(No prior Credit Check - violates normative)* and then later we see a Credit Check after Risk Assessment. And then we see Finalize Documentation and Close Case. There is no Inform Applicant event. So that is a normative violation (skipping an activity). **Case 3:** - Credit Check: 2024-01-12 09:00 to 2024-01-14 10:00 -> 2 days (which is 48 hours) and 1 hour -> exceeds 24 hours (desiderata violation). - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-14 12:00 (Loan Decision) to 2024-01-16 15:00 -> 2 days and 3 hours (exceeds 48 hours, desiderata violation). - Follow-up Call: Not present (desiderata violation). So for Case 3, we have: - Credit Check too late (desideratum). - Inform Applicant too late (desideratum). - No Follow-up Call (desideratum). But note: the normative rules are still satisfied. **Conclusion for normative violations after rechecking Case 2:** We found an additional normative violation in Case 2: skipping the Inform Applicant activity. Now, lets re-state the normative violations: **Case 1:** - No normative violations. **Case 2:** 1. **Order violation:** Risk Assessment occurred before Credit Check (should be Credit Check first). 2. **Skipping required activity:** Inform Applicant is missing after the loan decision. 3. **Contradictory action:** Finalize Documentation was performed after a rejection. **Case 3:** - No normative violations."

    "Text": "**Step 3: Desiderata violations** **Case 1:** - Desiderata: - Follow-up Call: Not present -> violation of desideratum (but not required, so its just a recommendation not followed) **Case 2:** - Desiderata: - The normative violations are more severe, but we can still check desiderata for the events that did occur: - Credit Check: within 24 hours (OK). - Inform Applicant: This event is missing, but even if it were present, we dont have the time to check (since its missing). However, the desideratum for Inform Applicant within 48 hours of loan decision: since the loan decision was at 09:30 and the case was closed at 10:30 without informing, we can say that the informing was not done at all, which is a normative violation. The timing desideratum doesnt apply because the normative rule was broken by skipping the step. - Follow-up Call: Not present -> desideratum violation. But note: the desiderata are not broken if the normative rule is broken (because the process is not following the normative steps). However, we can still report the desiderata that are not met independently. But in Case 2, the missing Inform Applicant is a normative violation, so we dont need to report the desideratum for timing of informing because the step was skipped. However, we can note that the desideratum for the Follow-up Call was also violated. **Case 3:** - Desiderata violations: 1. Credit Check: Took 2 days (exceeding 24 hours recommendation). 2. Inform Applicant: Took 2 days and 3 hours (exceeding 48 hours recommendation). 3. No Follow-up Call."

Normative violations:** - **Case 2** has three normative violations: 1. **Risk Assessment was performed before Credit Check** (should be Credit Check first). 2. **The activity Inform Applicant is missing** after the loan decision (a required step was skipped). 3. **Finalize Documentation was performed after a loan rejection** (should not be done for rejected loans). - Case 1 and Case 3 have no normative violations. **2. Desiderata violations:** - **Case 1**: - **No Follow-up Call** was performed (a recommended best practice was skipped).  - **Case 2**: - **No Follow-up Call** was performed (desideratum violation). - (Note: The step Inform Applicant was entirely skipped, which is a normative violation, so we dont consider the timing of that step under desiderata.)  - **Case 3**: - **Credit Check was performed 48 hours and 1 hour after the application was received** (exceeds the recommended 24-hour window). - **Inform Applicant was performed 2 days and 3 hours after the loan decision** (exceeds the recommended 48-hour window). - **No Follow-up Call** was performed. **3. Interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors:** - **Case 1**: The process was followed correctly regarding normative rules. The only issue is the missing Follow-up Call, which might be due to oversight or prioritization of other tasks. However, it is not a critical issue. - **Case 2**:  - The normative violations are serious and indicate a breakdown in the process.  - The out-of-order processing (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might be due to a misunderstanding of the process or an attempt to expedite the process by starting the risk assessment without waiting for the credit check. However, this is incorrect and violates the rules.  - The missing Inform Applicant step is a critical failure. The applicant was not informed of the decision, which is a required step. This might be an oversight or a system error.  - Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan is also a mistake, which might be due to a system error or human error (e.g., the document preparation was triggered by the loan decision being made, without checking the decision outcome).  - The desideratum violation (no Follow-up Call) is minor compared to the normative issues. - **Case 3**:  - The desiderata violations (delays in Credit Check and Informing, and no Follow-up Call) might be due to workload constraints, staff shortages, or system delays. The process still followed the required sequence, but timing and the optional Follow-up Call were not met. The lack of Follow-up Call might be because the team prioritized other tasks.  - **General note on Case 2**: The multiple errors in Case 2 suggest a need for retraining or a process review for that case handler or the system that supports the process. **Summary Table:** | Case ID | Normative Violations? | Desiderata Violations? | |---------|-----------------------|------------------------| | 1       | None                  | - No Follow-up Call (desideratum)| | 2       | Yes (3 violations)    | - No Follow-up Call (desideratum) | | 3       | None                  | - Credit Check delay (desideratum) <br> - Inform Applicant delay (desideratum) <br> - No Follow-up Call (desideratum) | We have detailed the reasons above."
