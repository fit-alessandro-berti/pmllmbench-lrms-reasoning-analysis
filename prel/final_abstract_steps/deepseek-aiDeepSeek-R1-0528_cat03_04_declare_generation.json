Binary constraints: - Precedence: TFC must be preceded by DD: precedence(DD, TFC) CE must be preceded by DD: precedence(DD, CE) PC must be preceded by TFC and CE: but note, precedence is binary.

But note: PC also requires CE? However, response only says that if TFC occurs then PC must occur after, but it doesn't require CE to occur? So we might need more constraints. - Coexistence: TFC and CE must both occur? But we already have existence? Actually, coexistence means if one occurs the other must occur (in any order). We don't necessarily need it because we have precedence constraints that require both? - Succession: succession(DD, TFC): TFC must occur and it must occur after DD, and also DD must occur before TFC?

But to be safe, we can add existence for each activity? Alternatively, we can skip existence and rely on the succession constraints? But note: the succession constraints only enforce the existence of the activities that are in the chain? For example, the chain from IG to FL enforces all activities? Specifically, the chain: IG -> DD -> TFC -> PC -> ... -> FL and DD -> CE -> PC This enforces that TFC, CE, PC, ... all occur? So we can skip the existence constraints? However, the problem says: \"each product idea goes through a series of steps\", so we can assume existence? However, to be complete, we'll add existence for each activity?
