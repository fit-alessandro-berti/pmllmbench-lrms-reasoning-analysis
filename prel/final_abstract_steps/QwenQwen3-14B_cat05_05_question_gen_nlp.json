    "Text": "Okay, the user wants me to generate 20 open-ended questions about the described supply chain process for a smartphone manufacturer. Let me start by understanding the process thoroughly. The process involves RD, sourcing components from various international suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, distribution to regional centers, and then to retailers and consumers. There are elements like just-in-time for high-demand areas, aggregated shipments for others, quality checks, logistics coordination, compliance, and use of digital systems with analytics."

    "Text": "First, I need to think about different aspects of the supply chain. Maybe start with the RD phase. How does the design phase affect sourcing? Then, supplier relationships—what if a supplier in Taiwan faces a disruption? How does the company manage that? Lead times and quality metrics—how do they balance speed with quality?"

    "Text": "Transportation is another area. Air vs. sea freight, customs, insurance. What are the risks there? Inventory strategies—just-in-time vs. aggregated. How do they decide which markets get which? What if there's a forecast error? Quality assurance protocols—how strict are they, and how do they handle recalls?"

    "Text": "Environmental and labor regulations—how do they ensure compliance across different regions? Carbon footprint reduction—what strategies are they using? Digital systems—how do they integrate purchase orders and analytics? Data analytics—what kind of insights do they get, and how are they used?"

    "Text": "Also, consider the impact of geopolitical issues, currency fluctuations, time zones. Maybe questions about supplier diversification, risk management, technology integration, customer expectations, and continuous improvement. Wait, I need to avoid SQL queries and focus on open-ended questions. Let me list possible angles: supplier risks, inventory management, logistics challenges, quality control, compliance, technology use, forecasting accuracy, customer satisfaction, cost control, sustainability, etc. Each angle can generate a couple of questions. Let me check if I have 20. Maybe some overlap, but need to ensure they are distinct and thought-provoking. Let me start drafting them one by one, making sure each question is open-ended and not too technical."
