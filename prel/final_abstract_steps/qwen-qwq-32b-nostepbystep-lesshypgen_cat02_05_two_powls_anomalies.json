But thats a problem because in the standard process, interviews usually come after screening, but the decision is made after interviews, right? Wait no, maybe the decision is based on interviews. Wait, the standard process would be: screen candidates (narrow down), then conduct interviews (maybe multiple), then decide. So in Model1, after screening, both Decide and Interview are possible. That suggests that the decision could be made before the interviews, which is an anomaly. Thats a key point. Because the decision should come after interviews. So in model1, the edge from Screen to Interview and Screen to Decide implies that after screening, the process can either decide (possibly rejecting without interview?) or go to interview, but the decision can happen before the interview. Thats a problem."

Or is there a missing edge between Interview and Decide? Let me check the model1 code again. The model1 edges are: model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide) model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview) model1.order.add_edge(Decide, Onboard) Wait, so after screening, theres an edge to Decide and to Interview.
