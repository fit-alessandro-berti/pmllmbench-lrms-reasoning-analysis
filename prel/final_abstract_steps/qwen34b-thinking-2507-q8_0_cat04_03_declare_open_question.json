It's not just a list of steps but has specific constraints like exactly one for preliminary credit check, noncoexistence for fund transfers and application receipt, and various precedence/succession rules.

    "Text": "Let me mentally walk through the model first. The init rule says we must start with Receive_Application (A). That's obvious - you can't process loans without receiving applications. Then the response rule connects A to B (Preliminary_Credit_Check) - so credit check happens immediately after application. Good for preventing delays."

The altprecedence shows Notify_Customer (H) must come after Transfer_Funds (G), which makes sense - you notify after funds move. But the chainprecedence rule is counterintuitive at first: Authorize_Contract_Terms (F) must come before Preliminary_Credit_Check (B)? Wait no - looking back, chainprecedence says F targets B? That seems backwards..."

That can't be right in real life. Unless... maybe it's a hypothetical scenario? realization Wait no - in DECLARE models, target usually indicates what the step leads to, not what comes after. But the user specified target as the next step in the chain. This might be a trick. I should clarify that in my response to avoid confusion."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Biggest insight: The nonchainsuccession rule for Authorize_Contract_Terms  Notify_Customer is key. It means contract authorization must happen before customer notification.
