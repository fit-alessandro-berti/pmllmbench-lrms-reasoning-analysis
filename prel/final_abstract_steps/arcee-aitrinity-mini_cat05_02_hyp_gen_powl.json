    "Text": "Starting with the anomalies in the POWL model. The model has a loop between E Evaluate and P Approve, which could lead to multiple approvals. Then theres an XOR with options N Notify or skip, which might allow skipping notifications. Also, theres a direct edge from A Assign Adjuster to C Close Claim, which seems wrong because closing shouldnt happen without evaluation."

Technical issues like a faulty workflow engine could allow non-standard paths. Inadequate constraints in the tool used to create the model could also be a factor."
