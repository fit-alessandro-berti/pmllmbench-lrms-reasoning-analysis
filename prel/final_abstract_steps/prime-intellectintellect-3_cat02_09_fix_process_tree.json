So the PO creation is in the parallel block and can be done at any time relative to the other parallel activities? That is wrong.) - Specifically, the parallel block allows: - Creating the PO after receiving goods? -> Not allowed. - Paying the invoice before matching? -> Not allowed. - Also, the model does not enforce that the matching must happen after both the goods and the invoice are received?

If we allow parallel, then we break the order? However, the problem does not say that the order of step 4 and 5 is mandatory? It just lists them in that order? However, the problem says the process is intended to follow this standard logic and lists 8 steps. So we are to enforce the order?
