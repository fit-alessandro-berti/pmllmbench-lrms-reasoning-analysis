We can use string_agg to form the variant string, but note: we must order by timestamp. However, note: the problem says to group by the complete activity sequence. We can form a string that represents the sequence (e.g., using string_agg with a delimiter) and then use that for grouping. 2. We then count the number of cases per variant and determine the top K variants. We'll use the variant string as the grouping key. 3.

Note: DENSE_RANK will assign the same rank to the same count, and then the next distinct count gets rank+1. Example: Counts: 10, 10, 9, 9, 8, 8 DENSE_RANK: 1,1,2,2,3,3 If K=3, we get all 6.

We want to include all variants with frequency>=9, so A, B, C, D. But note: the problem says top K variants, and in this example, we are including 4 variants. This is because we are including all variants that are at least as frequent as the K-th variant. This is the typical way to do top K with ties. So I will use this method."

But then we cannot use string_agg for the variant representation, but we can use the array for grouping. However, note: DuckDB supports grouping by arrays?

So we can do: WITH case_variants AS ( SELECT case_id, array_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp) as variant_array FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ) Then we can group by variant_array. This might be more robust if activities contain the string '->'. But the problem does not specify, so we can use either. Since the problem says ordered sequence of activities, using an array is more natural. Let me change to array_agg:"
