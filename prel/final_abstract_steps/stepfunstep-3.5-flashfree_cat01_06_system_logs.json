    "Text": "For FOCUS events what activity name For documents FOCUS likely means the user brought the window to the foreground it could be Open Document if its the first time or Switch to Document if already open But we dont know if the document was already open From context for Quarterly_Report the first FOCUS at 085950 might be opening it since its the first mention Then at 090715 they focus it again after working on Document1 so it was still open So we could call the first Open Document and the second Activate Document or Switch to Document But to standardize maybe all FOCUS on a document are Work on Document"
