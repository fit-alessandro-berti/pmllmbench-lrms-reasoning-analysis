The escalation happens at 11:30, but the investigation doesn't start until 14:00 the same day. Wait, that's a 2.5-hour gap. Then, after investigation, the ticket is resolved the next day at 09:00, which is about 19 hours later. That's a significant wait.

Cases that escalate take much longer because after escalation, the next steps are delayed.\n2. Long waiting times between activities, especially after escalation and after investigation.\n3. Delays in the investigation phase itself. Some cases have quicker investigations, but others take longer, contributing to the overall time."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Why might these delays be happening? Maybe the Level-2 agents are overloaded and can't pick up escalated tickets quickly. Or perhaps there's a communication breakdown after escalation, leading to forgotten tickets. Another possibility is that escalated issues are more complex, requiring more time, but even so, the wait times seem excessive."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "To address these bottlenecks:\n- Improve escalation processes to ensure that Level-2 agents are promptly notified and can start work without delays.\n- Add checks to monitor tickets after escalation to prevent them from being stuck in limbo.\n- Balance the workload of Level-2 agents so that they can handle escalated tickets in a timely manner.\n- Maybe provide Level-1 agents with more training so that fewer tickets need to be escalated, reducing the burden on Level-2.\n- Implement SLAs (Service Level Agreements) with specific timeframes for each activity, especially after escalation and investigation, to ensure that tickets move through the process without unnecessary delays."
