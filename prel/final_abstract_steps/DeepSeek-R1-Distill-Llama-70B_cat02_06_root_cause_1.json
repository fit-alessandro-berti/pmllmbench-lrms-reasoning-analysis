    "Text": "To address these bottlenecks Improve escalation processes to ensure that Level 2 agents are promptly notified and can start work without delays Add checks to monitor tickets after escalation to prevent them from being stuck in limbo Balance the workload of Level 2 agents so that they can handle escalated tickets in a timely manner Maybe provide Level 1 agents with more training so that fewer tickets need to be escalated reducing the burden on Level 2 Implement SLAs Service Level Agreements with specific timeframes for each activity especially after escalation and investigation to ensure that tickets move through the process without unnecessary delays"
