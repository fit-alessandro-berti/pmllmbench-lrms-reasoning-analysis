    "Text": "If the escalation process itself includes manual or time-consuming steps, this could explain the delays. Additionally, Level-1 agents may lack the capacity or expertise to manage some tickets efficiently, leading to unnecessary escalations."

    "Text": "Across all cases with delays, escalation to Level-2 increases resolution times. Cases without escalation (e.g., 101 and 103) closed much faster, suggesting that Level-2 bottlenecks are a major contributor to delays."
