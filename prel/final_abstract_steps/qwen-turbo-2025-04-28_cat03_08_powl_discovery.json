So the nodes in the StrictPartialOrder would include this choice. Let me adjust the model: After AS, theres an XOR between loop_IQC_AS and TST. So the nodes would be: OR, MS, QS, AS, choice_after_AS, TST_loop, PK, LB_choice, DP, D. Where choice_after_AS is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR, children [loop_IQC_AS, TST]. But wait, TST is a Transition, and loop_IQC_AS is an OperatorPOWL. So the choice_after_AS would be X (loop_IQC_AS, TST). Then, the order edges would be: AS -> choice_after_AS choice_after_AS -> TST_loop (if the choice is TST) But wait, if the choice is between loop_IQC_AS and TST, then after choosing TST, you proceed to TST_loop? Or directly to TST? This is getting complicated. Let me think again."

    "Text": "If after AS, theres a choice between:  Taking the loop_IQC_AS (which includes IQC and AS), and then eventually proceeding to TST.  Going directly to TST. So the choice is between loop_IQC_AS and TST. So the structure would be: AS -> X (loop_IQC_AS, TST) -> TST_loop (if TST is chosen, then TST_loop is executed? Or TST is directly executed? Wait, TST_loop is the loop between TST and RT. So if the choice is to go directly to TST, then TST is executed, and then the TST_loop is entered. So the structure would be: AS -> X (loop_IQC_AS, TST) -> TST_loop. But how to model that. The choice_after_AS is X (loop_IQC_AS, TST). Then, after the choice, the TST_loop is executed. So the order edges would be: AS -> choice_after_AS choice_after_AS -> TST_loop But TST_loop is an OperatorPOWL with * (TST, RT). So the TST_loop would be executed after the choice. But how does TST come into play? If the choice is TST, then TST is executed, and then the TST_loop (which is a loop between TST and RT) is entered. But in the current model, the TST_loop is a separate node. This is getting quite complex. Perhaps I should represent the TST_loop as part of the choice. Alternatively, after the choice, if TST is chosen, then TST is executed, and then the TST_loop is entered. But how to model that. Maybe the TST_loop is a separate node, and after the choice, its executed. So the order edges would be: AS -> choice_after_AS choice_after_AS -> TST_loop Then, TST_loop is * (TST, RT). But this would mean that after the choice, TST_loop is executed, which includes TST and RT. But in the case where the choice is TST, the TST is part of the TST_loop. This might not capture the direct path where TST is executed without the loop."

    "Text": "This is getting too tangled. Perhaps the correct approach is to have the choice after AS between the loop_IQC_AS and a direct path to TST, which then leads to the TST_loop. But to simplify, maybe the choice_after_AS is between loop_IQC_AS and a direct TST, and then TST leads to TST_loop. So the structure would be: AS -> X (loop_IQC_AS, TST) -> TST_loop. But then, TST_loop is a node that contains the loop between TST and RT. This would require that the TST is part of the TST_loop. But Im not sure."

Final POWL structure:  The root is a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: OR, MS, QS, AS, loop_IQC_AS, TST_loop, PK, LB_choice, DP, D.  Order edges: OR -> MS -> QS -> AS -> loop_IQC_AS -> TST_loop -> PK -> LB_choice -> DP -> D.  loop_IQC_AS is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children IQC, AS.  TST_loop is an OperatorPOWL with operator LOOP and children TST, RT.  LB_choice is an OperatorPOWL with operator XOR and children LB, skip (SilentTransition). This structure captures the sequential flow, the loops, and the choice for labeling. It allows for multiple iterations of AS and IQC, and multiple TST and RT steps, and the optional LB."
