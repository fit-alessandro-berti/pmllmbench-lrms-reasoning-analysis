My task is to identify those anomalies, generate hypotheses about why they exist, and propose SQL queries to verify them."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Now looking at the DECLARE model: init says R must be first, existence requires C to occur, responded_existence says if E happens, A must also happen, precedence says C must have R before it, and noncoexistence says E and C cannot both occur."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, that last one is a problem. Noncoexistence between E and C means a claim cant have both evaluation and closing. But the intended flow has E before C, so they should coexist. Thats a direct contradiction."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also, precedence requires R before C, which is fine, but noncoexistence prevents E and C together, which conflicts with the normal sequence where E happens before C. Then responded_existence says E implies A, which is okay, but noncoexistence blocks E and C from both happening, so if E is required for C (as per the flow), this rule makes it impossible to have both. That means claims could close without evaluation, which isnt intended."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Hypotheses: Maybe someone misread the requirements, thinking evaluation and closing are mutually exclusive. Or perhaps there was a policy change where certain claim types skip evaluation, but it wasnt applied consistently. Technical issues like data errors might have led to wrong constraints. Or pressure to close claims quickly led to allowing skipping evaluation."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "For SQL queries, I need to check actual traces in claim_events. Find claims with C but no E. Check if any trace has both E and C (which violates noncoexistence). Verify that when E occurs, A also exists in the trace. Also, check if all traces start with R and end with C as per init and existence."
