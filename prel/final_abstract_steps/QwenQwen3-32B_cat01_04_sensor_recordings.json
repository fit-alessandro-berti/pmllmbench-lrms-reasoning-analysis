    "Text": "Starting with Event 1 to 3: The temperature is around 20C, pressure is 1 bar, vibration is 0 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position is 0, and energy is low. This seems like an idle or initialization phase. The machine isnt doing much here, just low activity. So maybe this is the Machine Idle Startup phase."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Then Event 4: Temperature jumps to 50C, pressure stays at 1 bar, vibration increases to 30 Hz, material flow starts at 5 units s, tool position is 5 mm, energy is 2 kWh. This looks like a significant change. High vibration and temperature might indicate a cutting operation. The material flow and tool position moving could be part of cutting metal. So maybe Cutting Metal here."

    "Text": "Event 5 and 6 continue with increasing temperature 55 to 58C, pressure to 1.5 bar, vibration up to 38 Hz, same material flow, tool position increases. This seems like the cutting process is ongoing, so these would be part of the same Cutting Metal activity."

    "Text": "Event 7: Temperature drops to 40C, pressure increases to 2 bar, vibration drops to 10 Hz, material flow is 2 units s, tool position at 15 mm, energy is 2 kWh. The tool position is moving further. Lower vibration but higher pressure. This could be a transition phase, maybe assembling parts where the machine is applying pressure but less vibration. So Assembling Parts here."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 8: Same as 7. Same readings, so same activity, Assembling Parts continues."

    "Text": "Event 9: Temperature spikes to 80C, pressure remains 2 bar, vibration jumps to 50 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position stays at 15 mm, energy is 5 kWh. This is a big increase in temperature and vibration. Since material flow is 0, maybe this is a welding process where the tool is heating up without material flow. So Welding here."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Event 10: Temperature drops to 30C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 1 Hz, material flow 0, tool position 15 mm, energy 1 kWh. This could be a cooling down phase or a quality check. Low vibration and temperature, but tool position remains. Maybe Quality Inspection where the machine checks the welded part."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Event 11 and 12: Temperature and pressure stay low, vibration increases slightly to 5 Hz, material flow starts at 1 unit s, tool position moves to 20 mm. This might be a minor movement or adjustment. Since the flow is low and tool position is moving, maybe this is Adjusting Packaging Setup. But the energy is low, so perhaps its part of packaging. Alternatively, maybe a final adjustment before packaging."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Event 13 to 15: Temperature and pressure return to 20C and 1 bar, vibration and material flow drop to 0, tool position back to 0, energy low. This is the machine returning to idle. So Machine Idle Shutdown here."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now, lets check if these groupings make sense. The cutting phase has high temperature and vibration, which aligns with cutting metal. Assembling would involve applying pressure and moving the tool but lower vibration. Welding requires high heat and vibration without material flow. Quality inspection is a low activity phase after welding. The final adjustment and then shutdown. Each transition makes sense based on the sensor readings. I need to make sure theres no overlap or missed patterns. For example, the tool position increases during cutting and assembling, which could represent different stages of the process. The energy consumption also spikes during cutting and welding, which are energy intensive tasks. The material flow during cutting and assembling suggests material is being processed. The welding phase has no material flow but high energy, indicating a different process. The quality inspection phase is a pause to check the product. The final adjustment might be part of packaging setup, but the data here is limited. Alternatively, the adjustment could be part of moving to the next step. Since the tool position increases again, maybe its part of assembling, but in the data, after assembling events 7 8, the next is welding event 9. Then after welding, quality inspection, then adjustment events 11 12, and then shutdown. The adjustment could be part of packaging setup. However, the data doesnt have many events for packaging. Maybe the adjustment is part of the process before packaging, but the shutdown ends the process. The labels might need to be adjusted if theres a missing phase. But given the data, the grouping seems logical. Each phase has distinct sensor patterns that align with the expected activity."
