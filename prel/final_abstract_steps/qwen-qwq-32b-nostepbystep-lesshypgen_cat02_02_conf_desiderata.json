Comparing this to the required sequence, it looks like all steps are in the right order. The Credit Check comes before Risk Assessment, which is good. Since the decision was approved, they did Finalize Documentation before closing, so that's correct. No violations here."

Wait, no, looking at the table, after Application at 08:00, the next activity is Risk Assessment at 08:20, before the Credit Check. That's a problem because the normative rule says Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a clear violation here."

The desiderata mentions that Credit Check should be done within 24 hours, which was violated here, but since it's a desideratum, not a normative rule, so that's not a normative violation. The activities are in the correct order though: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, so the normative sequence is okay."

Wait, in the log for Case 1, the activities listed don't include a Follow-Up Call. So that's a desideratum violation too, but the question is whether the task requires pointing out all desiderata violations... Wait, looking at the log for Case 3, the note says \"No Follow-up Call\"... The other cases don't have such notes, so maybe only Case 3 is explicitly missing it?... Hmm, perhaps the example is showing that Case 3 didn't have it, but others might have done it or not... Since the table only notes Case 3, I should follow the given data."

Let me check the table again for Case 2... After Loan Decision (Rejected at 09:30), the next activity is Finalize Documentation (10:00). Wait, but according to the normative steps, after Loan Decision, you must Inform Applicant first... Wait the normative sequence requires Loan Decision Inform Applicant... Wait, the normative sequence is: After Loan Decision comes \"Inform Applicant\", then, if approved, Finalize Docs before Close... In Case 2, the Loan Decision was Rejected, so after Decision, they should Inform Applicant before closing, but in the log for Case 2, the log shows after Loan Decision (09:30), the next step is Finalize Documentation (10:00)...
