Core Sequence: After OR, the process goes through MS (Material Sourcing), QS (Quality Screening), and then AS (Assembly). However, note that after Assembly, there is often an IQC (In-line Quality Check) which may lead to a repetition of Assembly (AS) if quality issues are found. 3. Loop in Quality Control: The pattern shows that after AS, there is an IQC, and then sometimes AS again. 4. Testing Phase: After the assembly and quality loop, the product goes to TST (Testing). If the test fails, it goes to RT (Re-Testing) and then back to TST. 5. Packaging and Labeling: After passing the test, the product is packaged (PK). Then, labeling (LB) may or may not occur. 6. Distribution: After packaging (and optionally labeling), the process goes to DP (Distribution Planning) and then D (Dispatch). 7. Variations: - Case 1: ... - Case 5: ..."
