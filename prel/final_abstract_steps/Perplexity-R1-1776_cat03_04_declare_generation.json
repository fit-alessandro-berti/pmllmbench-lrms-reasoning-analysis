The keys like 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init' are for individual activities. Their values are dictionaries where each key is an activity, and the value has support and confidence (both 1.0 here). The other keys like 'response', 'precedence', etc., involve pairs of activities, so their values are dictionaries with tuples as keys representing activity pairs."
