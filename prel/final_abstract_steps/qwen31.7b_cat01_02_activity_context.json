    "Text": "Okay lets tackle this problem step by step First I need to understand the event log provided There are three cases C001 C002 C003 each with various activities The main task is to rename activities that repeat in the same case considering their context based on when they occur Looking at the first case C001 The first activity is Initiate Request at 0915 then Verify Documents at 0920 Then Call Customer at 0945 which is when the agent calls to get missing documents Then Submit Additional at 1010 where the customer uploads an ID scan Then another Verify Documents at 1030 after the ID scan is provided Finally Approve Request at 1045 So the Verify Documents activity is done twice The first time its part of the initial verification and the second time after the ID scan is uploaded"

    "Text": "Next the Call Customer activity happens once after the initial verification and then again after the ID scan The first call is to get missing documents and the second is a follow-up So Call Customer might be renamed to Initial Customer Call and Follow-up Customer Call Another activity in C001 is Submit Additional which is when the customer uploads the ID scan Thats a specific action so maybe keep that as Submit ID Scan Now looking at C002 Initiate Request at 0805 then Verify Documents at 0815 then Call Customer at 0900 which is an outbound call to clarify an account discrepancy Then Adjust Account at 0930 followed by another Call Customer at 0950 and finally Approve Request So the Call Customer is done twice The first is an outbound call the second is a follow-up So Call Customer could be Outbound Customer Call and Follow-up Customer Call The Adjust Account is done after the call so thats a separate activity Maybe keep it as Adjust Account In C003 Initiate Request at 1120 then Verify Documents at 1125 physical verification then Call Customer at 1150 customer is out then Adjust Account at 1205 due to missing info then Verify Documents again and finally Approve Request So the Call Customer is when the customer is out and the Verify Documents after the adjustment So maybe Call Customer becomes Customer Call Out of Presence and Verify Documents after adjustment becomes Post-Adjustment Document Verification"

    "Text": "Now I need to make sure that the renamed activities clearly show the context For example in C001 the first Verify Documents is initial the second is post-ID scan In C002 the first Call Customer is an outbound call the second is a follow-up In C003 the first Call Customer is when the customer is out and the second Verify Documents is after adjustment So the renamed activities should reflect these temporal contexts Also the Submit Additional in C001 is when the customer uploads the ID scan so thats a specific action so maybe keep it as Submit ID Scan"

    "Text": "Now lets structure the revised event log with these renamed activities For each case list the activities with their new names Also justify the renaming choices like why Call Customer was split into two activities based on when the customer was present or not I need to make sure that each activity that repeats is renamed appropriately Lets go through each case again to check C001 Initiate Request first Verify Documents first Call Customer first Submit Additional first Verify Documents second Approve Request second So Verify Documents is repeated The first is initial the second is after ID scan So Initial Document Verification and Post-ID Scan Document Verification Call Customer is first when the customer is present then a follow-up when they are out So Initial Customer Call and Follow-up Customer Call C002 Initiate Request first Verify Documents first Call Customer first Adjust Account second Call Customer second Approve Request second Call Customer is split into Outbound Customer Call and Follow-up Customer Call C003 Initiate Request first Verify Documents first Call Customer first Adjust Account second Verify Documents second Approve Request second Call Customer is split into Customer Call Out of Presence and Post-Adjustment Document Verification for the second Verify Documents"

    "Text": "So the final renamed activities would be For C001 Initiate Request Initial Document Verification Initial Customer Call Submit ID Scan Post-ID Scan Document Verification Approve Request For C002 Initiate Request Initial Document Verification Outbound Customer Call Adjust Account Follow-up Customer Call Approve Request For C003 Initiate Request Initial Document Verification Customer Call Out of Presence Adjust Account Post-Adjustment Document Verification Approve Request Now justifying the names For example Initial Document Verification because its the first time the documents are checked Post-ID Scan Document Verification because its after the ID scan is submitted Outbound Customer Call because its an outbound call to clarify discrepancies Follow-up Customer Call because its a follow-up after the initial call Customer Call Out of Presence because the customer was out when the call was made Post-Adjustment Document Verification because its after the account adjustment I need to make sure that the new names clearly indicate the context Also check if there are any other activities that need renaming For example in C001 Submit Additional is when the customer uploads the ID scan so thats a specific action so its kept as Submit ID Scan Yes that seems to cover all the cases Now present the revised log with these names"
