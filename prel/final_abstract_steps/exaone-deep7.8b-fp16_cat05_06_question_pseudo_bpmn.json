    "Text": "First, Ill start by understanding the process steps. The BPMN starts with market research and RD, then splits into securing components from different countries. After securing, they ship to Malaysia for assembly. Then theres quality checks, rework/scrap, packing, shipping to various markets, customs, distribution, monitoring, and adjusting orders."

    "Text": "Now, the questions should cover each of these areas. Let me brainstorm possible angles for each part. For example, the splitting into component securing could lead to a question about why parallel paths are used and how they coordinate. The quality checks might prompt questions on failure rates or handling defects."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I need to ensure questions are open-ended and thought-provoking. Avoid yes/no questions. Maybe ask about optimal points for risk mitigation, why certain countries are chosen for components, how decisions are made during rework, how stakeholders are involved at each stage, etc."

    "Text": "I should check if I cover all the mentioned areas: process flows, improvements, risks, decisions, communication, performance. Let me list out possible topics: 1. Rationale behind parallel gateways in component securing. 2. Why split into different component securing tasks. 3. Decision points in quality checks and rework. 4. Risk of component shortages and mitigation. 5. Stakeholder communication at each major step. 6. How assembly line efficiency is maintained. 7. Impact of customs on shipping times. 8. Distribution strategies for different markets. 9. How sales forecasts influence inventory. 10. Ethical considerations in supplier selection. 11. Role of local warehouses in distribution. 12. How defects are handled post-assembly. 13. Importance of regulatory compliance in different regions. 14. Impact of quality checks on overall throughput. 15. Why choose air freight over cargo ships for some routes? 16. How does the process adapt to sudden demand changes? 17. Role of monitoring in sales and inventory. 18. Decision-making for adjusting supplier orders. 19. Challenges in global supply chain coordination. 20. Potential bottlenecks and how to alleviate them."
