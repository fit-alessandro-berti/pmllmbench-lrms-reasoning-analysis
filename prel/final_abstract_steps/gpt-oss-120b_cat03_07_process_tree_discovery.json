In our case, loop body is RMI then VF? Actually after RMI, they re-validate form (VF) then maybe again missing info. So loop: A = RMI, B = VF. That means: execute RMI, then either exit or execute VF then RMI again, etc. That matches observed: RMI then VF then maybe RMI again."

Could be that after first RMI, they request again before validation? Could be considered as loop of (RMI, tau) then later VF. But for simplicity, we can accept that loop may repeat with RMI then VF, and the extra RMI can be considered as part of same loop iteration (maybe they request missing info twice before validation)."
