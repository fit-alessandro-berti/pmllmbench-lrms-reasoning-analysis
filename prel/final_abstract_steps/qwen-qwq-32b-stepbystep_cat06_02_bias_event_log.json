    "Text": "So the rules might be If LocalResident and has CommunityGroup cutoff is 700 If LocalResident but no CommunityGroup like C002 cutoff 720 Non Local residents need 720 but with no adjustment In that case having a community group gives a lower cutoff So being part of a community group and local resident gives a lower required score That would mean that even with a lower score they get approved because of their affiliation Thats a form of bias because those without community groups or are non residents are held to a higher standard"

    "Text": "The adjustments are only applied when theres a community group So the scoring system gives a 10 point boost to those in a community group Even if their base score is lower adding 10 might get them to the required cutoff This means that applicants in a community group get an unfair advantage For example C001 started at 710 got 10 to 720 which is the cutoff for non community locals But if they werent in a community group their 710 would have been below the 720 cutoff So the 10 gives them an extra boost to meet the cutoff Similarly C004 had a base of 690 which with 10 becomes 700 If that cutoff for locals with community is 700 then thats exactly the cutoff"

    "Text": "Suppose two applicants Applicant A local in community base 700 10 710 Maybe their cutoff is 700 so they pass Applicant B local no community base 700 no adjustment If cutoff is 720 they would fail Thus the community group gives a better chance Additionally the LocalResident status might also play a role For example non locals have a higher threshold This setup means that being in a community group and being a local resident gives you a better chance even with lower scores"

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "This creates bias because applicants without community groups even if they are locals need a higher score Additionally non locals have to reach 720 without any adjustment The 10 adjustment for community groups is a form of favoritism The scoring engine gives a 10 to those in a community group Thats a direct score boost So even if two people have the same base score the one in a community group gets an extra 10 making them more likely to pass This creates a disparity For example consider two applicants with the same base score but different community group status The one with the group gets the boost and passes while the other doesnt Thus the community group gives an edge This is a clear bias in favor of those in community groups"

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The systems scoring process explicitly adds points based on community group which isnt related to creditworthiness but their community affiliation Therefore the bias is in the 10 adjustment for community groups and possibly lower cutoffs for locals with the group The key points are CommunityGroup gets a 10 which is an unfair advantage Possible lower cutoff for locals with community Non residents cant get the adjustment so their scores need to be higher This leads to unfairness because two people with the same preliminary score but one has a community group would get the boost and pass while the other without is rejected"
