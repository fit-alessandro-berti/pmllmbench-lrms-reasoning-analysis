Looking at Case C001: The applicant is a LocalResident (TRUE), part of the Highland Civic Darts Club. Their PreliminaryScore was 710, then got a +10 adjustment, making it 720, and they were approved. Case C002 is also a LocalResident, but no CommunityGroup. Their PreliminaryScore was 720, no adjustment, and they were approved. Wait, but their PreliminaryScore was already 720, so maybe the base score is higher here? Hmm, but the adjustment was 0. Case C003: Not a LocalResident (FALSE), no CommunityGroup. Their score was 715, no adjustment, and they were rejected. Case C004: Another LocalResident in the same CommunityGroup. Their preliminary was 690, got +10 to 700, and approved. Case C005: Not a LocalResident, no CommunityGroup, but a higher score of 740, got no adjustment, and was approved."
