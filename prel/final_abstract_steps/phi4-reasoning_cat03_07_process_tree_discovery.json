So that fits: If the missing info loop is executed, then the loop body is: first RMI and if loop continues it repeats; eventually, when exiting the loop, you execute VF (the re-validation), which then leads to AD.\n\nBut what about the fact that in case 1, there's only one RMI event before the re-validation? And in case 3, there are two consecutive RMI events. The process tree as written \"* (RMI, VF)\" means: Execute RMI, if you decide not to exit then execute VF and again RMI, etc. That is slightly different order than what we want because in our log the \"VF\" happens after finishing all missing info requests."

But in the \"* (RMI, VF)\" construction, what happens is: first iteration does RMI, then if not exit, does VF and then does another RMI...
