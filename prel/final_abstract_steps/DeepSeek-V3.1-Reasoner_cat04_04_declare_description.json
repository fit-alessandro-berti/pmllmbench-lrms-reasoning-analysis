    "Text": "I should start by breaking down the process into logical phases, as the model suggests a structured flow. The constraints clearly indicate an initiation phase, a verification phase, an assembly phase, and a finalization phase. I'll map each constraint to real-world steps, explaining why they exist like regulatory compliance or risk management."
