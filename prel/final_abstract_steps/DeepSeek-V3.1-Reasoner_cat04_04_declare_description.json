    "Text": "I should start by breaking down the process into logical phases, as the model suggests a structured flow. The constraints clearly indicate an initiation phase, a verification phase, an assembly phase, and a finalization phase. Ill map each constraint to real-world steps, explaining why they existlike regulatory compliance or risk management."

    "Text": "I need to ensure I cover all constraints, especially the negative ones like absence and noncoexistence, which are crucial for compliance. The forbidden activity Proceed_Without_Compliance is a key pointits there to prevent shortcuts that could lead to legal or financial risks."

    "Text": "The response should be practical and avoid overly technical jargon, making it accessible while still precise. The user provided detailed activity descriptions, so Ill use those to keep the explanation grounded in real-world actions. The goal is to show how the model enforces a robust, compliant process and what could go wrong if its not followed."
