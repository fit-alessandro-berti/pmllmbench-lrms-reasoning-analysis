    "Text": "Okay, I need to create a BPMN-like textual model based on the provided transcripts. Let me go through each transcript step by step and note down the key elements. Starting with the Accounts Payable Clerk (Mary) in Interview 1. She processes an invoice, checks for a PO, logs it, sends to purchasing, confirms goods received, matches PO with invoice, sends confirmation to manager, and schedules payment. So, activities are checking PO, logging, forwarding, confirming goods, matching PO, sending confirmation, sending to manager, scheduling. Interview 2 by Dan: Similar to Mary but mentions that sometimes an invoice number is missing. He cant proceed without the PO and sends an email if discrepancy is too big. Interview 3 by Carlos: Hes usually last, confirming everything, but may reject or investigate if suspicious, then sends it back. So confirm, reject, investigate. Interview 4 by Rita: Escalates to her role when there are exceptions. She might hand off to AP or Purchasing and ensure the invoice can clear. Interview 5 by Karen: Asks for relationships with suppliers or revises invoices when needed. She helps resolve issues without directly handling approvals."
