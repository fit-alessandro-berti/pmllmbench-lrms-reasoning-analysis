    "Text": "Looking at Case 1001 first The activities are Create Requisition Approve Issue PO Receive Goods Vendor Invoice Received Match Invoice Release Payment Close That seems in order Create Requisition first makes sense then approve issue PO then receive goods get the invoice match pay and close So nothing unusual here"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Moving on to Case 1002 The activities are Create Requisition Issue PO Vendor Invoice Received Release Payment Approve Requisition Receive Goods Match Invoice Close Wait that doesnt seem right In the standard process you dont issue a PO before approving the requisition Usually after creating the requisition its approved then the PO is issued Here they created the requisition then immediately issued the PO without approval Thats a problem because approving the requisition should come before issuing the PO Without approval issuing the PO might be unauthorized"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also after issuing the PO they received the vendor invoice and released payment before approving the requisition Thats a big issue because releasing payment without proper approvals can lead to unauthorized spending or fraud Moreover they received the invoice before getting the goods which is a bit odd because usually goods are received before the invoice is processed"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also in this case the approve activity comes after releasing payment and receiving the invoice Thats out of order because approvals should happen early in the process not after payments have been made This could indicate that the approval step was missed initially or done too late leading to potential financial risks"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next looking at Case 1003 The activities are Create Requisition Approve Issue PO Release Payment Vendor Invoice Received Receive Goods Match Invoice Close Hmm the order here is a bit off After issuing the PO they released payment immediately Usually you dont release payment right after issuing the PO without receiving the goods and processing the invoice Releasing payment too early could lead to issues if the goods arent received or if theres an invoice discrepancy"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also they received the vendor invoice after releasing payment which is not the standard flow Normally you process the invoice after receiving the goods and before releasing payment Releasing payment before receiving the invoice could mean paying without proper documentation which is risky"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In this case they also received goods after releasing payment which is the reverse of the standard process You should receive goods first then process the invoice and then release payment This could lead to paying for goods that havent been received or verified which is a control issue"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Lastly Case 1004 Create Requisition Approve Receive Goods Issue PO Vendor Invoice Received Match Invoice Release Payment Close Here they received goods before issuing the PO Thats unusual because you should issue the PO first then receive the goods Issuing the PO after receiving goods could mean that the purchase wasnt properly authorized beforehand leading to potential unauthorized purchases or discrepancies in the ordering process"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Additionally they issued the PO after receiving goods which breaks the sequence The standard flow requires the PO to be issued before goods are received to ensure that the purchase was authorized This could lead to situations where goods are received without a corresponding PO making it difficult to match invoices and control costs"

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "So summarizing the anomalies Case 1002 Issued PO without prior approval released payment before approval received invoice before goods and approved after payment Case 1003 Released payment before receiving goods and invoice received invoice after payment and received goods after payment Case 1004 Received goods before issuing PO which disrupts the authorization sequence"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "These anomalies are problematic because they can lead to unauthorized transactions missing approvals payment discrepancies and potential fraud Proper controls are essential in P2P to ensure that each step is followed correctly to prevent financial losses and maintain accountability"
