From the code, it looks like there are several types of constraints: init, existence, responded_existence, precedence, and noncoexistence. Each of these has some activities associated with them, like R for Receive, A for Assign, E for Evaluate, and so on."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

I think it means that if activity E (Evaluate Claim) occurs in a trace, then activity A (Assign Adjuster) must also occur in that trace, either before or after E.

    "Text": "Noncoexistence for E and C: This seems to say that activities E (Evaluate Claim) and C (Close Claim) cannot both occur in the same trace.

But wait, actually, in the intended flow, A should happen before E, not just co-occur in the trace. The responded existence only ensures that A occurs somewhere in the trace if E does, but not necessarily before E."
