    "Text": "From events 4-7, a significant increase in temperature (above 50Â°C), material flow, and energy usage suggests that this phase is active processing. Based on the pattern, I deduced this corresponds to a cutting phase."

    "Text": "Event 8 shows a noticeable drop in material flow and energy while maintaining normal temperature and pressure. This matches a pattern of cooldown or break phase."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Event 9 shows a significant spike in vibration (50Hz) and energy usage (5.00 kWh) while material flow is zero. This suggests a potential transition to a new phase of processing, possibly welding or moving to the next stage."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Events 10-12 match the pattern of low sensor readings similar to events 1-3, suggesting the start of a new operational cycle. This confirms the earlier interpretation of cyclic behavior in the process."
