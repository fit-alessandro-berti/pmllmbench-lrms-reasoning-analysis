    "Text": "Verification SQL queries need to check specific time intervals. For R-P, select claims where the time between Receive and Approve is consistently around 25 hours with little variance. For P-N, find claims with over 7 days or less than 5 days between Approve and Notify. For A-C, claims closed within 2 hours of assignment without Evaluate or Approve. For E-N, notifications within minutes of Evaluate."
