Gateway XOR If feasible prepare custom quotation if not send rejection and end. 5. Convergence After either path it goes to the approval gateway. 6. Gateway XOR Is Approval Needed Decides if approval is required. 7. If Approval Needed Task F Obtain Manager Approval. Gateway XOR If granted generate invoice if not re evaluate and loop back. 8. Loop Back Specifically for custom back to Task E1 for standard back to Task D. 9. Final Steps Generate invoice if approved or not needed then send confirmation and end."
