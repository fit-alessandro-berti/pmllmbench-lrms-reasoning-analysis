    "Text": "Starting with Part 1: The normative process behavior has strict rules. The process must follow a specific sequence. Let me list out the steps again to make sure I have them right. The sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  (If Approved: Finalize Documentation)  Close Case."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The key constraints are that the order must be strictly followed. So, for example, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and Risk Assessment before Loan Decision. Also, after the Loan Decision, you have to Inform the Applicant. Then, if approved, finalize documentation before closing. If rejected, close without finalizing."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 1: - The activities are in the correct order: Application Received, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. All steps are followed in sequence. No violations here. The timing for Credit Check is 30 minutes after application, which is within 24 hours, so thats good. Inform Applicant is 2 hours after decision, which is within 48 hours. The follow-up call isnt mentioned, but thats a desideratum, not a strict rule. So Case 1 is compliant."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 2: - Application Received. Then directly to Risk Assessment without Credit Check. Thats a violation of the normative rule because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then later, they do the Credit Check, but the order is wrong. Also, after Loan Decision (Rejected), they do Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed. Then Close Case. So two violations here: 1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and 2) Finalize Documentation after rejection. So Case 2 is violating the normative rules."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3: - Application Received. Then Credit Check happens two days later. The normative rules dont have a time constraint, but the desiderata says Credit Check should be within 24 hours. So thats a desideratum violation. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant 2 days after decision. The desiderata says Inform Applicant within 48 hours of decision, which is 2 days, so thats exactly 48 hours. Wait, the timestamp for Inform Applicant is 2024-01-16 15:00. The Loan Decision was on 2024-01-14 12:00. The time between is 2 days and 3 hours, which is over 48 hours. So thats a desideratum violation. Then Finalize Documentation and Close Case. The follow-up call is missing, another desideratum. So Case 3 has desideratum violations but no normative rule violations. The sequence is correct: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform, Finalize, Close. So no normative violations here."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Now, for the second part, the desiderata. The desiderata are the timing and follow-up call. So for Case 3, the Credit Check is more than 24 hours after application. The Inform Applicant is more than 48 hours after decision. And no follow-up call. So those are the desiderata issues."

    "Text": "For the third part, possible interpretations. For Case 2, the Risk Assessment before Credit Check might be an error, but maybe they had to do it in a different order due to some system error or manual intervention. The Finalize Documentation after rejection could be a mistake, perhaps the system allowed it, but they should have followed the rules. For Case 3, the delays might be due to external factors like processing delays, or maybe the applicant was unavailable, hence the follow-up call wasnt done. But since these are just recommendations, they can be justified as not critical."
