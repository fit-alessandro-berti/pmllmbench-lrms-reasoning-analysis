I need to represent various steps in the process as transitions and the states between them as places. There are some loops in the process, like re-submitting documents or conducting multiple in-depth investigations, which makes it a bit complex. But I think I can handle it by breaking it down step by step."

Let's list out the activities: [...] These loops need to be represented in the Petri net with appropriate conditions, but since Petri nets are workflow nets without conditions, I'll have to model them in a way that allows for multiple traversals through certain transitions."
