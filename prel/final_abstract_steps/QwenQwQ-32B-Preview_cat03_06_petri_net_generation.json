I need to represent various steps in the process as transitions and the states between them as places. There are some loops in the process, like re-submitting documents or conducting multiple in-depth investigations, which makes it a bit complex. But I think I can handle it by breaking it down step by step."

This way, whether AP is performed or not, the process can proceed to P7 and onwards. This seems correct."
