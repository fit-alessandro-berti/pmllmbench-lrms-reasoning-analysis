First, the problem mentions that certain decisions like Approve, Reject, or RequestAdditionalInfo might be influenced by sensitive attributes like ApplicantAge, Gender, Race. The goal is to add constraints that prevent discrimination based on these. The example given model includes various DECLARE constraints. My task is to add new ones that enforce fairness. Let me recall the possible constraints from DECLARE that could be useful here."

Coexistence Constraints: The idea here is that if a decision involving a sensitive attribute is made (like Approve_Minority or Reject_Minority), then a ManualReview must coexist. So, whenever such a decision exists in a trace, ManualReview must also exist. Therefore, for each sensitive decision activity, add a coexistence constraint with ManualReview. But in the given model, I dont see such specific activities like Approve_Minority. Maybe the model should include them. But perhaps the actual added constraints would involve hypothetical activities, so I can assume those activities exist."

Alternatively, perhaps the decision activities themselves are split by sensitive attributes. So I might add coexistence between, say, Reject_Minority and ManualReview. But since the exact activity names are not given, maybe we can create them. For example, if the process includes Reject_Minority, then we need to ensure that ManualReview exists whenever that happens. Wait, maybe in the current model, the FinalDecision is a generic activity. So perhaps the original model doesnt have specific activities for sensitive groups. This might be part of the problem. Therefore, perhaps the solution involves adding constraints that when a check on a sensitive attribute is made (like CheckApplicantRace), certain steps must follow."

For example, if theres an activity CheckApplicantRace, then the process must ensure that a decision (like Reject) cant immediately follow that without a BiasMitigationCheck. So, for the example, adding constraints like: Coexistence: Any decision activity (like Reject, Approve) that follows a sensitive check (CheckApplicantRace) must coexist with a ManualReview. But how to model that. Let me see the possible DECLARE constraints. Coexistence between two activities A and B means that if A occurs, B must also occur, and vice versa. So, if a decision activity (e.g., Reject) occurs after a sensitive check (CheckApplicantRace), perhaps we need to enforce that ManualReview coexists with these decisions. Alternatively, the problem suggests: Coexistence: If a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant (e.g., Reject_Minority), ensure ManualReview coexists. So in the model, if such an activity is present, add a coexistence between Reject_Minority and ManualReview."

Wait, non-succession is a constraint where if A occurs, B cannot occur later. But maybe nonsuccession is a DECLARE constraint that states that if A occurs, B cannot occur after A.
