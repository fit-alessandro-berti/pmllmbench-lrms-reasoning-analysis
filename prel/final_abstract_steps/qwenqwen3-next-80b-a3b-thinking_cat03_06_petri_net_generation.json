The process starts with the Insurance Claim (C), then goes through several steps. Let me list out all the steps mentioned: 1. Claim Registration (CR) 2. Document Verification (DV) 3. Fraud Check (FC) 4. Claim Assessment (CA) 5. Approval (AP) only if amount exceeds threshold 6. Payment (P) 7. Notification (N) 8. Closure (CL)"

Wait, the problem says: if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues. So after DV, if documents are incomplete, they need to resubmit. So the flow would be DV RDS DV again? Or maybe RDS is part of the process after DV fails. Similarly, for Fraud Check (FC), if doubts are raised, in-depth investigation (II) is performed, which can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA. So FC might loop back to II multiple times."

So RDS would be a transition that leads back to DV. Similarly, for FC: if fraud check passes, proceed to CA. If doubts, then do II, then go back to FC. So FC II FC loop. But the problem says this can happen multiple times before proceeding to CA. So after II, it might go back to FC again."

    "Text": "Also, Approval (AP) is only when the amount surpasses a threshold. So perhaps CA leads to AP only if amount is high. Wait, but how to model that? Because maybe AP is optional. So CA might have two paths: one where AP is needed (if amount high), and another where it's not. But the problem says the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So maybe CA determines whether AP is needed. So CA could lead to AP if threshold exceeded, else directly to P. But how to model that in Petri net? Maybe using a choice point. So after CA, there's a choice: if amount is above threshold, then AP, else go to P. But Petri nets don't have conditional branching like that. Wait, in Petri nets, the transitions can have conditions, but usually the structure is designed with places that represent the state."

    "Text": "In Petri nets, you can have a choice by having a place that has multiple outgoing transitions. So for example: CA transition leads to a place CA Complete. Then from CA Complete, there's a transition AP and a transition Skip AP. But how to model Skip AP as a transition. But in reality, the Skip AP would not be a separate transition. Instead, perhaps the CA leads to a place that allows two paths: one where AP is done, and another where it's not. So perhaps the structure is: CA CA Complete [AP or P] But how to model that. Let's think of a place after CA. Let's say CA leads to place X. Then from X, there's a transition to AP, and a transition to P. But that would mean that after CA, the token can go to either AP or P. But in reality, it's either one or the other. So that's a choice. So that's acceptable. So in the Petri net, the place X would have two outgoing transitions: one for AP and one for P. But then, after AP, you go to P. So AP leads to a place that then goes to P. So the structure would be: CA X AP Y P and X P directly. But that would mean that sometimes P happens without AP. But in reality, if AP is required, then X AP Y P. If not, X P. So yes. So in the model, X would have two outgoing transitions. But how to model that."

    "Text": "Let me recall: in Petri nets, transitions are the activities, and places are the states. So when a transition fires, it consumes tokens from input places and produces tokens in output places. So P transition would have two possible input places: CA Complete (if skipping AP) and AP Complete (if AP was done). So yes. So P transition has two input places: CA Complete and AP Complete."

Similarly, rds transition's output is rds_complete. rds_complete dv transition (arc). Similarly, fc_complete has two outgoing transitions: ca and ii. So fc_complete ca transition and fc_complete ii transition. ii transition's output is ii_complete. ii_complete fc transition (arc). ca transition's input is fc_complete. So fc_complete ca transition. ca transition's output is ca_complete. ca_complete ap transition and ca_complete p transition. ap transition's output is ap_complete. ap_complete p transition. p transition's inputs are ca_complete and ap_complete. Wait, no. Because p transition consumes tokens from either ca_complete or ap_complete. So the arcs would be: ca_complete p transition (arc), ap_complete p transition (arc). Yes.

Let me check if all arcs are correctly added. For example, after ca_complete, there are two arcs: to ap and to p. Yes. ap transition has arc from ca_complete to ap, then ap to ap_complete. ap_complete to p. p transition has input from ca_complete (arc from ca_complete to p) and ap_complete (arc from ap_complete to p). Yes. Yes. So the code seems correct."
