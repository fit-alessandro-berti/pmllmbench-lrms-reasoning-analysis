So, the code would be: node_da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI]); node_da_aci.order = {} # No edges added... But how to represent that in code?... Wait, perhaps the code should not add any edges between DA and ACI... But in the example, the PO is a strict partial order with nodes, and the order is added with edges... So, if two nodes are in the same partial order, they are not connected by an edge. So, the code would have: node_da_aci = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI]); node_da_aci.order = {} # No edges added... But how is that done in the code? The order is a property of the node... So, perhaps the code for DA and ACI is a node with no edges between them... So, the code would have node_da_aci as a node with children DA and ACI, and no edges between them.

DA and ACI are in the same partial order with no edges between them... loop is an OperatorPOWL... connected to X node... QA and SA are in the same partial order... GLA node is connected to QA and SA via edges... But the code needs to be written with all these nodes and edges... # Create the nodes... # Create the loop node... # Create the x node... # Create the partial orders [da_aci and qa_sa nodes created here - this contradicts the later structure]... # Connect SR to CS # Connect the loop node to x_node... # Connect the GLA to QA and SA... root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop_node, x_node, qa_sa, GLA])... But the QA and SA are in the same partial order, so they are not connected by an edge. However, the code adds edges from QA and SA to GLA. This seems correct... But the root is a StrictPartialOrder with these nodes... But the initial step is SR -> CS... So, the code would have the SR node connected to CS node... Wait, the initial step is that the process starts with SR... So, the SR node is connected to CS node... So, the code would have: # Connect SR to CS... root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS])... But earlier, the code had da_aci as a node... So, the root is now the main process, which includes SR, CS, loop_node, x_node, qa_sa, GLA... But the code needs to have all these nodes and edges... So, putting it all together: root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, loop_node, x_node, qa_sa, GLA])... root.order.add_edge(SR, CS)... But the nodes are SR, CS, loop_node, x_node, qa_sa, GLA... But the loop_node's children are BNC and DR... So, the loop_node is connected to BNC and DR... But in the code, the loop_node is part of the root's nodes, and the children are not directly added... So, the loop_node's children are BNC and DR, which are part of the nodes in the root's nodes... So, the code is correct... Thus, the final code would have the root as the main process, with all the nodes and edges as described."
