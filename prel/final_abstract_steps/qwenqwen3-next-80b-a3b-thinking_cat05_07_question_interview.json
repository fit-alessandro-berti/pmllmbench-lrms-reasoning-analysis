How do you handle situations where the landlord refuses to make repairs? - For tenant screening: How do you ensure tenant selection is fair and compliant with housing laws, especially when multiple applicants are qualified? - For exceptions: Can you walk me through a recent exception case (e.g., a property needing special insurance) and how it was handled differently? - Timing: Whats the average time from initial contact to property activation? Where are the biggest bottlenecks? - Handoffs: Between which teams or roles are handoffs most prone to miscommunication, and how is that mitigated? - Quality checks: What happens if a compliance officer finds an issue with the lease after its been signed? Is there a process to correct it before move-in? - Communication: How is information shared between regional offices and field teams when a property is in a different city? Are there standard protocols for urgent issues? - Post-activation: After activation, whats the process for handling tenant applications? How do you track applications and ensure no delays in screening? - Metrics: What key metrics does the company track for this process (e.g., time-to-lease, cost per property onboarding)? How are those used to improve the process?"

    "Text": "Let me draft a comprehensive list. Start with the beginning: - Before the property coordinator begins reviewing documentation, are there any initial eligibility criteria that determine whether the company will even consider taking on a new property? If so, what are they? - When documentation is missing or outdated, what is the typical process for requesting updates from the landlord? How long do you allow for this before escalating or reconsidering the property? For property manager assignment: - When assigning a property manager, how are conflicts resolved if a manager has the right geography but is overloaded, versus another who has capacity but less experience with the property type? - Are there specific training or certification requirements for property managers handling certain property types (e.g., luxury units or student housing)? For inspection and repairs: - What is the protocol if the inspector identifies critical safety issues that require immediate attention? How quickly must repairs be made, and who is responsible for coordinating them? - How are repair costs and timelines communicated to the landlord? What happens if the landlord disputes the need for repairs or refuses to pay? For marketing and activation: - After the marketing team creates listings, what steps ensure that the pricing and descriptions are accurate before activation? Is there a final sign-off by the property manager? - What triggers the activation of the property in the system? Is it automated after inspection passes, or manually initiated? For tenant screening: - How do you standardize tenant screening criteria across different regions to ensure compliance with local laws while maintaining consistency in tenant quality? - When multiple qualified applicants are interested, what specific factors influence the final selection? Are there any internal guidelines or scoring systems? For exceptions: - Can you describe a recent exception case (e.g., a landlord requesting custom lease terms that conflict with company policy) and how it was resolved? What was the escalation path? - For properties requiring special insurance, what is the process for obtaining and verifying that insurance before onboarding? For communication and tracking: - How is communication between the regional office, property manager, landlord, and support teams documented and tracked? Are there specific tools or protocols to prevent information from being lost in email threads? - What are the most common communication breakdowns in this process, and how have you addressed them? For timing and metrics: - What is the average time from initial contact to property activation, and what are the top three factors that cause delays? - How do you measure the success of this onboarding process? Are there key performance indicators tracked for each stage? For handoffs: - At which points in the process are handoffs between teams most critical, and how do you ensure smooth transitions? For example, when does the property manager hand off to the leasing agent for tenant screening? - If a step in the process is delayed (e.g., inspection takes longer than expected), how does that affect downstream tasks? For quality checks: - What happens if the compliance officer identifies a fair housing issue in the lease agreement after its signed but before move-in? Is there a process to correct it? - How often are internal audits conducted on completed onboarding processes, and what are common findings? Also, for the database: Who is responsible for updating the property database if details change during the onboarding process (e.g., after repairs are made)? And for pricing: How are market trends incorporated into pricing decisions? Is there a dedicated team for this, or does the property manager adjust based on their knowledge?"

Also, for the assignment of property manager: if workload is a factor, how do they handle high-demand periods?"
