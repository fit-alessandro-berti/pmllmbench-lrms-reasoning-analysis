    "Text": "Okay, the user has shared a detailed description of a property onboarding process for a large-scale property management company. They want me to create a list of targeted open-ended questions to clarify and improve understanding of this process. The questions should focus on uncovering missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, sequencing, and exception handling—without asking for SQL or implementation details."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at the description, there are several stages: initial contact, documentation review, assignment of property manager, meetings, photography/inspection, marketing, tenant screening, lease finalization, and quality checks. Each stage has potential pain points. For example, the documentation review step mentions missing or outdated documents, but it does not say how often that happens or what the common issues are. That is a good area to probe."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "I should structure my questions to cover each phase but also look cross-functionally. Questions about exceptions are crucial because real-world processes often break down there. The description mentions special cases like unique insurance or custom lease clauses, so I need to ask how those are handled differently."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For roles and responsibilities: it says a property coordinator reviews docs, then a property manager is assigned, but what about the leasing agent? When do they get involved? The description says property manager or a leasing agent handles tenant screening, but it is vague. Clarifying who does what when would help. For timing and sequencing: how long does each step take? Are there SLAs? The process seems sequential, but are there parallel activities? For decision criteria: for assigning property managers, they mention workload, geography, experience, etc. But how are these weighted? If two managers are equally qualified, what breaks the tie? That is important for understanding consistency."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I need to avoid yes/no questions. All should be open-ended to get detailed answers. Start with broader questions about the process flow, then drill into specifics."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "The description starts with landlord contacting them, but do they have criteria for accepting properties? Like, minimum size, location, condition? The description does not say—they just say if documentation is verified, but maybe there is a pre-qualification step... Another gap: the process describes handling the property once it is accepted, but what if the landlord withdraws during the process? How is that handled? Or if the property is sold during onboarding?"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let me brainstorm specific questions: On documentation review: What are the most common reasons for documentation being missing or outdated, and how does that impact the timeline? For property manager assignment: How are conflicts resolved if multiple factors pull in different directions for manager assignment? For inspection issues: When repairs are needed, what is the typical process for communicating with the landlord about costs and timelines? For tenant screening: How do you ensure tenant selection is fair and compliant with housing laws, especially when multiple applicants are qualified? For exceptions: Can you walk me through a recent exception case and how it was handled differently?"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think these cover it. Now, I need to phrase them as open-ended questions without being leading. Use how, what, can you describe, etc. Avoid yes/no. For example, instead of Do you have a checklist for the intro meeting? ask What topics are typically covered during the introductory meeting between the property manager and landlord? Yes. So final list should be around 10-15 questions, comprehensive but not overwhelming."
