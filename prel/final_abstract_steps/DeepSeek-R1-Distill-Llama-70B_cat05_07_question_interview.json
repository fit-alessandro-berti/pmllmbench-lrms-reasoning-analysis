If anythings missing, they ask for updates. Once everythings verified, they enter the details into a database. Then a property manager is assigned based on several factors like workload, geography, experience, and track record. After that, theres an introductory meeting, then scheduling a photographer and inspector. The inspectors report might require repairs, then marketing happens, the property is activated, tenant screening, lease finalization, and finally quality checks and audits."
