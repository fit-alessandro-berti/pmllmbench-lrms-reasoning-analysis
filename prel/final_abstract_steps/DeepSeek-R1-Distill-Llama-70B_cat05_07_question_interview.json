    "Text": "First, let me go through the process step by step as described. The process starts with a landlord contacting the regional office, then a property coordinator reviews the documents. If anything's missing, they ask for updates. Once everything's verified, they enter the details into a database. Then a property manager is assigned based on several factors like workload, geography, experience, and track record. After that, there's an introductory meeting, then scheduling a photographer and inspector. The inspector's report might require repairs, then marketing happens, the property is activated, tenant screening, lease finalization, and finally quality checks and audits."
