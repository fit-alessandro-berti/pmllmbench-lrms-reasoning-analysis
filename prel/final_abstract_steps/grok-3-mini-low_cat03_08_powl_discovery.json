TST follows, and if it fails, RT leads back to TST, indicating a loop. After successful testing, PK, and optionally LB, which is sometimes skipped. Then DP and D. From the examples: In Case 1: OR MS QS AS IQC AS TST RT TST PK LB DP D. Case 2: Similar but skips LB. Case 3: More IQC and AS repetitions. Case 4: Skips IQC and goes straight to TST after AS. Case 5: Multiple RT and TST loops."

TST and RT: If testing fails, RT leads back to TST, so thats a loop. Choices: LB is sometimes skipped, so theres a choice: do LB or not. In Case 4, IQC is skipped, so perhaps after QS, theres a choice to do IQC or go directly to AS or TST."

Loops: For the testing part, * (TST, RT) means execute TST, then either exit or execute RT and then TST again. For IQC and AS, it might be a loop where AS is repeated after IQC. Choices: For LB, its a choice between doing LB or skipping it, so X(LB, skip). The overall process has a partial order: some activities must follow others, but from the log, it seems mostly sequential. Sketch a high-level structure: Start with OR. Then MS. Then QS. After QS, perhaps a sequence leading to AS, with possible loops for IQC and AS. A block for assembly and IQC: This involves AS and IQC in a loop. A block for testing: TST with possible RT loop. Then PK. Choice for LB. DP. D."

After QS, have a choice: enter the IQC-AS loop or skip it and go to TST. For skipping, use choice with a silent transition. So, after QS, have a XOR choice between IQC-AS loop and a silent transition to TST."

After QS, have XOR_QS_next = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[IQC_AS_loop, skip_to_TST]) Then, in the partial order, QS XOR_QS_next TST_loop etc. And silent_to_TST would be a silent transition that leads to TST_loop.
