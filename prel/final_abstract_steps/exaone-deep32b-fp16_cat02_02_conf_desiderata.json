Here, Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check before Risk Assessment). So that's a normative violation. Then, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation. But according to the rules, if rejected, you cant finalize before closing. Thats another violation. So two violations here: first the Credit Check after Risk Assessment, and second finalizing after rejection."

Then the Inform Applicant happens on the 16th Thats over 48, so thats a desideratum violation. Also, theres no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is a desideratum but not required.
