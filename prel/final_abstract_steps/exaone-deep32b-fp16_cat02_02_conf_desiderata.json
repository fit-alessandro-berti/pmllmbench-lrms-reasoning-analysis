The user provided two parts: Part 1 is the strict rules, and Part 2 are the recommended but not strict guidelines. The event logs for three cases are given, and I need to check which ones violate the strict rules and which ones just miss the recommendations."

    "Text": "Starting with the first task: identifying violations of normative rules. Let's look at each case one by one. Case 1: The steps are in order: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Doc → Close. That follows the sequence exactly. The approved path requires finalize before closing, which they did. So no violations here. All steps in order, no skips. So Case 1 is okay."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 2: Looking at the events here. The first step after application is Risk Assessment at 08:20, but before that, there should be a Credit Check. The Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Here, Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. That's a violation of the ordering rule (Credit Check before Risk Assessment). Then, after the Loan Decision (Rejected), they did Finalize Documentation. But according to the rules, if rejected, you can't finalize before closing. After rejection, they go to Finalize Doc and then close. That's another violation. So two violations here."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3: Application received on the 12th. Then Credit Check on the 14th, which is 48 hours later (since 12th to 14th is two days, so 48 hours). The desideratum says Credit Check should be within 24 hours. So that's a desideratum violation, but not a normative one. Then the Inform Applicant happens on the 16th, which is 4 days after the loan decision (too late based on the 48-hour recommendation). Also, there's no Follow-up Call mentioned, which is a desideratum but not required. So the normative rules here are followed: the steps are in order. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, then decision, inform, then finalize and close."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now, moving to the second task: desiderata violations. For Case 3, the Credit Check took more than 24 hours (so over 24h, which is a violation of the first desideratum). The informing was after 48 hours (actually longer), so that's another. Also, missing the follow-up call. But those are all desiderata, so not strict."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Possible justifications for Case 2's first violation (Risk before Credit Check): maybe there was an error in the process, like a staff member forgot to do the credit check first. Alternatively, maybe the system allowed the Risk Assessment to proceed without checking? The second violation (finalize after rejection) could be a mistake in the process, like an employee thought the rejection still needed docs, but the rules say no."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For Case 3's desiderata issues: maybe the Credit Check was delayed due to some issue (like processing time), but it's still a violation of the recommendation. The late inform could be due to administrative delays. The missing follow-up call might be an oversight but not a critical error."

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, let me check Case 2 again. The events for Case 2: Application at 08:00, Risk Assessment at 08:20 (no prior Credit Check), Credit Check at 08:30, Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30. After the Loan Decision, Finalize Doc was done at 10:00, but Inform Applicant was missing entirely. That's another normative violation. So Case 2 has three violations: Risk before Credit, skipped Inform Applicant, and Finalize Doc after rejection."
