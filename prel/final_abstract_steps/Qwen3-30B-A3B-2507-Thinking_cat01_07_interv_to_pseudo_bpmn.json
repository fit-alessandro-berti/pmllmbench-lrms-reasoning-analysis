Mary Accounts Payable Clerk describes the initial steps checking PO validity, logging, forwarding to Purchasing, matching, and manager approval. Dan Purchasing Officer confirms the PO details and sends confirmation. Carlos Department Manager handles final approval with possible rejections. Rita Supervisor manages exceptions, and Karen Supplier Manager resolves supplier-related issues."

    "Text": "Hmm, there are some important points to consolidate. The PO validation step appears critical Mary checks for PO presence first, and Dan mentions they never approve without it. I should note that missing PO triggers different paths. Also, discrepancies can happen at multiple points during Marys matching invoice vs PO or Carloss review suspicious items."

    "Text": "Let me structure the flow logically 1. Invoice arrival PO check Mary 2. PO missing escalate to supplier Karen or send back 3. PO present log forward to Purchasing Dan 4. Dans confirmation check if mismatch, contact supplier Karen or hold 5. If confirmed, send to Manager Carlos 6. Carloss approval if reject, send back to Mary for resolution 7. Approved payment scheduling."
