Alternatively, I can use STRING_AGG with ORDER BY. Wait, in DuckDB, STRING_AGG allows an ORDER BY clause. So perhaps: WITH sequence_per_case AS ( SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, ->) AS activity_sequence FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ORDER BY case_id, timestamp ) Wait, no. The STRING_AGG function in DuckDB can take an ORDER BY. So for each case_id, we can order the activities by timestamp and then aggregate them. So the correct way would be: SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity, -> ORDER BY timestamp) AS activity_sequence FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id Yes, that should work."

For example, using a CTE to get the counts, then select the top K."

So top 2 would be A->B->C and D->E. Then, the final query would return all events from cases 1, 2, 3. Yes. But what if K is 1? Then only the most frequent variant is selected. So the query seems correct."
