However, even without adjustment, it might have been approved based on P001. More critically: - U003 has a preliminary score of 695, which is lower than P002s 710 in Group A. P002 was rejected, but U003 was adjusted to 705 and approved. This suggests that even with a lower initial score, Group B members with the community group get a boost and get approved."

Since Group A is Protected and doesnt get the boost, while Group B does, this could be a form of bias against the protected group."

Lets look at the columns: In Group A, ScoreAdjustment is always 0 or N/A, while in Group B, its sometimes +10. So, Group Bs log explicitly shows the adjustment that causes the bias."

    "Text": "Final answer: The event log for Group B exhibits bias. This bias manifests in the ScoreAdjustment column, where members of Group B receive a +10 boost if they are part of a CommunityGroup, such as the Highland Civic Darts Club. This adjustment is not applied to Group A, as indicated by their LocalResident being FALSE and no CommunityGroup. As a result, Group B members may have higher final scores and are more likely to be approved even with lower preliminary scores, leading to systematic differences in final decisions that favor the Unprotected Group over the Protected Group."
