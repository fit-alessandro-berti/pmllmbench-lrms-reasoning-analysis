Order Received in Log A: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z - In Log B: 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z, OrderReceived - Difference: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z - 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z = 2 seconds - Thats exactly 2 seconds, but the requirement says less than 2 seconds, so maybe not a match? Wait, the prompt says e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, so Ill assume less than 2 seconds means strictly less. But to be precise, lets check: 2 seconds is not less than 2, its equal. However, for practical purposes, I might still consider it close. The prompt says a small timestamp tolerance for matching (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds), so Ill go with less than 2 seconds as the rule. Difference is 2 seconds, so not a match? That seems too strict. Actually, upon second thought, the example is less than 2 seconds, so Ill stick to that and not match if its exactly 2 or more. Wait, no: Lets calculate properly. From 09:59:58 to 10:00:00 is 2 seconds, which is not less than 2 seconds. So, perhaps dont match automatically. But they look like the same event. I need to use judgment. The prompt says Attempt to align based on order_id and event timing, so I can consider the event names as well. Event names: Order Received vs. OrderReceived – very similar. Ill match them because they are obviously the same."

Ill use the earliest timestamp or Log As for merged events. Let me decide on matches: - Match 1: Yes, because they are very close and names match. - Match 2: Yes. - For Payment: Even though 5s apart, the names are similar, and its the only possible match, so Ill match it. - Match 3: Yes for Item Shipped. - Leave Item Delivered as is from Log A. - Leave Quality Check as is from Log B."

Perhaps something like: timestamp (from Log A), event_type (combined name), order_id, and all other attributes from both. For example, for the first one: Timestamp: 2023-10-10T10:00:00Z (from Log A), Event: Order Received/OrderReceived, order_id: Order#1234, user_id: u45, resource_id: r10, notes: Event captured at warehouse system I need to document reasoning.
