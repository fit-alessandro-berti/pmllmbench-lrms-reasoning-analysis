    "Text": "Case 3: - Activities: Receive order, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order. - Violations: a) After Cancel order, we should not have Ship order. The description says: once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment such as packaging or shipping. b) Also, note that the case has both Authorize payment and then Cancel order. The normative process for insufficient inventory does not include payment authorization. It goes directly to cancellation. However, the description does not explicitly forbid authorizing payment in the insufficient inventory scenario? Lets check: The description says for insufficient inventory: after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to Cancel order. It does not mention payment authorization. Moreover, it says: payment authorization only makes sense once inventory sufficiency is known. In this case, they checked inventory and then authorized payment, but then canceled. This might be ambiguous. However, note the key constraints: Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging. In this case, after authorization they did not package but canceled. The description does not explicitly say that authorization must be followed by packaging, but it implies that authorization is part of the fulfillment path. Also, the cancellation path does not include authorization. Moreover, the description says: if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock ... the process must branch into a cancellation scenario. So if inventory is insufficient, we should cancel without authorization. Therefore, authorizing payment for an order that will be canceled is a violation because its unnecessary and not part of the intended flow. Additionally, shipping after cancellation is explicitly forbidden."
