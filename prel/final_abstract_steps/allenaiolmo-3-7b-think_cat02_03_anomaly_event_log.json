From what I remember, the typical flow is something like: Create Purchase Requisition Approve Purchase Requisition Issue Purchase Order Receive Goods Match Invoice to PO Release Payment Close Case. Thats the standard sequence, right?"

Because usually, the purchase requisition needs to be approved by someone before issuing the PO. So skipping the approval step here. Thats an anomaly."

Thats a huge problem."
