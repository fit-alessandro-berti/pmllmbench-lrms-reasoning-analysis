First, compute the sequences per case. 2. Then, for those sequences, count the frequencies. 3. Get the top K sequences by frequency. 4. Then, find all case_ids that have those top K sequences. 5.

It doesnt specify order, but probably good to order by case_id and timestamp. One issue: In top_k, Im selecting variant_sequence, but if there are ties, ROW_NUMBER would arbitrarily pick, but since Im using ORDER BY frequency DESC and LIMIT K, it will take the first K after ordering. That might not be perfect if there are ties, but I think its fine as per the prompt. The prompt says the top K variants by their frequency, so probably the first K after sorting."

One potential issue: If two activities have the same timestamp, the order might be arbitrary, but I think thats as per the data. STRING_AGG will concatenate them into a string, like A,B,C, which is fine for grouping. Assuming that the sequence is exactly that string. If activities have commas or special chars, it might mess up, but lets assume they dont. I could use ARRAY_AGG and then something, but STRING_AGG is straightforward. DuckDB has ARRAY_AGG, which might be better for exact matching. Yes, lets do that. So, in sequences CTE: SELECT case_id, ARRAY_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant_sequence FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id In variant_frequencies: SELECT variant_sequence, COUNT(*) AS frequency FROM sequences GROUP BY variant_sequence Yes.

The prompt is to write the query, and it should be a single query, which this is, using CTEs. About K: In the query, I need to specify K, like LIMIT 5, but since its a parameter, Ill assume its replaced, or in the answer, I can use a placeholder. I can write it as is. In the boxed answer, Ill write the query with LIMIT 5 or something, but better to keep it as K. To be precise, Ill write the query with LIMIT K, and assume its replaced.
