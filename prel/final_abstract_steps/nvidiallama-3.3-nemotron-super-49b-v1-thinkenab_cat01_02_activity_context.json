    "Text": "First, I need to look through each case and see which activities are repeated. Lets go case by case. Starting with C001. The activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, Approve Request. So Verify Documents happens twice here. Looking at the context: first time its Agent checks identity documents. Then after the customer submits additional docs, the second Verify is re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided. So the first Verify is initial check, the second is a recheck after missing docs were provided. In C002, activities are Initiate, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Call Customer again, Approve. So Call Customer is repeated. First context: clarify account discrepancy. Second: follow-up to confirm adjustments. So first call is to discuss an issue, second is to confirm changes. C003 has Initiate, Verify Docs, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Verify Docs again, Approve. Verify Documents twice. First is physical verification, second is re-verify after adjustment. Call Customer once here, but in C003s case, the call is because the customer stepped out and needed to return."

    "Text": "Now, need to rename these to reflect their context based on position and context. For Verify Documents: In C001: First occurrence is initial verification, second is after additional docs. In C002: Only one occurrence, but in C003, first is physical, second after adjustment. Wait, in C002, Verify Documents appears once. In C001 and C003, twice. So in C001 and C003, the two Verifies have different contexts. So perhaps in those cases, the first is Initial Document Verification and the second Re-verification of Documents. Similarly, Call Customer in C002 is used twice with different purposes. First to clarify discrepancy, second to confirm adjustments. So maybe Initial Clarification Call and Confirmation Call. In C003, the Call Customer is because the customer stepped out, so maybe Recall Customer for Process Continuation. Wait, but the task says to rename activities that appear multiple times within the SAME case. So for each case where an activity repeats, we need to differentiate those instances. Looking at C001s two Verify Documents: first is initial check, second is re-check after docs submitted. So rename first to Initial Document Verification and second to Document Re-verification. In C003s two Verify Documents: first is physical verification, second is after account adjustment. So first could be Physical Document Verification and second Post-Adjustment Document Re-check. For Call Customer in C002: first is to clarify account issue, second to confirm adjustments. So first Account Clarification Call, second Adjustment Confirmation Call. In C003s Call Customer: its because the customer left, so maybe Customer Recall Call."

    "Text": "Now, lets go through each case and adjust the names accordingly. C001: 1. Verify Documents Initial Document Verification 2. Verify Documents second Document Re-verification C002: 1. Call Customer first Account Clarification Call 2. Call Customer second Adjustment Confirmation Call C003: 1. Verify Documents first Physical Document Verification 2. Verify Documents second Post-Adjustment Re-verification 3. Call Customer Customer Recall Call Justification for each: For Verify Documents in C001, the first is initial, the second after additional docs. Context clues: checks identity documents vs. re-checks... after ID scan provided. In C003, first verify is physical branch context, second after adjustment. Call Customer in C002: first for clarification, second for confirmation. Context gives the purpose. In C003, the call is to recall the customer who stepped out. Other instances of Verify Documents or Call Customer that dont repeat in the same case keep their original name."

    "Text": "Now, lets construct the revised log. For C001: Original: C001 Verify Documents ... Agent checks... C001 Verify Documents ... Re-check... Renamed: C001 Initial Document Verification ... C001 Document Re-verification ... C002: Original: C002 Call Customer ... clarify... C002 Call Customer ... confirm... Renamed: C002 Account Clarification Call ... C002 Adjustment Confirmation Call ... C003: Original: C003 Verify Documents ... Physical... C003 Verify Documents ... Re-verify after... C003 Call Customer ... Customer stepped out... Renamed: C003 Physical Document Verification ... C003 Post-Adjustment Re-verification ... C003 Customer Recall Call ... Other activities remain the same. Now, check if any other activities might need renaming. For example, Adjust Account appears in C002 and C003, but not in the same case, so no. Submit Additional is unique. Approve Request is same everywhere."
