    "Text": "First, I need to understand the normative process. The strict rules require a specific sequence of activities. The sequence is: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] Close Case. Also, there are ordering rules: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. If approved, finalize before closing; if rejected, don't finalize before closing. Also, no skipping or reversing steps, and no finalizing after rejection."

The sequence is followed: Application Received, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. All steps are in order. Since it's approved, finalize before closing. So this case is compliant with all norms. No violations."

    "Text": "Case 2: Application Received at 2024-01-11 08:00. Then Risk Assessment at 08:20, but no Credit Check yet. That's a violation because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So this case has a violation here."

That's within 24 hours. Wait, but the desiderata says within a short time window after the application is received like 24 hours. Wait, maybe the 24 hours is a time window, so if the Credit Check is within 24 hours of application, then case 2's Credit Check is at 20 minutes after application, which is well within. But the user might have meant that the Credit Check must be done within 24 hours of application. But in case 2, the Credit Check is done at 08:20, which is 20 minutes after the application. So that's okay. But the user's note says that in case 2, the Risk Assessment is done at 09:00, but there's no Credit Check. Wait, the case 2's timeline is: ..."

Wait, but the desiderata says Credit Check completed within a short time window after the application is received (like 24 hours). So if the Credit Check is done 20 minutes after the application, that's within 24 hours. But the problem is that the case 2 has a Risk Assessment before the Credit Check, which is a normative violation. But the user's task is to identify which cases fail the desiderata.

So that's a normative violation. However, the desiderata is about the timing. But the desiderata says that the Credit Check should be completed within a short time window (like 24 hours). So if the Credit Check is done within 24 hours, then it's okay. But in case 2, the Credit Check is not done, so that's a violation of the desiderata. Wait, but the desiderata says that it's preferred that the Credit Check is done within a short time window, but not strictly required. So if the Credit Check is not done, that's a desideratum violation. But the user's event log for case 2 has the Risk Assessment done before the Credit Check, which is a normative violation. So case 2 has two violations: one normative (missing Credit Check) and another desideratum (missing Credit Check). But the user's question is to identify which cases fail the desiderata conditions.
