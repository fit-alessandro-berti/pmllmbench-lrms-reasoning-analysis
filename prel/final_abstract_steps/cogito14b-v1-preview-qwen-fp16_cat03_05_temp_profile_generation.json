Then RC would come next as the components arrive. After that, Quality Inspection (QI) is likely. Then Component Assembly (CA), followed by Testing (PT), Packaging (PK), Storage (WS), Distribution (DT), and finally AS."

    "Text": "I need to estimate average times for these steps. Let's think about typical durations in such a process. Supplier Selection might take days. Order Placement could be quick, hours or a day. Receiving components could vary depending on shipping time, so maybe a few days. Quality Inspection might take a day, Assembly another day, Testing perhaps a day, Packaging an hour, Storage variable but let's say a week before distribution, Distribution itself could take days, and After-Sales Support is ongoing."
