The strict sequence is: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] Close Case. The key constraints are the order of these steps, especially that Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and after Loan Decision, Inform Applicant has to happen. Also, if approved, finalize docs before closing; if rejected, dont finalize and close directly."

Then they do Credit Check later, but thats out of order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected), then they Finalize Documentation which is not allowed after rejection. So two violations here: incorrect order and finalizing after rejection."

Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant two days later (desideratum violation again, but not normative), then Finalize and Close. The sequence here seems okay: all steps in order, approved leads to finalize before close. So no normative violations here, just desiderata."
