If they pass, proceed.\n- Then the XOR branch: either CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck.

For example, if the data is incomplete, they request more info, then loop back to check again until it's complete.\n\nSo for the DataCompletenessCheck, perhaps a loop between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. Let me model that as a loop. Let's see:\n\nThe DataCompletenessCheck is an activity. If it finds missing info, it transitions to RequestMoreInfo, which then sends the request, and then loops back to DataCompletenessCheck again. So the loop would be between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the loop structure would be a loop node between those two."

    "Text": "Wait, the problem says that in the XOR choice, one path is the standard cultural fit, the other is the community affiliation path which gives a subjective uplift. So the CommunityAffiliationCheck is part of the XOR. So after the SkillAssessment, the process splits into two paths. One path does the standard cultural check, the other does the CommunityAffiliationCheck (which might adjust their scores). Then both paths proceed to the Managerial Review?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the CommunityAffiliationCheck is part of the cultural fit evaluation. The description says \"either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments.\" So the XOR is between the two different evaluation paths. The CommunityAffiliationCheck path gives them an advantage, so their evaluation is higher, making them more likely to pass to the next stage.\n\nTherefore, in the POWL model, after SkillAssessment, there's an XOR between the two paths. The CommunityAffiliationCheck path would then lead to the Managerial Review, same as the standard path. But the difference is that the CommunityAffiliationCheck gives a boost, so perhaps that activity modifies the candidate's score, but in terms of the workflow structure, the key is the branching itself allows that path to have an advantage."
