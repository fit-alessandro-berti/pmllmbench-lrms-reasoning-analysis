But the user wants a representative subset, so I dont have to list all possible combinations, just a good number of them, including some non-consecutive ones. Let me start by thinking about the typical order of activities. The process probably goes like: Supplier Selection -> Order Placement -> Receive Components -> Quality Inspection -> Component Assembly -> Product Testing -> Packaging -> Warehouse Storage -> Distribution -> After-Sales Support."

Let me think of possible time ranges: - Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP): Maybe a few days. Lets say average 3 days (259200 seconds). Stdev could be a day (86400) since some delays might happen. - OP to RC: Order placement to receiving. This could depend on supplier lead time. Lets say average 10 days (864000 seconds), stdev 2 days (172800). - RC to QI: Once received, inspection might take a day. So average 86400 sec, stdev 12 hours (43200)."

Lets say 3 days (259200), stdev 1 day (86400). DT to AS: After-sales support starts after distribution, but the time between them? Maybe AS is ongoing, but the time from DT to AS start could be immediate, but perhaps the support is ongoing. Hmm, maybe the temporal distance here is a bit tricky. Maybe better to skip that pair if uncertain, or consider that AS occurs after DT but the time could be minimal."

Lets compute the average as sum of their averages, but the stdev would be sqrt(sum of variances) but since we can just estimate, lets say: SS to QI: 3 (SS-OP) + 10 (OP-RC) +1 (RC-QI) days total 14 days (1,209,600 sec). So avg 1209600 (14*86400), stdev sqrt(86400^2 +172800^2 +43200^2) but maybe just assume 3 days stdev? Lets say 2,592,000 average? Wait, no, 14 days is 1,209,600 seconds.
