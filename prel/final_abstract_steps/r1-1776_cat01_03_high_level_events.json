    "Text": "Then theres applying a protective coating, drying it with another heating unit, and finally a visual check by an operator. The coating application and drying seem like finishing steps to protect the product. The visual check at the end is another quality check but done manually. So perhaps these are part of a Coating and Finishing step followed by a final Quality Assurance step."

So maybe Measure weld integrity is part of Assembly as an inline check before moving to the next step? Or is it part of a separate Quality Inspection phase?"

Assembly involves Operator B using a welding tool. Quality checks use Quality Sensor 1 and later Operator C for visual. Coating involves Coating Unit 3 and Heating Unit 2 for drying."

Then gap until 08:01:00 when Assembly starts 40 seconds later. Assembly from 08:01 to 08:01:10 10 seconds. Post-Assembly QC at 08:01:20 10 sec later."
