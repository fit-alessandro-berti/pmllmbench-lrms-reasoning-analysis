So, compared to the average of 20.4 hours, Case 101 and Case 103 are much faster, while Case 102, Case 104, and Case 105 are longer... Case 105 is significantly longer... Case 104 and Case 102 are similar... Case 105 is the most extreme."

So, cases above the median are Case 102, 104, and 105... Wait, actually... Case 104: 1450, Case 102: 1510, Case 105: 2945.

This could indicate a bottleneck in the Level-2 agent's availability or a queue for escalated tickets... Additionally, in Case 104, even without escalation, there is a long time between assigning to Level-1 Agent... and starting investigation... This suggests that even for Level-1 agents, there might be delays in starting the investigation, perhaps due to workload or other priorities."
