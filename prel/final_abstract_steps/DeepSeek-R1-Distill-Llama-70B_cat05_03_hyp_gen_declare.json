    "Text": "Looking at the example model The init rule says that the process starts with R Receive Claim which makes sense The existence rule requires that C Close Claim must happen which is also fine because every claim should eventually close The responded existence rule says that E Evaluate must happen after A Assign Adjuster That seems correct because you cant evaluate without assigning an adjuster first The precedence rule states that C Close must come after R Receive This seems redundant because Close should naturally come after Receive in the process so this might not be necessary and could cause issues The noncoexistence rule says that E cannot coexist with C Wait that doesnt make sense If E happens then C cannot happen That contradicts the process because after evaluation the claim should be approved notified and then closed So this rule is problematic"

    "Text": "So the main anomalies I see are 1 The noncoexistence rule between E and C is wrong It should allow C to happen after E not forbid it 2 The precedence rule for C after R is too broad because C should only come after specific steps not just R"
