High stdevs could indicate variability, but low stdev might mean automation or rigid scheduling without considering actual processing time. Then ('A', 'C'): 2h avg with 1h stdev. If a claim is closed 2 hours after assignment, but the process should go through Evaluate and Approve first, so this might indicate claims being closed too quickly without proper steps."
