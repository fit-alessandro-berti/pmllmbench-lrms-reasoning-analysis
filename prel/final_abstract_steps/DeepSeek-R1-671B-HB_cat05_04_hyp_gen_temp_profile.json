The database has three tables: claims, adjusters, and claim_events. The claim_events table tracks each activity in the claim handling process with timestamps. The temporal profile model shows average times and standard deviations between different activity pairs."

The example already points out four anomalies: R to P, P to N, A to C, and E to N. But maybe there's more to check. Wait, the user wants me to generate similar anomalies. Let me go through each activity pair in the model."

High stdevs could indicate variability, but low stdev might mean automation or rigid scheduling without considering actual processing time. Then ('A', 'C'): 2h avg with 1h stdev. If a claim is closed 2 hours after assignment, but the process should go through Evaluate and Approve first, so this might indicate claims being closed too quickly without proper steps."

('E', 'C'): 1h avg, 50min stdev. Not sure if that's an issue, but maybe if some claims close quickly and others take longer. ('P', 'N'): 7 days avg with 2 days stdev. That's a long time between approval and notification. Maybe a backlog, manual processes, or errors. ('N', 'C'): 30 minutes avg, 5min stdev. Seems okay."

So for R to P, look for claims where (time between R and P) is between avg ± 3*stdev and see if all are tightly clustered. Or check if they always take almost exactly 25 hours. Also, check if certain adjusters or claim types are involved in A-C anomalies. For P-N, see if there's a pattern in regions or adjusters causing delays. For E-N, check if it's always exactly 5 minutes, possibly automated. Also, see if there are claims that go from Assign to Close without Evaluate and Approve steps."

So after Evaluate should be Approve, then Notify. So if E to N is 5 minutes, maybe skipping the Approve step? That's a possibility. So check if claims go from E directly to N without P."
