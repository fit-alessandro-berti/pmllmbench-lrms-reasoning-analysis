    "Text": "Now, the constraints. Let's go through each one: - existence: Receive_Application and Gather_Additional_Documents must exist. So these activities are required. - absence: Proceed_Without_Compliance is forbidden. So that activity can't happen. - exactly_one: Preliminary_Credit_Check must occur exactly once. So it's a mandatory step. - init: Receive_Application is the initial step. So the process starts here. - responded_existence: Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package must exist and is responded by Quality_Assurance_Review. So after Assemble, Quality_Assurance must happen. - coexistence: Gather_Additional_Documents and Authorize_Contract_Terms must coexist. So both must occur together? - response: Receive_Application must be followed by Preliminary_Credit_Check. So after receiving the application, they do the credit check. - precedence: Quality_Assurance_Review must precede Authorize_Contract_Terms. So QA comes before authorization. - succession: Preliminary_Credit_Check must be followed by Gather_Additional_Documents. So after credit check, they gather more docs. - altresponse: Transfer_Funds is responded by Notify_Customer. So after transferring funds, notify customer. - altprecedence: Notify_Customer precedes Transfer_Funds. Wait, that's conflicting with altresponse? Because altresponse says Transfer_Funds is followed by Notify, but altprecedence says Notify comes before Transfer. Hmm, maybe there's a conflict here? Or maybe it's a different kind of relationship. Need to check. - altsuccession: Gather_Additional_Documents is followed by Quality_Assurance_Review. - chainresponse: Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package is followed by Transfer_Funds. - chainprecedence: Authorize_Contract_Terms precedes Preliminary_Credit_Check? Wait, that seems odd. Because earlier there's a succession that Preliminary_Credit_Check is followed by Gather_Documents. But chainprecedence says Authorize_Contract_Terms must precede Preliminary_Credit_Check. That might be a conflict. Maybe a typo? Or maybe it's a different relationship. Need to think. - chainsuccession: Quality_Assurance_Review is followed by Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package. - noncoexistence: Transfer_Funds and Receive_Application can't coexist. So they can't happen at the same time? Or maybe Transfer can't happen if Receive is done? Not sure. - nonsuccession: Notify_Customer can't be followed by Preliminary_Credit_Check. So after Notify, you can't go back to credit check. - nonchainsuccession: Authorize_Contract_Terms can't be followed by Notify_Customer. So after authorizing, you can't notify."
