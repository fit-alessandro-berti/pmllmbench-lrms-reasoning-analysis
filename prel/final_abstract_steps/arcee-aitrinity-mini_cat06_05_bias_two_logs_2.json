Wait, in Group A, the LocalResident field is False for all cases, meaning theyre not local. Group B has LocalResident as True, so theyre local. The main point is Group Bs applications have a +5 Association Boost in CulturalFitCheck. This boost happens for candidates in the LocalBusinessLeadersClub professional association."
