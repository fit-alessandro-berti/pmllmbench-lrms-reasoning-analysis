    "Text": "For ManualReview: coexistence with FinalDecision implies if FinalDecision occurs, ManualReview must occur. Since FinalDecision has an existence constraint, ManualReview will also effectively be required in every trace. So, adding existence for ManualReview would be consistent.\nFor BiasMitigationCheck: precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision) means FinalDecision can only occur if BiasMitigationCheck has occurred. Since FinalDecision must exist, BiasMitigationCheck must also exist. So, add existence for BiasMitigationCheck.\nFor CheckSensitiveAttribute: Its part of nonsuccession. This activity might not occur in every trace (e.g., if sensitive attributes are not always checked or relevant). So, existence for CheckSensitiveAttribute is not strictly necessary unless we want to enforce it always happens. Lets assume its optional."
