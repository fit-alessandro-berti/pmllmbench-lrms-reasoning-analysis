DataCompletenessCheck: An automated system checks if the resume is complete. If not, the applicant is asked to provide more information via RequestMoreInfo. 3. SkillAssessment: Applicants take an online test. Those below a certain score are disqualified. 4. CulturalFitCheck or CommunityAffiliationCheck: This is where the bias creeps in. If the applicant has local affiliations, they get a slight advantage. 5. ManagerialReview: Borderline candidates are reviewed by a hiring manager. 6.

So, the main structure is a partial order where A is first, then the loop (B and C), then D, then the XOR (E and F), then G, then H. ... Wait, but in POWL, the XOR operator is a choice between its children. So, after D, the XOR is applied, choosing either E or F. Each of these is followed by G and H. ... Wait, perhaps I need to structure it as: After D, the XOR is applied, which branches into E or F. Each of these branches then goes to G, then H. ... Alternatively, perhaps it's simpler to have the XOR node followed by G and H in sequence, since both E and F lead to G and H. ... I think the correct approach is to model the XOR node as a choice between E and F, and then after the XOR, G and H are executed. So, the order is D XOR G H. Thus, the XOR node's children are E and F, and after the XOR, G and H are added to the partial order."

Since the XOR is followed by G and H, it means that regardless of whether E or F is chosen, the process proceeds to G and H. This correctly models the process where both paths lead to managerial review and final decision. In the second model, the path is straightforward without any branching after the skill assessment, ensuring fairness. I think this should be the correct approach."
