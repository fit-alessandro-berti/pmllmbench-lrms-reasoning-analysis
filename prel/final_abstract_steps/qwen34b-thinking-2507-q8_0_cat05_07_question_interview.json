For example, when they talk about assigning property managers, theres no mention of how they actually choose between candidates. How do they weigh the factors like workload versus specialization?"

    "Text": "Also, the questions should build on the interviewees own words. Since they described the process, I can reference their phrases to show Im listening.

Timeline for key steps (like how long after docs are verified before marketing starts) 4. Who owns the decision when theres a conflict between landlord and manager 5. How exceptions like special insurance are integrated into the process 6. What triggers a re-evaluation of the propertys pricing 7. How communication gaps are handled when stakeholders disagree 8. How they track and document the entire process for audits"
