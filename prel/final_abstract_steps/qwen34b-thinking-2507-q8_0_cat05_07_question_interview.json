    "Text": "Okay, the user wants me to create a list of targeted questions for an interviewee who described their property onboarding process. They've given me a detailed long process description of how a large property management company handles new rental properties. First, I need to understand what the user really needs. They're probably someone doing research, maybe a consultant, analyst, or someone building a system that mimics this process. Their goal is to ask questions that will clarify the process without getting into technical stuff like SQL. The key is to focus on conceptual understanding - missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, exceptions."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at the process description they provided, it's quite thorough but has some areas where I can dig deeper. For example, when they talk about assigning property managers, there's no mention of how they actually choose between candidates. How do they weigh the factors like workload versus specialization? I should think about the natural gaps in the description. The process mentions multiple decision points but doesn't specify what those decisions look like in practice. Like, when the inspector finds issues, who decides how serious they are? Is it the manager or the compliance team?"

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Let me brainstorm some categories of questions: - Decision criteria (how they pick managers, when to escalate issues) - Roles and responsibilities (who does what when things go wrong) - Timing and sequencing (how long each step takes, dependencies) - Exception handling (what happens with special cases) - Communication flow (how they track everything, what tools they use)"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For each category, I'll think of specific questions. Like for decision criteria: When assigning a property manager, how do you weigh the manager's current workload against their geographic specialization? That's good because it gets into the actual decision factors. I should avoid questions that might lead to technical answers. The user said no SQL or implementation details. So no questions about databases or specific tools beyond what's mentioned (like CRMs)."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I need to make sure all questions are open-ended. No yes/no questions. They should start with Can you tell me... or How do you typically... to get detailed responses. I should also build on the interviewee's own words. Since they described the process, I can reference their phrases to show I'm listening. Like You mentioned that the property manager schedules a photographer and inspector - how does the timeline for this inspection typically work? I should phrase them carefully to be open-ended. Instead of Do you have a timeline for inspections? it's better as How do you typically determine the timeline for the inspection phase?"

I'll make sure each question targets one specific gap in the description and stays conceptual. No jargon, no technical asks. Just pure process understanding."
