    "Text": "Starting with the first part identifying anomalies The loop structure for E and P allows looping between evaluation and approval That might mean a claim is evaluated approved then evaluated again which could be a problem if its supposed to be a one time process Also the XOR that allows skipping N notify customer could lead to claims being closed without notifying the customer which is a big issue in customer service"

    "Text": "Now moving to the second part why these anomalies exist Maybe the loop was added to handle re evaluations if an approval is denied but its not properly structured The XOR might have been a temporary fix if the system couldnt handle mandatory notifications The partial order could be a result of a design oversight where the correct sequence wasnt enforced perhaps due to a technical error in the workflow tool"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait but how do I structure these queries Lets think The claim events table has the activity and timestamp So for each claim we can look at the sequence of events For example to find claims closed without approval we can check if the last event is C but theres no P before it Similarly for the loop check if E and P events are in a loop maybe multiple Es followed by Ps But maybe just multiple Ps for the same claim would indicate a loop"
