A low standard deviation here suggests that the time between Receive and Approve is consistently around that average, which might not make sense."

A high STDEV means there's a lot of variability, but the average is extremely long. That could mean that sometimes it takes way longer than usual, maybe due to delays in notification systems, or maybe some claims are stuck in a pending state for a long time."
