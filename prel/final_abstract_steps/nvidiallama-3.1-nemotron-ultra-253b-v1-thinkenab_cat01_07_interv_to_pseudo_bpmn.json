    "Text": "Also Ritas role comes in when exceptions occur at any point Karens role is when AP or Purchasing involve her to contact suppliers Wait Karen says shes looped in when AP or Purchasing finds issues This is a point of ambiguity This is a bit conflicting To resolve this the model should note that in some cases the Purchasing Officer may contact the supplier directly while in others the Supplier Relationship Manager is involved But since the model must be clear perhaps we can assign the task to the role mentioned in the interviews Alternatively if the task is performed by different roles This might complicate the model but the guidance says to note uncertainties where necessary So in the model for tasks like contacting the supplier we can indicate that the role is either Purchasing Officer or Supplier Relationship Manager But given that the Supplier Relationship Managers role is specifically to handle supplier communications perhaps those tasks are assigned to her Alternatively based on the interviews So for example But the model needs to capture these distinctions However to keep the model concise its better to assign tasks to the primary role responsible as per the interviews"
