    "Text": "First, I need to figure out how to count the number of events per case_id. That sounds like a GROUP BY operation. So maybe I can use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to get the counts. Like, first calculate the count for each case_id, then filter those with count <=6, and then get the events for those case_ids."
