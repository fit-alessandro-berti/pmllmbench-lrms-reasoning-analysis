    "Text": "Derive activities from the tables: - From Orders: \"Order Created\" event. - From Order Lines: \"Items Picked\" events. Since there might be multiple items per order, I need to decide how to handle that. The prompt says to produce one event per activity if meaningful. For an order, the picking of items could be one event per order, but since each item has its own picking date and picker, I might need to create separate events. However, to keep it simple and aligned with process mining, I'll create one \"Items Picked\" event per order, using the earliest picking date or something similar. The prompt suggests: \"produce one event per activity if it is meaningful\". For process mining, we typically have events per case, so per order, one \"Items Picked\" event might suffice, but I should check. Looking back: \"Items Picked\" event(s) from the Order Lines table. It says event(s), so perhaps one per line, but that might clutter the log. The instruction is: \"When multiple timestamps are available, produce one event per activity if it is meaningful, or summarize if appropriate.\" For an order, the activity is picking items for that order, so I'll summarize to one event per order for \"Items Picked\", using the earliest picking date for that order. - From Delivery: \"Order Dispatched\" and \"Order Arrived\" events. An order can have multiple deliveries, so for each delivery record per order, I might need separate events, like \"Order Dispatched for DLV-XXXX\" and \"Order Arrived for DLV-XXXX\". But to keep it at the order level, perhaps one dispatched and one arrived per order, using the relevant dates. The table has multiple deliveries for some orders (e.g., order 1002 has two). I need to include events for each, but ensure they are in sequence. - From Invoice: \"Invoice Issued\" event. An order can have multiple invoices, so one event per invoice per order. - From Payments: \"Payment Received\" event. Since invoices can have multiple payments, one event per payment."
