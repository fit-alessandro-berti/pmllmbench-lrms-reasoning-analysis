    "Text": "First, I should start by looking at all the events and note the changes in the sensor data. Let me list out all the events again in my mind: Event 1-3: The first three events are all at low temperature (around 20Â°C), pressure 1 bar, zero vibration, material flow and tool position also at zero, energy use fluctuating a bit between 0.4 and 0.5 kWh. These look like idle or startup phases maybe, since the readings are flat and low."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "From event 4 to 6: Temperature goes up to 58, vibration up to 38, pressure 1.5, tool position to 10mm. These could be some kind of operation that's active. Maybe cutting or drilling? Since vibration and tool movement. Since material flow is constant at 5, but then in event 7, the temp drops to 40, vibration down to 10, flow reduces to 2, tool at 15mm."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So events 4-6: Higher temp and vibration, material flowing, and tool positioning indicate processing. Afterward, events 7-8 show lower vibration but maintaining a tool position at 15mm and reduced flow. This pattern fits a transition phase, likely assembling or aligning parts for welding."

    "Text": "Event 9 has a big jump again: temperature 80, vibration 50, pressure 2 bar, but material flow is zero now. That's interesting. Energy spikes to 5kWh. That might be something high-energy and high-heat, perhaps welding? Since welding usually requires high temperature and maybe vibrations during the process?"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Event 10 drops all those high readings back down: temp 30, vibration 1, pressure 1, but tool stays at 15? Maybe post-welding? Then events 11-12 have temp 25, slight vibration up to 5, a bit of material flow 1, tool moves to 20mm. Energy around 1.5. Could that be packaging or moving the part out of the machine?"

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at the entire structure, the phases follow logically: Idle/Startup at 1-3, cutting/machining from 4-6 with high energy and operational readings, followed by positioning (7-8), welding at event 9 with clear spikes, a cooling phase (10), and finishing with packaging/inspection at 11-12 before returning to idle at 13-15."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Energy and tool position changes are good proxies for identifying key activities. Higher energy and movement in 4-6 suggest cutting, while the large spike in event 9 combined with high vibrations strongly indicates welding. The tool position increase in 11-12 aligns with packaging logic."
