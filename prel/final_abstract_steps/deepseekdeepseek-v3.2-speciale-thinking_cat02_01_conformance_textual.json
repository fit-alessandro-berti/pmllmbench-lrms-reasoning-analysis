Lets break down the rules: - Process always begins with Receive order. - After Receive, next is Check inventory (must occur before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment). So Check inventory must be ... before any other activity. However, the timestamp order is given; we can see if any case has something between Receive and Check? No; all cases have Receive then Check next in sequence. So thats fine."
