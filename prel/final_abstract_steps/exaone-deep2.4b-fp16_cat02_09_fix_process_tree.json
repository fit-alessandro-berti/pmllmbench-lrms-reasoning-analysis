    "Text": "According to the steps specified in the domain logic, certain steps (3–7) must be completed in a strict order. For example, creating a purchase order (step 3) must precede receiving goods (step 4), and matching an invoice (step 6) must precede paying it (step 7). These relationships imply that a sequence is required."

This confirms the need for a sequence."
