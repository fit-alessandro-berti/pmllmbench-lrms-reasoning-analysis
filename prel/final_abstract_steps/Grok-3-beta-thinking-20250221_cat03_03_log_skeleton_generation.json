Wait, perhaps a better way to think about it is that for each order, there is one RO and one D, so in a trace representing one order, RO occurs once and D occurs once. ... But the equivalence constraint is between two specific activities... In this case, since all mandatory activities occur once per trace, then any two mandatory activities would satisfy that they both occur once. ...
