If someone is equally qualified but not part of a favored community or isnt a local resident, they might not get approved for a loan or whatever this system is handling.

But C005, without community, still got approved with a higher score. So maybe the issue isnt just community but also the initial score. C003 had 715, which is lower than C005s 740. But why was C003 rejected while C005 was approved? Maybe the initial score plays a bigger role, but the community adjustment might have helped others push their scores up."
