Understand the Goal: The user wants me to analyze a provided event log of a support workflow, identify recurring activities within the same case that have different meanings based on context, rename them to be more descriptive, present the revised log, and justify the naming choices. 2. Analyze the Event Log: Case C001: Initiate Request Start, Verify Documents First check incomplete, Call Customer Request missing docs, Submit Additional Customer action, Verify Documents Second check after submission recurrence, Approve Request End. Case C002: ... Call Customer recurrence. Case C003: Verify Documents recurrence."
