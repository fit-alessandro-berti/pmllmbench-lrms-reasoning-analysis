In process mining, underfitting typically refers to a model that is too general and doesn't capture the specific constraints of the process. So, in this case, the current model allows activities to happen in ways that shouldn't be possible according to the actual process."

    "Text": "Looking at the current model: - It starts with 'Create Purchase Requisition' and then 'Approve Purchase Requisition.' So far, so good. - After that, there's a parallel block (AND operator) containing 'Create Purchase Order,' 'Receive Goods,' 'Receive Invoice,' 'Match Invoice to PO,' and 'Pay Invoice.' - Finally, 'Close Case' is performed after the parallel block. The issue here is that the parallel block allows all these activities to happen in any order, which is not correct for a procure-to-pay process."

Receive Invoice 6. Match Invoice to PO 7. Pay Invoice 8. Close Case. The current model is too permissive because it allows activities like 'Receive Invoice' or 'Pay Invoice' to happen before 'Receive Goods,' which might not be desirable or even possible in the real process."

    "Text": "Let me think about how to structure this. First, the sequence starts with 'Create Purchase Requisition' and 'Approve Purchase Requisition.' That part seems fine as it is, since it's a sequence. After approving the requisition, the next step is to 'Create Purchase Order.' Then, 'Receive Goods' should happen after the purchase order is created. After receiving the goods, we can receive the invoice. Once the invoice is received, we need to match it to the PO. After matching, we can pay the invoice, and finally close the case."

For example, perhaps 'Receive Goods' and 'Receive Invoice' can happen in any order, as long as they both happen after 'Create Purchase Order.'

Well, sometimes invoices are sent before the goods are delivered, especially in cases where payment is due upon invoice issuance. Similarly, goods might be received before the invoice is sent by the supplier. So, to cover both possibilities, having 'Receive Goods' and 'Receive Invoice' in a parallel block makes sense, as they can occur in any order but need to be completed before matching the invoice to the PO."
