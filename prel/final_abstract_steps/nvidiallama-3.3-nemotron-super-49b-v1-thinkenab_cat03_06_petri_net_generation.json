Since Petri nets don't have conditional statements, maybe AP is a transition that's sometimes executed. But how? Maybe after CA, there's a choice: if approval is needed, go through AP, else skip. But without guards, perhaps the Petri net allows both paths. Wait, but the problem says \"must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold.\" So in the model, CA leads to AP only when needed, but since Petri nets model possible behaviors, maybe the AP transition is optional. However, the model should include AP as a possible step. But how to enforce that AP is only taken when required? That's tricky. Maybe the problem allows AP to be part of the model, but the actual logic (the condition) can't be modeled here. So perhaps the Petri net includes AP as a transition that can be fired after CA, but the firing depends on the condition. Since we can't model conditions in the net structure, maybe we just include AP as a possible step that is part of the path when needed."

    "Text": "So perhaps the correct approach is to model AP as an optional step. But how?\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects that the approval is part of the process, but the model includes it as a transition that can be fired when needed. So after CA, there's a transition to AP, and after AP, to P. Also, a direct transition from CA to P. But that would allow both paths, which may not be correct. However, given the constraints of Petri nets, this might be the way to model it.\n\nBut the problem says \"the claim must be approved if the amount surpasses a threshold.\" So in the model, the path through AP is required in those cases. But since the model can't enforce that, perhaps the problem expects that AP is part of the mandatory flow. Wait, maybe the problem's description implies that approval is always required. Let me check the scenario again.\n\nThe scenario says: \"Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold.\" So AP is conditional. Therefore, the model should allow the process to proceed from CA to P directly if no approval is needed, but must go through AP if needed. However, since Petri nets can't model conditions, the model will have both paths. The final marking is achieved when the process reaches CL, regardless of the path taken."
