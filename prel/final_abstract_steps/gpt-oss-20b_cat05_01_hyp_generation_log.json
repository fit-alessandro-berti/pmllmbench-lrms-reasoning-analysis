For each anomaly, hypothesize possible causes (system errors, policy violations, etc.). 3. Suggest specific SQL queries you would run on `order_event_log` (and optionally `orders`, `resources`) to investigate each hypothesis. Make sure no extra explanation beyond that. Ok produce final answer accordingly."
