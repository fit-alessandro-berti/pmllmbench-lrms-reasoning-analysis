The user wants me to identify anomalies in the order event logs hypothesize why they might happen and then propose SQL queries to investigate further. First Ill go through each case to spot inconsistencies. Starting with case_id 1001 The event log shows all steps from Register Order to Receive Payment in order. The timestamps seem sequential 0815 to 0830 to 0900 etc. That looks normal."

Also Confirm Shipment is recorded after Receive Payment which doesnt make sense since shipment should happen before payment."

Case 1003s reversed steps Could be a mislabeled event eg Ship Goods was logged when confirmation happened or a process error in the system. Case 1004s payment before invoice This is a serious compliance issue payment shouldnt be processed until invoice is issued. Might be due to a cash handling error or misconfigured system."
