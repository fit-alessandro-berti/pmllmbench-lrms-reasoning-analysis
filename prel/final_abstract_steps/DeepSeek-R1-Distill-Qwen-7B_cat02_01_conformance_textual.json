Thats a violation because Authorize should only happen after Package. So this case is deviating."

Wait, no, the timestamps are: 9:00: Receive 9:20: Check 9:40:Authorize 9:40: Cancel? No, the Cancel is at 9:40, but according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, it should Cancel without Authorizing. So in this case, after Authorize, it cancels, which is a violation because you shouldnt Authorize before Canceling if inventory is insufficient. Wait, actually, the order in the log is: After Check, Authorize, then Cancel. But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, it should Cancel, and then Close. So in this case, its Authorizing before Canceling, which is incorrect."

Case 4 followed the correct insufficient inventory path. Case 1 and 5 followed the correct sufficient inventory path."

    "Text": "I think thats all. Let me double check the timestamps for any other possible violations. Looking again at Case 3: After Check, the activities are Authorize, Cancel, Close. But according to the normative process, if inventory is insufficient, after Check, you should Cancel and then Close, without Authorizing. So having Authorize before Cancel is wrong. Similarly, in Case 2, after Check, it went to Package, then Authorize, which is wrong because Authorize should come after Package. So yes, these two cases are the ones violating the normative process."
