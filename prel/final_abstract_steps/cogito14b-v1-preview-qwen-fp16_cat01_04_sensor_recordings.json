    "Text": "Looking at the events, each row represents a timestamp with various sensor readings for Machine M1. The key sensors here are temperature, pressure, vibration level, material flow rate, tool position, and energy consumption. My goal is to group these into meaningful phases or activities based on how these values change over time."

    "Text": "Starting with Event 1-3: Temperature starts at 20C and slightly increases to 21C. Pressure remains low (1 bar), vibration is zero, no material flow, tool position is zero, and energy usage is minimal. This seems like an idle or startup phase since everythings stable except for a minor temperature increase."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then Events 4-6 show significant changes: Temperature spikes from 50 to 58C, pressure increases slightly to 1.5 bar, vibration rises sharply (30Hz to 38Hz), material flow starts at 5 units/s and remains steady, tool position jumps to 5mm then 7mm, and energy consumption triples. This sudden rise in temperature and vibration suggests an operation that generates a lot of heat and mechanical stressmaybe cutting or welding."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 7-8: Temperature drops from 58 to 40C but stays there, pressure remains at 2 bar, vibration decreases slightly (10Hz), material flow is low (2 units/s), tool position is fixed at 15mm, energy usage stabilizes. This could indicate an assembly phase where parts are aligned and held in place with moderate stress."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Events 9: Temperature shoots up to 80C again, pressure increases further, vibration spikes, but no material flow. Tool position stays high. Energy jumps even more. This might be a welding operation that uses high heat and energy."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 10-15: A gradual cooldown to normal levels (20-30C), pressure returns to baseline, low vibration, minimal flow, tool resets, energy drops. This looks like the end phase or shutdown where everything is returning to idle state."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "So grouping these events into phases: 1. Idle/Startup 2. Cutting/Welding 3. Assembly 4. Welding (again) 5. End/Shutdown The rationale for each label comes from observing how the sensor values change during each event cluster, linking them to typical manufacturing processes."
