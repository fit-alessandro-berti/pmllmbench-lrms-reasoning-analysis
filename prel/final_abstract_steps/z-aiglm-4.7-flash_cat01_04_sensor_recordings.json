    "Text": "2. Analyze the Event Log: Lets look at the data row by row. Events 1-3: Time: 08:00:00 to 08:00:15 (Duration: 15s) Temp: 20C -> 21C (Stable) Pressure: 1 bar (Stable) Vibration: 0 Hz (Stable - likely idle/startup) Flow: 0 units/s Position: 0 mm Energy: 0.40 - 0.50 kWh (Low) Observation: The machine is sitting at position 0, idle. Its waiting or initializing. Events 4-6: Time: 08:00:15 to 08:00:30 (Duration: 15s) Temp: 50 -> 58C (Rapid increase - heating up) Pressure: 1 -> 1.5 bar (Slight increase) Vibration: 30 -> 38 Hz (Significant increase - machine turning on/initializing heavy load) Flow: 5 units/s (Starting) Position: 5 -> 10 mm (Moving) Energy: 2.00 -> 3.00 kWh (Significant increase) Observation: This looks like the machine is warming up and starting the actual process. The pressure/vibration rise is characteristic of a cutting or drilling mechanism engaging. Events 7-8: ... Observation: ... Events 9: ... Observation: ... Events 10-12: ... Observation: ... Events 13-15: ... Observation: Idle again."

    "Text": "3. Synthesize Phases: Phase A: Idle / Setup (Events 1-3) Low energy, no movement, low temp. Phase B: Machine Startup / Pre-Processing (Events 4-6) Rising Temp, rising Vibration, rising Energy. The tool starts moving (Position change). Phase C: Active Operation / Cutting (Events 7-8) ... Phase D: High Intensity / Adjustment or Welding (Event 9) ... Correction: Looking at the prompts suggested examples (Cutting, Assembling, Welding). Event 9 is the most unique. High temp, high vibration, zero flow. This matches Welding / Heating well. Phase E: Cooling / Stabilization (Events 10-12) ... Phase F: Idle (Events 13-15) ... Refining the grouping: The prompt asks to group events into activities. Group 1 (1-3): System Idle / Initialization. Group 2 (4-8): ... 4-6: Machine Startup / Tooling Preparation (Ramping up). 7-8: Active Machining / Cutting (Stable operation). Group 3 (9): Welding / Heat Application ... Group 4 (10-12): Cooling & Retracting ... Group 5 (13-15): Finish / Reset."

    "Text": "4. Drafting the Labels and Rationale: Activity 1: Idle / Standby (Events 1-3) Sensors: Temp ~20C, Vibration 0, Flow 0, Position 0. Energy ~0.5kWh. Logic: No mechanical activity, standard ambient temperature. Activity 2: Startup & Pre-processing (Events 4-6) Sensors: Temp 50->58C, Vibration 30->38Hz, Energy 2->3kWh. Logic: Rapid increase in energy and vibration indicates the motor/actuators engaging. This is the warm-up phase. Activity 3: Active Machining / Cutting (Events 7-8) Sensors: Temp drops to 40C, Pressure 2 bar, Vibration 10Hz. Position 15mm. Logic: This phase represents the actual production work. ... Alternative interpretation: Event 7 is the cutting. ... Activity 4: Welding / Heat Treatment (Event 9) Sensors: Temp 80C (Peak), Vibration 50Hz (Peak), Flow 0. Logic: The lack of material flow and the spike in heat/vibration strongly suggests a localized heat application, typically welding ... Activity 5: Cooling & Retraction (Events 10-12) ... Activity 6: Completion / Idle (Events 13-15) ..."

    "Text": "Refining the grouping for the user: Since the log is small, grouping it into 4 distinct major phases makes sense. 1. Idle 2. Startup (Ramping up) 3. Operation (Stable state - Assembly/Cutting) 4. Welding (The spike) 5. Cooling (Dropping) 6. Reset Lets condense it into 4-5 main labeled steps for clarity. Self-Correction on Labels: The prompt asks for intuitive labels like Cutting Metal, Assembling. Group 4-6: Equipment Warm-up / Preparation Group 7-8: Active Machining (Lets call this Cutting/Processing based on the pressure/flow). Note: Temp drops, which is weird for cutting (usually temp rises). ... Group 9: This is the most distinct. Welding. Group 10-12: Cooling Down."

    "Text": "Phase 1: System Initialization (Events 1-3) Reason: Low energy, no vibration, standard temp. Phase 2: Machine Setup & Ramping (Events 4-6) Reason: Sudden spike in energy, temp, vibration. Tool starts moving. Phase 3: Active Production (Events 7-8) Reason: Stabilized pressure and vibration. Tool position fixed. Phase 4: High-Intensity Operation (Event 9) Reason: Extreme heat (80C) and vibration without material flow. This corresponds to Welding. Phase 5: Cooling & Stabilization (Events 10-12) Reason: Rapid temperature drop, vibration returning to baseline. Phase 6: Cycle Reset (Events 13-15) Reason: Machine returns to idle state."

    "Text": "6. Final Review of Rationales: Event 1-3: Idle (Energy 0.5kWh, Vibration 0). Event 4-6: Transition/Startup (Energy 2-3kWh, Temp 50+). High vibration/pressure indicates engagement. Event 7-8: Operational (Pressure 2bar, Position 15). Stable. Event 9: High Energy/Heat spike (Temp 80). No flow -> Welding. Event 10-12: Cool down (Temp drops to 25). Event 13-15: Idle. I will group them into logical Activities. Activity 1: System Standby. Activity 2: Active Manufacturing (Processing). Activity 3: Welding / Heat Treatment. Activity 4: Part Cooling. Activity 5: Reset. Lets write it out."
