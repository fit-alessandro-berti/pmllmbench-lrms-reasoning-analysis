The user mentioned that a case could be something like editing a document, handling an email, or reviewing a PDF. So I need to identify which events belong to the same case."

But then, when they switch back, how does that fit? Alternatively, maybe the case is the overall task, like Preparing Quarterly Report, which involves multiple documents."

But the problem is that the user might be working on multiple cases in parallel, but process mining typically deals with sequential cases. Alternatively, maybe the case is the entire session, but thats not useful for process mining."

So: Case 1: Document1.docx (events 2-5) – FOCUS, TYPING, TYPING, SAVE Then, SWITCH to Chrome (event 6), so Case 1 ends. Case 2: Email - Inbox (events 6-11) – SWITCH, CLICK, SCROLL, CLICK, TYPING, CLICK Then, SWITCH to Acrobat (event 12), Case 2 ends. Case 3: Report_Draft.pdf (events 12-14) – SWITCH, SCROLL, HIGHLIGHT"
