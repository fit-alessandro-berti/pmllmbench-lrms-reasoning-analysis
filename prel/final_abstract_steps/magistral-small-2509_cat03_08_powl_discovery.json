In case 2 LB is skipped. In case 3 there are multiple IQC and RT steps. In case 4 theres no IQC or RT it goes OR MS QS AS TST PK LB DP D. In case 5 there are multiple RT steps. So the process seems to start with OR then MS QS and AS. Then theres a loop involving IQC and AS. After some iterations it moves to TST. If the test fails RT is done leading back to TST. Then PK and optionally LB then DP then D."
