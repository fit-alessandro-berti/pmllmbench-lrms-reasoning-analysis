    "Text": "Okay, lets tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process description thoroughly. The process starts with Receive order, followed by Check inventory. Depending on inventory sufficiency, the process branches into two paths: one for sufficient inventory and another for insufficient. For sufficient inventory, the sequence should be: Receive Check Authorize Payment Package Ship Close. If inventory is insufficient, the path is: Receive Check Cancel Close. Key constraints are that payment authorization must come after checking inventory, packaging after authorization, shipping after packaging, and closing at the end. Also, after cancellation, there should be no shipping or fulfillment activities."
