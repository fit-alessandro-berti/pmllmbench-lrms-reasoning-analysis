    "Text": "Now, to confirm, let's check that the sequences make sense for each case. For Case 1 (age 45, M): - Register -> Triage -> X-ray -> Consultation -> Discharge This is typical for an ER visit where X-ray is needed for a fracture. For Case 2 (age 62, F): - Register -> Triage -> Lab request -> Lab results -> Consultation -> Prescription -> Discharge This makes sense for a minor infection that requires lab tests and medication. For Case 3 (age 28, M): - Register -> Consultation -> Prep -> Surgery -> Recovery -> Discharge This is a clear surgical pathway, which is logical for a scheduled knee surgery. The timestamps also align logically, with events for each patient happening in a sequence without overlapping in a way that would suggest mixing cases."
