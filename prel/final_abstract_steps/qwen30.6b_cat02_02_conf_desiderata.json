Wait, case 2s loan is rejected, so they shouldnt finalize before closing. But in the log, they do finalize, which is allowed. Wait, no. The problem says if loan is rejected, do not finalize documentation before closing. So if the case is rejected, you shouldnt finish the documentation before closing. But in case 2, the loan is rejected, and they do finalize documentation after closing. Thats a violation."
