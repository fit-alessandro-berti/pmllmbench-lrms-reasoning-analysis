After that, theres a loop containing Approve_Order (A) and Issue_Invoice (I). Finally, there are transitions to Receive_Payment (P) and Close_Order (O)."

    "Text": "The loop around A and I is another issue. Normally, you approve an order once and then issue the invoice. Repeating these steps in a loop doesnt make sense unless theres some iterative approval process, which isnt typical. This could indicate inefficiency or confusion in the workflowmaybe employees are looping through approvals unnecessarily."

    "Text": "These anomalies matter because skipping credit checks leads to financial risks like uncollectible debts. The loop might cause delays and redundant work, reducing efficiency and possibly leading to incorrect invoicing if not managed properly. Both issues highlight process noncompliance with standard practices."
