So the loops structure is such that after the RDT, the process can choose to exit (if normal) or loop again (if abnormal. Since thats a condition, but since process trees cant model that, perhaps the loop must be structured such that the decision to exit or continue is part of the loop operators choice. Wait, the loop operator * (A,B) works as follows: - First, execute A. - Then, choose between exiting the loop, or executing B followed by A again. Thus, the B must be the path that must be taken to repeat the loop.
