We have described a process: Customer files Insurance Claim (C), then following steps: 1. Claim Registration (CR): The claim is logged into the system. 2. Document Verification (DV): Customer's documents are verified. 3. Fraud Check (FC): The claim is examined by a special unit to ensure there\u2019s no fraudulent activity. 4. Claim Assessment (CA): The claim is assessed by an adjuster who decides compensation amount. 5. Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by senior manager if the amount surpasses threshold. 6. Payment (P): Approved claim is paid out to customer. 7. Notification (N): The customer is notified about the resolution and payment details. 8. Closure (CL): Claim is closed and archived."

But wait, how do we incorporate re-submission loop? The text says In some cases, if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (Re-Document Submission (RDS)) before the process continues. So the flow: DV -> possibly RDS. And then from RDS, presumably back to DV or directly to FC?

But that would be a loop on FC: after II, token goes back to p_fc. And if fraud check is clear, then go forward to CA.

But note that in a Petri net with no inhibitor arc, if there is token in p_dv, both T_RDS and T_FC will be enabled simultaneously. This means that in an actual run, they could compete.
