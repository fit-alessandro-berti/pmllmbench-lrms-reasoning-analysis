    "Text": "Mary says that when an invoice arrives she checks if its associated with a valid purchase order number If it doesnt have a PO I send it back to the supplier requesting more details If it has a PO I log it into our accounting system After logging it I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received Once I get confirmation I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system If everything matches I then send it to the department manager for approval If theres a discrepancy like incorrect pricing or missing items I email the purchasing team to clarify Sometimes if the discrepancy cant be resolved easily I have to escalate it to my supervisor Once all issues are resolved and the manager approves I schedule it for payment Thats basically the flow"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the initial steps are 1 Receive invoice 2 Check for PO number If no PO number send back to supplier If PO number log into system 3 Forward to purchasing for confirmation of receipt 4 Match invoice to PO If match send to manager for approval If discrepancy clarify with purchasing or escalate"
