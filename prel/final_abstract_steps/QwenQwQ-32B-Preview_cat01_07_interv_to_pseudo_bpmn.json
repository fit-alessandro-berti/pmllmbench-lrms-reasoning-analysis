    "Text": "First, I need to read through all the interviews to get a general understanding of the process. Let’s start with Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Mary says that when an invoice arrives, she checks if it has a valid purchase order number. If not, she sends it back to the supplier for more details. If it has a PO, she logs it into the accounting system, forwards it to the purchasing department to confirm receipt of goods or services, and then matches the invoice line items against the PO. If everything matches, she sends it to the department manager for approval. If there are discrepancies, she emails the purchasing team to clarify or escalates to her supervisor."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "So, the initial steps are: 1. Receive invoice 2. Check for PO number - If no PO number, send back to supplier - If PO number, log into system 3. Forward to purchasing for confirmation of receipt 4. Match invoice to PO - If match, send to manager for approval - If discrepancy, clarify with purchasing or escalate."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Next, Dan, the Purchasing Officer, confirms that his role is to check if the invoice details match the PO. He compares quantities, prices, etc. If something’s off, he contacts the supplier or asks Mary to hold the invoice until it’s corrected. If everything is correct, he sends a confirmation email back to Accounts Payable."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, incorporating Dan’s part: - After logging into the system, Mary forwards the invoice to purchasing for confirmation. - Dan checks if the invoice matches the PO. - If yes, he confirms back to Mary. - If no, he either contacts the supplier or asks Mary to hold the invoice."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Then, Carlos, the Department Manager, explains that once the invoice is matched and confirmed by Dan, he receives a notification to approve it. He checks the details and approves if everything looks good. If not, he can reject it or ask for further investigation."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So, after confirmation from purchasing: - Mary sends it to the manager for approval. - Manager approves or requests investigation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Lastly, Rita, the Accounts Payable Supervisor, mentions that she gets involved in exceptions, like when there are discrepancies that can’t be resolved or invoices without PO numbers. She coordinates between departments and suppliers to resolve these issues and then the invoice goes back into the normal flow."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, exceptions seem to be handled by escalating to Rita or involving Karen."
