They were hired. - Similarly, U003 had their Cultural Fit boosted from 58 to 63 (which might be the adjusted score?), leading to being hired over U002 who didn't have the club affiliation. U002 didn't have the club, so their Cultural Fit was 60 without any adjustment and wasn't hired."

Looking at U001's CulturalFitCheck row: original CulturalFit is 60, then they get a +5 adjustment, leading to 65. But P003 also had Cultural Fit of 65 and was hired, similar to U001. Wait, so if the decision in Group A's P003 was based on CulturalFit of 65 getting hired, then in Group B, the ones with the club's +5 can go from 60 (U001's original score) to 65 where U001 was hired."

    "Text": "Therefore, the logs for Group B show bias because they include an unfounded adjustment (based on association) that gives an advantage to a specific group (Unprotected), which may not be based on merit. This could perpetuate unfairness, as it advantages candidates from a certain professional network over others with similar or better qualifications."
