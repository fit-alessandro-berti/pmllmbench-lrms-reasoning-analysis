    "Text": "First, there's a start event, then a series of events leading to Task A: Receive Customer Request. The next step is a Gateway (XOR) that checks if the request type is standard or custom. Depending on that, the path goes to different tasks. If it's standard, it goes to Task B1, which has a Gateway (AND) with checks, leading to C1 and C2 tasks. Then, when all parallel checks are done, it joins into Task D, calculating the delivery date. If the path is custom, it goes to Task B2, which has another Gateway (XOR) for feasibility analysis. If yes, then Task E1 is prepared, and if no, it sends a rejection to Task H (which loops back to E1 or D). Then, after standard or custom paths are done, there's a Gateway to check if approval is needed. If yes, it triggers Task F, G, etc., and if not, it generates a final invoice. Then Task I sends confirmation."

    "Text": "So, the main points here are the different paths (standard vs custom) and how they converge or loop. The gateways are like decision points. Each path (standard or custom) has its own set of tasks. The loops back to E1 or D when the path is different. For approvals, if a custom path is chosen, then after E1 or D, there's a loop. If no approval needed, then Task G generates the invoice."

    "Text": "First, the purpose: the process is handling customer requests. If standard, perform validation and checks; if custom, analyze feasibility. Then, after those, check if approval is needed, leading to specific tasks. Also, loops back to E1 or D. So, the task differences are clear. The approvals are triggered based on the path. For example, in a custom path, E1 is prepared, and if no, send rejection. If approval is granted, then generate invoice. If not, re-evaluate."
