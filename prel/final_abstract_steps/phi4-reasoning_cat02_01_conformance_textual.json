    "Text": "Let's read prompt carefully: The text describes a normative process for handling orders. It says: \"the general idea is that an order, once received, should be handled in accordance with availability\". Process always begins with \"Receive order\". After receiving, next logical step is to check inventory (\"Check inventory\"). Then if inventory is sufficient, sequence: Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If insufficient then branch into cancellation scenario: after checking inventory, process directly proceeds to Cancel order, and then Close order."

According to normative process, Authorization should occur after check inventory and before packaging. So in case 2, the sequence is wrong because it's doing package items then authorize payment. This violates \"Authorize payment\" rule and ordering of packaging."

The description says if inventory insufficient, after check inventory, the process should directly proceed to Cancel order (so no authorization payment is allowed in cancellation branch). But here case 3 has both Authorize Payment and then Cancel Order. Also normative text says \"Ship order\" should never occur after a cancellation. In this event log, after cancelling, there's shipping. So two violations: In case of cancellation scenario, process should skip packaging or shipping if inventory insufficient; but instead we see authorizing payment and shipping after cancellation, which violates the intended process."

In such a case, after checking inventory, the process should directly proceed to 'Cancel order.'

The text says that if insufficient stock then branch into cancellation scenario: meaning that there should not be Authorize Payment at all because it's not needed when you're cancelling the order. And also, shipping should never occur after cancellation. But here, after cancellation, we see \"Ship order\". So violation."

But what does the process description say? It says if inventory is sufficient, then sequence should be: after confirming inventory, proceed with authorization of payment (ensuring that customer's payment method valid), once payment authorized, package items then ship order and close order. So in case 5, packaging step is missing. Is that a violation as per the text? The normative description says \"Once payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipmentthis is commonly referred to as 'Package items'.\" And it further states: \"only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with 'Ship order'.\" So in case 5, missing package items means that shipping order was executed without packaging. Therefore, violation."

    "Text": "I will now produce a final answer text:\n\nI'll say something like: \n\n\"After analyzing the normative process and comparing it with each case event log, the following cases deviate from intended process flow:\"\n\nCase 2:\n- Violation: Payment authorization should occur after checking inventory and before packaging. However in Case 2, \"Package items\" happens at 10:00 then later \"Authorize payment\" at 10:30, violating ordering rules.\n\nCase 3:\n- Violations: Even though the process should branch directly to cancellation after insufficient inventory, this case includes additional steps that are not consistent with a cancelled order. Specifically, after checking inventory and authorizing payment (which is not part of a cancellation scenario), then \"Cancel order\" occurs at 10:00 followed by \"Ship order\" at 10:30. The normative process explicitly prohibits shipping an order that was canceled.\n\nCase 5:\n- Violation: In the sequence for sufficient inventory orders, after authorization payment, packaging items is mandatory before shipping. However, in Case 5, the step \"Package items\" is missing and the order goes directly from authorizing payment to shipping, which violates the requirement that items must be packaged prior to shipment.\n\nCases 1 and 4 are consistent with normative process flow."
