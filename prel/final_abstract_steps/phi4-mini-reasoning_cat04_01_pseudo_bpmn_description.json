    "Text": "First, the process starts with a Start Event. Then theres an initial Task A: Receive Customer Request. Thats straightforwardwhen a customer sends a request, this task kicks off. After that, there are two parallel paths based on a Gateway (XOR) checking the request type: Standard or Custom."

These must both complete before proceeding. Then it jumps to a Join Gateway indicating all parallel checks are done. From there, Task D calculates the delivery date."

If yes, then E1 (Prepare Custom Quotation) follows. If no, E2 sends a rejection notice and loops back to Start Event? Wait, but the End Event is mentioned later. Hmm, maybe when its not feasible, they end the process or restart from start? The diagram says End Event at the bottom, so perhaps Rejection Notice leads to termination."

Custom paths have a feasibility check early on. Both may require approvals based on business criteria. Approvals or lack thereof can lead to different outcomesinvoice generation or re-evaluation/loopback."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in the diagram, after H (Re-evaluate Conditions), it loops back specifically to E1 (Custom) or D (Standard). So if its from the Custom paths rejection of approval, they go back to preparing quotation again. For Standard, looping back to calculate delivery date again. That suggests that rework is only allowed for certain paths depending on where the failure occurred."

    "Text": "I need to make sure all gateways and tasks are correctly mapped. The initial XOR splits into two separate flows: Type = Standard and Type = Custom. Each of those then have their own sub-flows with AND/OR gateways as needed. The convergence points are after completing each paths necessary checks, then again after both paths finish, merging back. Then the approval step decides further branching."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
