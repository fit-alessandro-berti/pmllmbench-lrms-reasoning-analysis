    "Text": "It begins with market research and R&D to design a smartphone prototype. Then, they secure components from various countries: microprocessors from Taiwan, camera modules from Japan, OLED screens from South Korea, and sensors and memory from Germany and the USA. All these components are shipped to an assembly plant in Malaysia for 24/7 assembly. After assembly, there are quality checks; if they pass, the phones are packed and labeled, then shipped to different regions via air freight or cargo ship, depending on the market. Upon arrival, there's customs clearance and regulatory compliance, followed by distribution to regional centers, where they're warehoused, sent to retailers, fulfilled for e-commerce orders, or shipped directly for VIP/pre-orders. Finally, there's monitoring of inventory and sales forecasts to adjust orders to suppliers or proceed to the next sales cycle."
