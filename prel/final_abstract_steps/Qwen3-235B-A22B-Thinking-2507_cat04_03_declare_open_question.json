The existence constraints for Receive_Application and Gather_Additional_Documents make sense - you cant process a loan without receiving it, and additional docs are always needed for verification. The absence of Proceed_Without_Compliance is obviously critical for regulatory adherence."

In practice, this probably prevents multiple conflicting credit checks that could confuse the application status.

The chainprecedence from Authorize_Contract_Terms to Preliminary_Credit_Check seems odd at first glance - why would contract authorization precede credit check? Wait no, looking closer: its actually Authorize_Contract_Terms (F) having chainprecedence over Preliminary_Credit_Check (B), but logically B must come before F. This might be an error in the model or my interpretation."
