    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

However, the example should be specific. So perhaps the constraints are added for each sensitive attribute check activity (CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantGender, CheckApplicantAge) and their respective decisions. But since the example given uses CheckApplicantRace, I'll focus on that. The user can extrapolate to other attributes."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, the rationale for each: - Coexistence ensures that decisions affecting minorities are accompanied by a manual review, preventing unchecked biased decisions. - Response ensures that after checking a sensitive attribute, a mitigation check is mandatory, adding a layer of fairness. - Non-succession prevents a direct link from a sensitive check to a rejection, avoiding immediate bias without review."

    "Text": "Also, the keys like \"Reject_Minority\" and \"Approve_Minority\" might need to be actual activity names in the process. If the original model uses \"FinalDecision\" as an activity, perhaps the decisions are more specific like \"Reject\" and \"Approve\", but tied to sensitive attributes. So the example uses Reject_Minority as a separate activity, which may be part of the process. If not, maybe the constraints should apply to the general Reject activity when related to a sensitive group. However, the user's example might require adding these specific activities. Assuming the process includes these detailed activities, the constraints are correctly added."
