Cutting Metal (Events 4-6): High temp (50-58C), high vibration (30-38Hz), material flow 5 units/s... 3. Assembling Parts (Events 7-8): After cutting, the machines temperature drops a bit... Vibration lower, material flow 2 units/s... 4. Welding (Event 9): Sudden jump in temp to 80C, very high vibration (50Hz), but no material flow... 5. Quality Inspection (Events 11-12): Lower temp (25C), some material flow (1 unit/s), tool moving to 20mm... Event 10... maybe its part of cooling after welding, but not an activity... So the main activities are the four steps between idle states."
