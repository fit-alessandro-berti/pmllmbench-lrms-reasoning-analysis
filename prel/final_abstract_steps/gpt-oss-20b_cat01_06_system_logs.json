That includes typing, save, switch to Chrome etc? Wait the user switched from Word to Chrome while still in same session? They might be working on the same task of preparing the report; but we can treat each distinct activity as separate case if they are independent."

Sequence until close at 09:07. Case002 - Email Reply about Annual Meeting Events from switch to Chrome until send email and back to Acrobat? Actually after send email they switched to Acrobat; so email reply ends before switch out. So events from click open email until send email inclusive. Case003 - Review Report_Draft.pdf in Acrobat Events from switch to Acrobat until scroll/hightlight etc maybe end when no more events for that window before next app change. Case004 - Update Budget_2024.xlsx in Excel Case005 - Editing Quarterly_Report.docx"
