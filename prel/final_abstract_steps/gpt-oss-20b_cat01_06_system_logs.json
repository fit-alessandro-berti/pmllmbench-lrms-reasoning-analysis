That includes typing, save, switch to Chrome etc? Wait the user switched from Word to Chrome while still in same session? They might be working on the same task of preparing the report; but we can treat each distinct activity as separate case if they are independent."

    "Text": "Simpler approach: Each distinct application window is a case. So: Case ID: - DOC1_EDIT - EMAIL_REPLY - PDF_REVIEW - EXCEL_UPDATE - DOC2_EDIT But we also have switching back to Word for inserting reference; that could be part of DOC1_EDIT or separate? Might treat as part of DOC1_EDIT because its same document."

    "Text": "Lets propose: Case 001 - Editing Document1.docx Events: FOCUS at 08:59... Actually first focus was Quarterly_Report; but first event for Doc1 is focus at 09:00. Sequence until close at 09:07. Case002 - Email Reply about Annual Meeting Events from switch to Chrome until send email and back to Acrobat? Actually after send email they switched to Acrobat; so email reply ends before switch out. So events from click open email until send email inclusive. Case003 - Review Report_Draft.pdf in Acrobat Events from switch to Acrobat until scroll/hightlight etc maybe end when no more events for that window before next app change. Case004 - Update Budget_2024.xlsx in Excel Case005 - Editing Quarterly_Report.docx Alternatively combine Doc2 with earlier quarter report? Its separate session after closing previous doc."

    "Text": "Ok produce table with columns CaseID Activity Timestamp Additional attributes like App/Window maybe optional. Lets create event log rows sorted chronologically per case id grouping accordingly. Well produce table with columns CaseID | Activity | Timestamp | App | Window | Details Explain logic after table. Use LaTeX for timestamps? Not necessary; just plain text inside table cells fine. But formatting guidelines say use LaTeX for math expressions only; no math here so fine. Use markdown table format with code block? Better present as markdown table outside code block because easier readability. Provide explanation afterwards. Lets craft final answer accordingly."
