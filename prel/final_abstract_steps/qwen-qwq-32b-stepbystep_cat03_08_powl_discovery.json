Then the loop would be: do AS, then either exit, or do IQC followed by AS again."

    "Text": "Wait, no: the loop starts with A, then you can choose to exit, or do B and then A again. Wait, no, the description says: 'execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again, repeating until the loop is exited.' So the structure is A, then either exit or B followed by A again. So the loop structure is: A followed by (B and A) or exit. Therefore, to model the AS and IQC loop: the loop's A is AS, and B is IQC. So the loop would be * (AS, IQC). So the flow would be: first AS is executed, then you can exit the loop (so proceed) or do IQC followed by AS again. Wait, but in the logs, after the first IQC comes another AS. So the first iteration is AS (A) then IQC (B), then back to A (AS). So this matches the loop operator's structure. Because after A (AS) you can choose to exit or go to B (IQC) then A (AS again). Therefore, the AS and IQC steps are in a loop. So that loop is represented as a LOOP operator with AS and IQC."

The LOOP operator is * (A, B), so the loop would be structured so that after doing A (TST?), then B (RT?), then back to A again. Wait, let me think. Suppose the loop is structured as * (TST, RT). Then the first time, you do TST (A), then you can exit or do RT (B) then TST again (A). ... The first execution is TST (A), then if you loop, you do RT (B) followed by A (TST again). So that seems to fit. So the loop for the testing phase would be * (TST, RT)."
