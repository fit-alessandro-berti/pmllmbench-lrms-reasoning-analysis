    "Text": "Questions 1 Initial contact and document review What specific documents are required Are there variations by city or property type How is the property coordinator trained to identify missing or outdated documents Are there checklists or guidelines What happens if the landlord cannot provide a required document Are there alternatives or waivers 2 Recording Property Details How is the accuracy of the recorded property details like square footage amenities verified Is there a site visit at this stage Are there any standard categories for amenities or property types that must be used 3 Assignment of Property Manager How exactly is the assignment decision made Is it automated or does a supervisor assign What factors are weighted most How is the managers workload measured Is there a cap on the number of properties they can handle What happens if no manager with the required specialization is available 4 Introductory Meeting What are the key topics covered in this meeting Is there a standard agenda or checklist How are special conditions or policies documented and communicated to relevant parties like the marketing team or tenant screening 5 Photography and Inspection How are the photographer and inspector scheduled Is there a preferred vendor list What is the typical turnaround time for the inspection report How are repair issues prioritized Who approves the cost of repairs What if the landlord disagrees with the inspectors findings 6 Marketing Setup How does the marketing team determine the pricing model What market data sources are used How are the marketing materials reviewed for accuracy and compliance 7 Tenant Screening and Lease Finalization What are the specific criteria for tenant screening Are there minimum credit scores or income requirements How are multiple interested tenants handled Is there a formal scoring system How are lease terms negotiated What are the limits of what the property manager can offer without approval 8 Quality Checks and Internal Audits What triggers a compliance or financial review Is it done for every property or sampled What happens if a lease is found noncompliant during the audit How is that rectified"
