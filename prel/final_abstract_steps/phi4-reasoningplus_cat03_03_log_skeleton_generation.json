I need to decide: for a fulfilled order process, typically both steps occur and likely exactly once each. So maybe we enforce equivalence between IC and RP as well... But note: if we enforce both equivalence pairs then our activity occurrences should reflect that as well: 'PO': {1}, 'GSL': {1} and 'IC': {1}, 'RP': {1}. That is fine.
