The root is a sequence of receive_order, check_inventory, then a XOR node (which has two subtrees: successful_subtree and cancel_subtree). Then after the XOR node, there's a close_order. ... Wait, looking back: The root is defined as: root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order]) Wait, that's a sequence of four elements.
