Its a dictionary where each key is a tuple of two activities (like (SS, OP)), and the value is a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds. The key point is that we consider all possible pairs in the trace, not just consecutive ones - so for a trace like <A,B,C,D>, wed consider all six pairs."

For example: - Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP) should be quick since its about choosing a vendor - Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC) would have significant variability due to supplier lead times - Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA) might have delays if defects are found - Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT) could have long delays depending on inventory needs"

Also, some pairs like AS to others shouldnt be included since AS is the last activity."
