    "Text": "First, I need to understand what a temporal profile is. It's a dictionary where each key is a tuple of two activities (like ('SS', 'OP')), and the value is a tuple of (average_time, standard_deviation) in seconds. The key point is that we consider all possible pairs in the trace, not just consecutive ones - so for a trace like <A,B,C,D>, we'd consider all six pairs."

Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC) would have significant variability due to supplier lead times. Quality Inspection (QI) to Component Assembly (CA) might have delays if defects are found. Warehouse Storage (WS) to Distribution (DT) could have long delays depending on inventory needs."

SS to RC (non-consecutive) 11. OP to WS (non-consecutive) 12. QI to DT (non-consecutive). I'll convert all times to seconds for consistency (1 day = 86400 seconds). For SS to OP: 1 day avg -> 86400 sec, SD 0.2 days -> 17280 sec. OP to RC: 30 days avg -> 2592000 sec, SD 10 days -> 864000 sec."

    "Text": "I should double-check if these make sense: SS to RC should be longer than OP to RC since it includes SS time. OP to WS should be longer than OP to RC (since WS comes after RC). QI to DT skips CA and PT, so should be shorter than OP to WS."
