Because matching would involve checking that the invoice matches the PO and the goods received. So yes, Receive Goods and Receive Invoice should be done in parallel, but both must complete before proceeding."

The fixed code would have a sequence_block inside the root's sequence... parallel_block in the original code is replaced with a sequence_block... root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[create_req, approve_req, sequence_block, close_case])... Yes. This should fix all issues."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

The corrected model uses a sequence block after Approve Requisition, enforcing that CreatePO is done first... CloseCase is last. This ensures that all steps are executed in the intended strict sequence, preventing any invalid order."
