  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Text": "Following the initial diagnostic test, there's a loop. The loop starts with Specialist Consultation (SC), followed by an exclusive choice between Targeted Medication (TM) and Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT). After treatment, there's another exclusive choice for the re-diagnostic test: Follow-up ECG (FCE) or Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA). The loop continues if the results are abnormal, so the loop condition is based on the re-diagnostic test results."
