So events with the same age and gender should belong to the same case, assuming there arent two patients of the same age and gender being treated at the exact same time. But I should also check the timeline to make sure the events dont overlap in a way thats impossible for one patient."

    "Text": "Looking at the first event (1), its a male, 45, in ER. The next event (2) is a female, 62, also in ER. Then event 3 is a male, 28, in Surgery. So these three are different patients. Then events 4, 5, 6 follow. Event 4 is male, 45, ERsame as event 1. So thats likely the same patient. Similarly, event 5 is female 62, ERmatching event 2. Event 6 is male 28, Surgerysame as 3. So thats three separate cases so far."

Then event 10: female 62, Laboratory. Still the same patient. Event 11: female 62, ER again. Event 12: male 45, ER. Event 13: male 28, Surgery. Events 14,15,16,17,18 follow."

For instance, the male 45 starts in ER, then goes to Radiology (event 7), then back to ER for consultation (event 12), then discharged from ER (event 15). That makes sense. The male 28 is in Surgery department for registration, consultation, preparation, surgery, recovery, and discharge from Surgery. Thats a coherent flow. The female 62 is all in ER and Lab, which also makes sense."

For male 45: 08:05 (register), 08:10 (triage), 08:15 (Xray), 08:23 (consultation), 08:30 (discharge). Thats sequential. Female 62: 08:07 (register), 08:12 (triage), 08:16 (lab test), 08:20 (lab completed), 08:22 (consultation), 08:27 (prescription), 08:35 (discharge). Also sequential. Male 28: 08:07 (register), 08:13 (consultation), 08:16 (prep), 08:25 (surgery), 08:31 (recovery), 08:40 (discharge). All in order."

But Dr. Smith also did event 8 (lab test) and 11 (consultation) for female 62. Thats okay; doctors can handle multiple patients. Similarly, Dr. Lee is in Surgery for male 28 (events 6,13) and also in ER for male 45 (event 12). Thats possible."
