The main points are transforming the raw data into events with case IDs, meaningful activity names, timestamps, and other attributes. Also, grouping events into cases that represent a user's work session, like editing a document or handling an email."

Since the user might switch between different applications and documents, each major task (like working on a specific document or email) could be a separate case.

So perhaps each document or email is a separate case, and the case is determined by the document or email's identifier. So the same document would be part of the same case even if there are other activities in between?"
