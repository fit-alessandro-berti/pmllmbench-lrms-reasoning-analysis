Hmm, the sample events given are from cases A1 and B2, so I should look for patterns there. First, looking at the sequence for Case A1. The first few events are Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place on table, Align, Preheat. These all seem related to getting the metal sheet ready."

So maybe Material Preparation is a good first step. Next, after that, there's picking up a welding tool, then welding corners A and B, followed by measuring weld integrity. The welding actions and the tool pickup are part of the assembly process, right?"

The measurement might be part of the assembly step or a separate inspection step."

Wait, the visual check at the end could be a final inspection. Alternatively, the quality check after welding is part of assembly? Or is it a separate step."

The visual check by an operator is a final check. So maybe two inspection steps: one for welding and one final. But the problem says each high-level step should be a coherent stage. Maybe group the welding and its check, then the coating steps, then the final visual check."

    "Text": "Alternatively, group the Weld and its check as part of Assembly, since the check is immediately after. Then Coating steps (application and drying) as Coating, and then the visual check as Final Inspection. Alternatively, the quality checks (weld and visual) are separate steps. Let me see the problem's example: they mentioned Quality Inspection as a high-level step. Maybe the Weld Integrity check is part of Quality Inspection, but the visual check is also part of a final inspection. Wait, but the visual check is after coating. Maybe the high-level steps would be: 1. Material Preparation 2. Assembly 3. Quality Inspection (the weld check) 4. Coating Application 5. Final Inspection (the visual check)"

    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe the Coating step includes application and drying, since they are sequential and related. Drying is part of applying coating. So Coating Application and Drying could be part of a single step called Coating Application and Drying. The visual check is a separate step. Let me see the exact events again. Looking at the events: After Material Prep (steps 1-5), then Assembly (steps 6-8: picking tool, welding corners A and B). Then the weld integrity check (step 9), then coating application (step 10), drying (step 11), and visual check (step 12). So the Weld Integrity check is right after assembly, then coating is next. The visual check is after coating. So maybe the Quality Inspection is split into two parts? But that might complicate. Alternatively, the Weld Integrity is part of the assembly step's quality check, but the visual is a separate step."

So the steps in order for both cases are: Material Prep (retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating) Then Assembly (welding steps, tool pickup, welding, then the integrity check is after welding, but maybe the check is part of the assembly process's quality step? Or separate. Wait, the problem says each high-level step should represent a coherent stage. So perhaps: Material Preparation: all the steps from retrieving to preheating. Assembly: the welding steps (picking tool, welding corners A and B). The tool pickup is part of the assembly process. Quality Inspection: the measurement of weld integrity. This is an inspection after assembly. Coating Application: applying coating and drying. The drying is part of the coating process. Final Inspection: the visual check."

    "Text": "So that would make five steps. Let me check if that makes sense. Alternatively, the Quality Inspection step could be a separate step after assembly, then Coating, then Final Inspection. Yes, that seems logical. Let's see: Material Preparation (steps 1-5) Assembly (steps 6-8: pick tool, weld A, weld B) Quality Inspection (step9: measure weld integrity) Coating Application (steps10-11: apply coating and dry) Final Inspection (step12: visual check). That seems logical. The Quality Inspection is a distinct step after assembly, ensuring the welds are okay before moving on. Then coating, then the final visual check."

Final Inspection Wait, but the Coating Application includes both applying and drying. So Coating Application and Drying or just Coating Application with the drying as part of that process. The problem says to name them domain-relevant. Coating Application and Drying might be better. Now, let me check if the events in B2 follow the same pattern. Yes, their steps are the same, so the grouping holds."

    "Text": "Now, what about the Pick up welding tool by Operator B? That's part of the assembly step, since it's needed for the welding. Another possible grouping: the Measure weld integrity is a quality check after assembly, so that's its own step. The final visual check is a separate inspection step at the end. So yes, that would make those two separate steps. Now, what about the alignment and preheating in Material Prep? Those are all part of getting the material ready before assembly can happen. So those are all part of Material Prep. What about the Scan barcode? That's part of the initial steps, so part of Material Prep? Yes, scanning the barcode upon retrieval to log the part, so that's part of material prep."

    "Text": "Now, the names: Material Preparation Assembly Quality Inspection (for welds) Coating Application (with drying) Final Inspection (the visual check) Alternatively, Welding instead of Assembly? But the example given in the problem mentions Assembly as a possible step. Since welding is part of assembly here, Assembly is okay. Alternatively, maybe Coating Application and Drying as the step name instead of Coating Application. Hmm, but the problem says to give meaningful names. Coating Application might be sufficient if the drying is part of that process. Alternatively, Coating Application with the drying as part of it. The user might consider them as part of the same step."

    "Text": "Now, check the events again to confirm: Yes, applying coating and drying are sequential steps to apply the coating, so they form a single step. The final visual check is a separate step. Now, what about the Preheat metal sheet â€“ that's part of Material Prep. Yes, so the grouping seems solid. Now, are there any other possible groupings? Let me see: The problem's example in the prompt mentions Quality Inspection as a possible high-level step, which matches our third step here."
