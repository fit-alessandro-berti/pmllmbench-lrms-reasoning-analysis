So maybe \"Material Preparation\" is a good first step."

Hmm, but the problem says to group into coherent stages. The welding and the tool pickup would be assembly. The measurement might be part of the assembly step or a separate inspection step.

Assembly: the welding steps (picking tool, welding corners A and B). The tool pickup is part of the assembly process. Quality Inspection: the measurement of weld integrity.

Let me see the sample's events again: Looking at the sample, after preheating (step5), then comes the assembly (6-8), then inspection (9), then coating (10-11), then final check (12). So five steps. Alternatively, maybe the Quality Inspection and Final Inspection can be grouped as \"Quality Control\" but they are at different stages, so better separate.
