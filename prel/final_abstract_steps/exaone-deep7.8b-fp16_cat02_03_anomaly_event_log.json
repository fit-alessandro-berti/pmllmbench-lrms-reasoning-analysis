Each step is in order: Create Requisition (CR), Approve Requisition (AR), Issue Purchase Order (IO), Receive Goods (RG), Vendor Invoice Received (VIR), Match Invoice to Purchase Order (MITPO), Release Payment (RP), and Close Case (CC). No anomalies were identified in this case, so it serves as a normal comparison point."
