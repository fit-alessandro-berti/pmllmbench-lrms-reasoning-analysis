This leads them to get approved even if their preliminary score is lower than some others. For example, U003 starts at 695 but ends with 705 and gets approved.

    "Text": "This creates systematic differences because applicants from the Unprotected group with community ties have higher adjusted scores leading to more approvals even when their initial score is lower. For example, U003 in Group B starts at 695 (below P001's 720), but gets a boost to 705 and approved. If there’s another case where two similar applications exist except for the Protected group status and community affiliation, Unprotected members get an edge."
