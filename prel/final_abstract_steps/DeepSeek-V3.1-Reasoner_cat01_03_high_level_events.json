    "Text": "I notice the first few events involve retrieving, scanning, and placing the material, which naturally form a material preparation phase. Then there's alignment and preheating, which seem like setup for assembly. The welding activities form a distinct assembly step, followed by quality measurement and coating application which belong to finishing."
