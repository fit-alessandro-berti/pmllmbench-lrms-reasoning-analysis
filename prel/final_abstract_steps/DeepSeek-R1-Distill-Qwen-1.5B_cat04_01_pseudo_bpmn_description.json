There's a gateway here, and depending on the request type, it branches into either Task B1: 'Perform Standard Validation' or Task B2: 'Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis.' So, the first thing I notice is that the initial request type determines the next step."

If the custom path is taken, after validation, it goes to Task E1 for standard and E2 for custom."
