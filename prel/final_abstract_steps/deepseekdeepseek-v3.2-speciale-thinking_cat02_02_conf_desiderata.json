Lets extract the sequences: Case 1: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Approved Inform Applicant Finalize Documentation Close Case Case 2: Application Received Risk Assessment No prior Credit Check violates normative Credit Check Loan Decision Rejected Finalize Documentation Not allowed after rejection Close Case Case 3: Application Received Credit Check Happened more than 24 hours later just a desideratum violation Risk Assessment Loan Decision Approved Inform Applicant Later than recommended 48 hours again a desideratum violation Finalize Documentation Close Case No Followup Call"

Case 1 is Approved so Finalize Documentation must be before Close Case and it is. Ordering rules Credit Check before Risk Assessment yes Risk Assessment before Loan Decision yes Inform Applicant after Loan Decision yes If approved Finalize Documentation before Close Case yes and not finalizing after rejection na. So case 1 seems fully compliant. No skipping no reversed order no contradictory actions. So normative violations none."

    "Text": "For Case 2: Normative constraints Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment. Here Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check so violation. Also Loan Decision Rejected should not have Finalize Documentation. They did Finalize Documentation after rejection. Thats a violation. Also sequence Should be Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant for rejected Inform Applicant must happen then close case without finalization. The case also seems to skip Inform Applicant. In case 2 after Loan Decision Rejected we have Finalize Documentation and then Close Case. There is no Inform Applicant activity. According to normative constraints after Loan Decision the applicant must be informed of the outcome. Thats a strict rule. So missing Inform Applicant is also a violation. Thus case 2 violates normative rules."

Thats exactly what we have with Approved. All ordering rules satisfied Credit Check before Risk Assessment yes same day but after Risk Assessment before Loan Decision yes Inform Applicant after Loan Decision yes Finalize Documentation before Close Case yes and no forbidden actions. So normative violations none."

So desideratum violation. Inform Applicant occurs on 20240116 1500 Loan Decision on 20240114 1200. Thats about 2 days and 3 hours later more than 48 hours. So violation of the recommended timing. Also no Followup Call. So desideratum violation. Case 1 Check desiderata Credit Check within 24 hours yes Application Received 20240110 0900 Credit Check 0930 within 24 hours ok. Inform Applicant Loan Decision at 1100 Inform Applicant at 1300 2 hours later within 48 hours ok. Followup Call None in log so fails desideratum. Case 2 Credit Check timing Application Received 20240111 0800 Credit Check 0900 1 hour within 24 hours ok. Inform Applicant missing so no timing desideratum. Missing Followup Call fails desideratum."

    "Text": "Now part 3 When possible suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations. For case 2 the deviations are clear normative violations but maybe there is some justification Possibly the risk assessment might have been done in error or there was a misinterpretation of the process. But within the strict rules its a violation. For case 3 the deviations are only desiderata so we could justify that the credit check delay was due to high workload or the inform delay due to waiting for documentation and the missing followup call is optional. For case 2 there might be no possible justification that would align with strict constraints it is simply a violation."

    "Text": "Thus for part 3 we could provide plausible explanations for the desiderata violations eg high volume resource constraints etc but still the process is normatively compliant. Now we need to produce a structured answer. We should include 1 Identify normative violations case 2 has violations Explain each violation in detail. 2 Identify desiderata failures for each case list the desiderata that are not met with explanation Cases 1 2 3 have missing followup call case 3 also has timing violations. 3 Suggest interpretations justifications Possibly for case 3 the delays are acceptable due to external factors missing followup call is optional for case 2 the violations are serious and cannot be justified within strict rules. Lets structure Normative Violations Case 1 None Case 2 Credit Check not performed before Risk Assessment Inform Applicant missing Finalize Documentation performed after rejection Case 3 None. Desiderata Failures Case 1 Missing Followup Call Case 2 Missing Followup Call Case 3 Credit Check more than 24 hours Inform Applicant more than 48 hours Missing Followup Call. Interpretations Justifications For Case 1 all strict rules followed missing followup minor deviation. For Case 2 serious deviations no plausible interpretation. For Case 3 timing exceeds recommended but only desiderata possible reasons high workload etc overall normatively compliant."
