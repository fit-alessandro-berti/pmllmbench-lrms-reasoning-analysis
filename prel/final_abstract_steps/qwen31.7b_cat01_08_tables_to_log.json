Let me start by understanding the task thoroughly. First, the main goal is to integrate data from orders, items, deliveries, invoices, and payments into a chronological event log. Each event should have a unique case ID based on order_id, and include activity names, timestamps, and optionally resources. The key steps are identifying cases, deriving activities, mapping timestamps, combining data, and enriching with resources."

For each order, the events would be: 1. Order Created from Orders table 2. Items Picked from Order Lines table, since theres a picker_id 3. Order Dispatched from Delivery table 4.

So two events for this delivery. Then, the order 1002 also has DLV-5003, which is for the same order, but with different delivery details.

Then, DLV-5003 is dispatched on 2024-01-05T07:00:00Z and arrived on 2024-01-08T10:00:00Z. So the orders dispatch and arrival events are in sequence, so they are ordered correctly. So the events for order 1002 would be in the order: created, items picked, dispatch, arrival, items picked again? Wait, no. Wait, the items picked are for the orders items. So the order is created, items picked for each item in the order, then dispatch, arrival, then invoice, payment. But the orders items may have multiple deliveries. So the items picked are separate from the delivery events. So for order 1002, the items are picked on 2024-01-03T09:45:00Z ITEM-003 and 2024-01-03T10:00:00Z ITEM-005. Then, the delivery events for DLV-5002 and DLV-5003.
