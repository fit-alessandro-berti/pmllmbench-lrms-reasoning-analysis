Next is Assembly (AS). 5. After AS, there's an In-line Quality Check (IQC). Sometimes, IQC is repeated, like in Case 3 and 5. 6. Following IQC, there's another AS in some cases, which suggests that after IQC, assembly might need to be redone if quality checks fail. 7. Then comes Testing (TST). If the test fails, Re-Testing (RT) is done, and this can loop back to TST again, as seen in Cases 1, 3, and 5. 8. After testing is resolved, the product is Packaged (PK). 9. Labeling (LB) may or may not occur; in some cases, like Case 2 and 4, it's skipped. 10. After packaging and labeling, Distribution Planning (DP) happens. 11. Finally, the product is Dispatched (D)."
