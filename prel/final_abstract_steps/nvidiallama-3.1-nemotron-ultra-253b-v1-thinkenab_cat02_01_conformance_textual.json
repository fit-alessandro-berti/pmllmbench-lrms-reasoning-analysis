    "Text": "So the key rules are: 1. Check inventory must come after Receive order and before any payment or cancellation. 2. If inventory is sufficient, the sequence is Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Package -> Ship -> Close. 3. If not sufficient: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close. 4. Authorize payment should only happen after Check inventory and before Package. 5. Package items must be after Authorize and before Ship. 6. Ship order must come after Package and cant happen if Cancel was done. 7. Close order is the last in all cases."

    "Text": "Case 2: Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Package -> Authorize -> Ship -> Close. Oh, here Package comes before Authorize payment. But according to the rules, Authorize must come before Package. So this is a violation. The correct order should be Authorize first, then Package. So Case 2 is deviating."

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive -> Check -> Authorize -> Cancel -> Ship -> Close. Wait, after Authorize, they canceled the order. But after Cancel, they should not Ship. The normative says after Cancel, only Close. So Shipping after Cancel is a violation. Also, once Cancel is done, Package and Ship shouldnt happen. So Case 3 has a violation here because Ship is after Cancel."

    "Text": "So summarizing the violations: - Case 2: Package before Authorize. - Case 3: Ship after Cancel. - Case 5: Ship without Package. Now, lets make sure theres no other issues. Let me double-check each case again. Case 2 sequence: Check, then Package, then Authorize. Definitely Authorize comes after Package, which is wrong. Correct order is Authorize before Package. Yes. Case 3: After Cancel, they Ship. The normative says after Cancel, no fulfillment steps. Ship is a fulfillment step, so thats wrong. Case 5: Authorize -> Ship skips Package. So the Package step is missing. Therefore, Ship is not allowed here. Yes, thats all."
