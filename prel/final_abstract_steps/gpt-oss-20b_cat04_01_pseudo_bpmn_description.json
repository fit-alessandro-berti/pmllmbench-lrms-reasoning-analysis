    "Text": "We need to produce a detailed explanation of the business process described by the pseudo-BPMN. We should explain each step, purpose, meaning of gateways (XOR, AND), convergence and loops. Clarify differences between standard and custom request paths, conditions for approvals or rework steps."

    "Text": "Also mention that after either path tasks completed, there's a decision whether approval needed. If yes, manager approval; if granted generate final invoice else re-evaluate conditions leading back to earlier tasks (E1 or D). If no approval needed directly generate final invoice.

Provide details about each task's purpose in business context: validation ensures data quality; credit check ensures payment ability; inventory check ensures stock availability; calculate delivery date uses lead times etc.; prepare custom quotation includes pricing for customization features; send rejection notice informs customer of inability to fulfill request."

    "Text": "Explain approvals: manager approval required when high value/customization/complexity? The pseudo says Is Approval Needed? maybe based on order value threshold or complexity. If yes go through manager approval gate and then either proceed or re-evaluate conditions leading back to earlier steps depending on type (custom path E1 again or standard path D). Re-evaluation may involve adjusting price/terms/delivery date etc."

For Standard Path goes back from Task H -> Task D (calculate delivery date) maybe adjust due dates? Or could be other adjustments like inventory changes?"

Use plain text but can use LaTeX for any math? Not needed here but we can use formatting like bullet lists etc. Use Markdown formatting as typical answer style with headings sections explaining each part: - Overview - Start Event - Branching by Request Type - Standard Path - Custom Path - Parallel Checks & Join - Decision Points & Gateways - Is Approval Needed? - Is Approval Granted? - Loop Back / Rework Steps - Finalization & End Event"
