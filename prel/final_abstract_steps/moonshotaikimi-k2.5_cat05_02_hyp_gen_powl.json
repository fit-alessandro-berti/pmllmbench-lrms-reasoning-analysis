But loop must happen after A (A  loop), and xor must happen after loop (loop  xor). However, theres no edge from xor to C or from loop to C preventing C from happening before loop or xor. So yes, C can happen right after A, before loop (E/P) and xor (N) complete or even start."

Premature Closure (A  C): - System bug allowing closure button to be enabled before approval. - Emergency/fast-track process for certain claim types not properly modeled (e.g., zero-amount claims, automatic rejections). - Fraudulent activity (closing claims to meet quotas without proper evaluation). - Migration error from old system where closure could happen at any stage. 2. Loop between E and P: - Legitimate rework for complex claims requiring multiple rounds of evaluation and approval (e.g., additional documentation requested). - System design where partial approvals trigger re-evaluation (escalation thresholds). - Technical issue where Approve doesnt actually finalize, causing users to repeat the steps. 3. Skipped Notification (XOR with skip): - Business rule for certain claim types (e.g., small amounts, B2B vs B2C). - Customer opted out of notifications (privacy settings). - Technical failure in notification system modeled as a skip. - Fraudulent behavior to hide claim status from customers."

This means: Execute E, then (exit OR execute P then go back to E). So possible traces: E, or EPE, or EPEPE, etc. This is indeed anomalous because it suggests claims can be closed (C) after an evaluation (E) without a final approval (P), or with an approval followed by another evaluation."
