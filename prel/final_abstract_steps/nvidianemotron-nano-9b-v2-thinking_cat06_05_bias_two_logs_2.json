    "Text": "The bias here is that candidates from the LocalBusinessLeadersClub are given an unfair advantage in the CulturalFit assessment This could lead to them being hired more often even if their actual skills or personality scores are lower For example in Group B U003 has a lower SkillScore 75 compared to P003 82 in Group A but still gets hired The adjustment might be compensating for lower scores in other areas but if the adjustment isnt justified its biased"
