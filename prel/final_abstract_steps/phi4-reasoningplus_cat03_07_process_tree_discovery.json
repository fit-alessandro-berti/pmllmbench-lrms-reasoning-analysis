But wait, what is the semantics of the loop operator *? It says A is executed, then either you exit the loop or you execute B and then A again. So in our definition, we have two parts: In each iteration, first part = XOR(Sequence(RMI), Sequence(RMI, RMI)). That means if the XOR branch results in tau, that would mean no additional RMI?

The loop operator semantics: first iteration: execute A. So if we choose A1 branch, then the iteration yields a single RMI event from that XOR's chosen branch? But wait, how does XOR work in process trees? According to definition, X(A,B) tells that there is an exclusive choice between executing A or B. That means in each execution of the loop body, you have a decision: either execute A1 or A2.

Now then after that XOR decision (i.e., after finishing that chosen branch), the next step is to execute VF. So in one iteration, if you choose A1, you'll get: one RMI then VF; if you choose A2, you'll get: two consecutive RMI then VF. Then after executing VF, you have a decision whether to exit the loop or to repeat. In our cases, it seems that only one iteration of the loop is executed in both case 1 and case 3.
