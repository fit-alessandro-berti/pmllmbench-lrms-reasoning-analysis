    "Text": "Now Ill go through each case step by step comparing the actual sequence to the expected one Starting with Case 1 Receive Check Authorize Package Ship Close Thats exactly the sufficient inventory path No issues here Case 2 Receive Check Package Authorize Ship Close Wait Package items happens before Authorize payment According to the description Authorize payment must come before packaging because payment authorization makes sense only after knowing inventory is sufficient So here Package items precedes Authorize payment which violates the rule Thats a clear deviation Case 3 Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close After Cancel order theres a Ship order activity The description says that once canceled continuing with fulfillment activities like shipping is illogical So shipping after cancellation is a violation Also Cancel order should lead directly to Close order without any further steps but here Ship order happens after Cancel Thats another violation Case 4 Receive Check Cancel Close This follows the insufficient inventory path exactly No issues Case 5 Receive Check Authorize Ship Close Missing the Package items step before Ship order The normative process says Ship order should only occur after packaging So shipping without packaging is a violation here"

    "Text": "I need to explain each violation referencing the textual description For Case 2 the description states that Authorize payment should occur after Check inventory and before packaging Case 2 reverses that order For Case 3 after cancellation shipping shouldnt happen Case 5 misses the packaging step entirely before shipping Also considering ambiguities mentioned in the prompt like whether authorization can happen before certain conditions are fully confirmed or whether a cancellation step can precede certain checks in extraordinary circumstances But the description is clear about the required order so Ill stick to that No need to overcomplicate since the constraints are explicitly stated"
