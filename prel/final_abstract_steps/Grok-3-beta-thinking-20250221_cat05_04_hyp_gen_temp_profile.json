It's a dictionary where each key is a pair of activities, and the value is a tuple of average time in seconds and standard deviation in seconds between those activities.

    "Text": "Let's start with ('R', 'P'): average ~1.04 days with STDEV of 1 hour. This seems suspicious because the standard deviation is very low compared to the average. In a real process, you'd expect more variability in the time from receiving a claim to approving it. A low STDEV might indicate that approvals are happening on a strict schedule, which could be artificial or indicate some automation that isn't aligned with business needs."

In most processes, you'd expect notification to happen shortly after approval. A 7-day average suggests significant delays, and the high STDEV indicates inconsistencyâ€”sometimes it's quick, sometimes very delayed. This could point to bottlenecks or resource constraints."
