The key is to identify cases, derive activities, map timestamps, combine data, and enrich with resources and attributes. First, the case ID is straightforward: its the order_id from the Orders table. So each unique order_id will be a case."

The problem gives examples: Orders table: Order Created Order Lines table: Items Picked (but note there might be multiple items per order, so maybe one event per item picking? Or should I group them? The problem says produce one event per activity if its meaningful, or summarize if appropriate. Since each item picking has a different timestamp and picker, it might make sense to have one event per item picked."
