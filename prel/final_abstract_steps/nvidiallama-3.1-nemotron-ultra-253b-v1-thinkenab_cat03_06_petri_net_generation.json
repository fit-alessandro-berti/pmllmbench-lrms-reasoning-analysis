So the decision to go to RDS or proceed to FC is determined by some condition, which in Petri net terms is modeled by having two possible paths from p3. But how to model that? Normally, in a Petri net, the choice is non-deterministic unless controlled by places or guards. But here, we need to model the possibility of taking the RDS path or not. So perhaps after DV (transition DV), which connects from p2 to p3, then from p3, we have transitions to RDS and FC. But that would require a choice between RDS and FC. Wait, but the process can go to RDS multiple times. So maybe after DV, the process can either go to RDS or to FC. If RDS is taken, then after RDS, it goes back to DV for re-verification. So the RDS transition would lead back to DV's input place. Let's see:\n\nDV transition is from p2 to p3. Then, from p3, we have two transitions: one to FC (if documents are okay) and one to RDS. But RDS transition would go from p3 to some place p4, and then from p4 back to DV transition? Wait, no. Because RDS is a step that needs to be processed. So the RDS transition would take a token from p3, process it, and then output to a place that leads back to DV. So:\n\n- After DV (p3), the token can go to FC or to RDS.\n- If it goes to RDS, then after RDS is done, it should go back to DV to try again.\n\nSo RDS transition would consume the token from p3, produce a token in a new place p5, which connects back to DV.

So after RDS is done, the token is in p4, which is the input place for DV. So DV can process it again. So that loop is possible.\n\nSimilarly, FC is from p3 to p6.

The II transition is from p6 to p7 (if we choose to go to II). Then, the II transition must have an output place. So II transition takes token from p6, and produces a token in p7.

Then, p7 is connected to FC transition. But FC transition's input is p3. So this would not connect.

Wait, but FC's input is p3, so p7 should have an arc to FC's input place. Wait, no. FC transition is from p3 to p6. So after II is done (which is in p7), how do we get back to FC? The FC transition can only be triggered if there's a token in p3. So to loop back, after II, the token should be placed back into p3. Therefore, the II transition should produce a token in p3. So:\n\nII transition is from p6 to p3. So when II is taken, the token is consumed from p6, and produced in p3. Then, p3 can again choose between FC and RDS. That way, the loop is FC -> II -> FC.\n\nWait, but how does II transition get connected? Let me think again.\n\nOriginal path after DV is p3. From p3, you can go to FC (to p6) or RDS (to p4). So FC is a transition from p3 to p6. Then, from p6, you can go to CA (to p8) or II (to p7). If II is taken, the transition is from p6 to p7. Then, after II is processed, where does it go? The II transition would take the token from p7 and output to p3 (the same place where FC is waiting). So:\n\nII transition is from p7 to p3. Then, p3 can again choose between FC and RDS. So this creates the loop: FC -> II -> FC.\n\nWait, but FC is from p3 to p6. So after FC is done, the token is in p6. From p6, you can choose CA or II. If II is chosen, then the token goes to p7. Then II transition is from p7 to p3. Then, in p3, the token can again go to FC (to p6) or RDS (to p4). So that allows multiple iterations of FC and II.\n\nYes, that seems right.\n\nSo now, after CA, which is from p6 to p8, then CA leads to AP. Then AP to P, then P to N, then N to CL. And CL leads to the sink place.\n\nThe final marking is when the token is in the sink place.\n\nNow, let's outline all transitions and places:\n\nTransitions:\n\n- C (Insurance Claim)\n- CR (Claim Registration)\n- DV (Document Verification)\n- RDS (Re-Document Submission)\n- FC (Fraud Check)\n- II (In-depth Investigation)\n- CA (Claim Assessment)\n- AP (Approval)\n- P (Payment)\n- N (Notification)\n- CL (Closure)\n\nPlaces:\n\n- source (initial)\n- p1 (after C)\n- p2 (after CR)\n- p3 (after DV)\n- p4 (after RDS)\n- p5 (after RDS leads back to DV)\n- p6 (after FC)\n- p7 (after II)\n- p8 (after CA)\n- p9 (after AP)\n- p10 (after P)\n- p11 (after N)\n- sink (after CL)\n\nWait, maybe I need to adjust the places.

So the code for the arcs is correct.\n\nBut let me double-check the RDS loop:\n\nAfter RDS transition, the token is in p4. Then, there's an arc from p4 to p2. So petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(p4, p2, net). Yes, that's correct. So when p4 has a token, it's automatically moved to p2, allowing DV to be triggered again.\n\nSimilarly, after II transition, the token is in p3, allowing FC to be triggered again.\n\nThis should model the loops correctly.\n\nNow, the initial marking (im) is a Marking with source: 1.\n\nThe final marking (fm) is a Marking with sink: 1.\n\nSo this should be the correct Petri net."
