The number of possible pairs is 109/2 = 45, but since the order matters (like (A,B) is different from (B,A)), but in the context of the process, the order is determined by the sequence in the traces."

OP can pair with RC, QI,..., AS, etc. So the total number of pairs is 109/2 = 45. But the user wants a representative subset, so maybe include some direct pairs (like consecutive activities) and some indirect pairs (like SS to AS, which is the first and last activity)."

Lets say average 8 hours (28800 seconds), standard deviation 2 hours (7200 seconds). - OP  RC: Order placement to receiving components. This depends on supplier lead time. Could be days.

But in the temporal profile, each pair is considered based on their occurrence in traces. So if in a trace, SS is followed by OP and then RC, then the pair (SS, RC) would have a time that is the sum of SSOP and OPRC."
