    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Based on the process, the clear sequence and dependencies of activities such as Claim Registration (CR), Document Verification (DV), and Fraud Check (FC) were identified, and the flow was logically structured."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Following the patterns seen in the description of loops, it was inferred that RDS and II loops can be designed as transitions leading back to their respective previous places."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Each transition and arc was validated against the scenario to ensure alignment with the requirements to model the insurance claim process workflow accurately."

    "Text": "Assumptions about unmodeled conditions, such as the senior manager's approval threshold, were made to keep the process flow straightforward and manageable."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "It was hypothesized that transitions like RDS and II could simply loop back to the same place, DV_place or FC_place, as it was unclear from the problem description whether additional interactions were required."
