In Group A (Protected), looking at cases P001, P002, P003, none of the entries have a ScoreAdjustment. The 'ScoreAdjustment' is either 0 or N/A. However, in Group B (Unprotected), specifically the cases like U001 and U003, there's a +10 adjustment labeled 'Community Boost.'"

Alternatively, maybe the rules are such that with the 10 boost, they can reach the same level as protected group's scores. For instance, 705 (Group B U003) vs a protected group member with same preliminary score would have 695 (no boost) and likely get rejected, but since they received a boost, they get approved."
