The arrival (A) is the first activity, then RG, then IA, then the triage sequence (TI -> TC). So that's a sequence of A, RG, IA, followed by the TI and TC sequence. Wait, actually, according to the problem description: Step 1 says the patient arrives, then does RG, then IA. So the sequence A -> RG -> IA -> (TI -> TC). Then comes the exclusive choice between CE and FBP."

    "Text": "Then, after the initial diagnostic test (either CE or FBP), the results are evaluated. If abnormal, loop starts. Wait, the loop's structure is a bit tricky. Let me look at step 4: After initial diagnostic test (CE or FBP), evaluate results. If abnormal, enter loop: - SC (specialist consultation) - Then choose between TM or SPT (exclusive) - Then RDT (either FCE or FBA, another exclusive choice) - Then, if the RDT results are still abnormal, the loop repeats. So the loop's body is the part that repeats. So the loop would be structured such that the loop's A is the part that is executed, then B (the condition?) Wait, the problem says: * (A,B) is a loop. So the loop works as: first execute A. Then, either exit the loop, or execute B and then A again. So the loop can repeat A followed by B multiple times until exiting. Wait, maybe I need to model the loop's condition based on the RDT's result."

The loop steps are: SC -> (TM or SPT) -> (FCE or FBA) [the RDT], and if after that RDT is still abnormal, they repeat the loop again. Wait, actually, the loop's body is the part that repeats. So the loop would be the sequence of SC -> (TM or SPT) -> (FCE or FBA). Wait, no, the RDT is the test, which is followed by a check. Since the process tree can't handle conditions, maybe the loop is structured such that after the RDT, if it's still abnormal, they go back to the loop's start.

The B part of the loop is perhaps the check that determines whether to loop again. Since that's a condition, maybe the B is a silent step (tau) that, when taken, allows looping again. Wait, perhaps the B part is the part that must be done before looping again. Hmm, maybe the loop is structured as * (LoopBody, tau), where the LoopBody is the process that must repeat."

So the loop can repeat A followed by B as many times as desired, and then exit. Wait, the loop's A is executed, then you can choose to exit, or execute B and then A again. So each iteration is A followed by B, but the loop can choose to exit at any time. So if B is a silent step, then the user can choose to loop again."

The loop is * (LoopBody, tau). Thus, the loop can be entered any number of times (including zero?), but the problem says it only starts after the initial test's results are abnormal. Since conditions can't be modeled, perhaps the loop is part of the process tree, and the process can choose to loop as needed."
