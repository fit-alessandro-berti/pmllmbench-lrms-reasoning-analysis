This could mean that certain subgroups within B are favored, leading to bias. Alternatively, since Group A doesnt have any community groups, their scores arent adjusted, so their approvals depend purely on the base score. If the base scores for Group A are being set lower (e.g., 720 is their cutoff, but Group B can get boosts to reach that), but in U003s case, even with the boost they are below, but still approved, that might indicate that the CommunityGroup gives an extra benefit beyond the score."

This creates a systematic advantage for those in specific community groups within Group B, disadvantaging others in Group B without such affiliations and disadvantaging the entire Protected Group (A) who cannot access such adjustments."
