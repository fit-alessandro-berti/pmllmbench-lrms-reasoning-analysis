From the prompt, I see there are several categories like existence, absence, exactly_one, and init, which are for single activities, and others like response, precedence, succession, etc., which relate to pairs of activities."

Looking at the process, Idea Generation (IG) is the starting point, so IG must exist. Similarly, Final Launch (FL) is the end, so FL must exist.
