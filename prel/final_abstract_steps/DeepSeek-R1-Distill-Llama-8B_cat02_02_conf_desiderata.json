    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Starting with Case 1. Let me look at each activity in order. The application was received at 09:00, then credit check at 09:30, risk assessment at 10:00, loan decision at 11:00, inform applicant at 13:00, finalize documentation at 13:30, and close case at 14:00. That seems to follow the exact sequence: application credit check risk assessment loan decision inform finalize close. So, no issues here in terms of the strict rules."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Moving on to Case 2. Lets check the order. Application received at 08:00, then risk assessment at 09:00, which is before the credit check at 09:20. Oh, thats a problem. Credit check was supposed to come before risk assessment, so thats a violation of the normative rules."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "After that, the loan decision was made at 09:30, which is after the credit check, so that part is okay. But then, the documentation was finalized at 10:00 even though the loan was rejected. Thats not allowed; you shouldnt finalize documentation after a rejection. So thats another violation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Also, the case was closed at 10:30 without informing the applicant, but wait, in the log, the loan decision was made at 09:30, and the inform activity is missing. So they didnt inform the applicant about the rejection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - NE",
    "Text": "That might be a desideratum violation because they should inform them promptly, but its not a rule, just a recommendation. Hmm, actually, looking back, the desiderata mentions informing the applicant within 48 hours, and here its done after the decision but maybe not promptly. But since its a desideratum, its not a violation, just not meeting the recommendation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3: Application received at 09:00, credit check at 10:00 on the 14th, which is more than 24 hours later. The normative rules only require it to happen before the risk assessment, but here, the timing is slow. Thats a desideratum because its a recommended timing, not a strict rule. So thats not a violation, just not following the best practice."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then, the inform applicant was done on the 17th, which is more than 48 hours after the decision on the 14th. Again, thats late, but since its a desideratum, its not a violation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "They also didnt have a follow up call, which is another desideratum. So thats a failure to meet the recommendation but not a violation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "So, summarizing: Case 2 violated two normative rules: performing risk assessment before credit check and finalizing documentation after rejection. Case 3 failed the desiderata by taking longer than recommended for credit check and informing the applicant late and missing the follow up call."
