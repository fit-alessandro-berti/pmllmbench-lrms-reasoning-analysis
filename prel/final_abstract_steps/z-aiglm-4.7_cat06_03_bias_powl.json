    "Text": "3 Interpret the Subtle Bias The prompts comment in the code says Check if applicant is a local resident and member of a known community group Being selected for D leads to a subtle score uplift Since this is an XOR only some paths execute D Why would the model execute D In a process model an XOR usually represents a choice based on some data attribute or condition The bias is described as favoring a non legally protected group e g local residents community members The Mechanism of Bias The process explicitly routes people to a check D that provides a benefit score uplift Therefore those who satisfy the condition for D get a better score Those who dont satisfy the condition take the skip path get no uplift and thus move to Manual Review E with a lower preliminary score Since the model places this before the Manual Review E and Final Decision F this subtle score uplift influences the final outcome"
