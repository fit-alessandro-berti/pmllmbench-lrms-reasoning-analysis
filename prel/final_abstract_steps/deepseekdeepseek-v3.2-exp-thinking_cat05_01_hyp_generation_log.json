The normal flow expects Credit Check and Validate Stock before Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods. b. Case 1003: - After Credit Check, the next event is Ship Goods, then Issue Invoice, then Confirm Shipment, then Receive Payment. - Confirm Shipment is after Ship Goods, which is out of order (should be before). c.

Check if the resource performing the activity is from the expected department. Lets break down the queries we might want to run: Query 1: For each case, get the sequence of activities and check if they are in the expected order. We can define the expected order by assigning a rank to each activity in the normal flow. Expected order (with arbitrary ranks for comparison): Register Order: 1 Perform Credit Check: 2 Validate Stock: 3 Confirm Shipment: 4 Ship Goods: 5 Issue Invoice: 6 Receive Payment: 7 Then, for each case, we can check if the activities are in increasing order of these ranks."

    "Text": "Lets write the queries accordingly. Note: Since we are to propose SQL queries without hints, we will write them in a way that can be run on the given schema. We assume that the event log has one row per event per case, and events are ordered by timestamp within a case. We will use window functions to get the previous and next events for timing and sequence checks. Lets start with: Query 1: Check for out-of-order activities. We can assign the expected order for each activity and then check if the sequence in the case is non-decreasing. However, note that the same activity might appear multiple times? But in the example, each activity appears once per case. But to be safe, we can use the timestamp to order the events and then check the sequence of activities. Alternatively, we can define the expected order by the minimum timestamp of the activity in the normal process? Not exactly. We can use a common table expression (CTE) to assign a rank to each activity in the normal flow and then, for each case, check the order of the activities by their timestamp and see if the assigned ranks are in increasing order. But note: the normal flow is a total order, so we can assign: activity_rank = CASE activity WHEN Register Order THEN 1 WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2 WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3 WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4 WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5 WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6 WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7 ELSE 8 END Then, for each case, we can check the sequence of activity_rank by the timestamp. If we find a decrease, then its an anomaly. Query 1: WITH event_ranks AS ( SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, resource, additional_info, CASE activity WHEN Register Order THEN 1 WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2 WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3 WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4 WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5 WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6 WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7 ELSE 8 END AS activity_rank FROM order_event_log ), ordered_events AS ( SELECT *, LAG(activity_rank) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_rank FROM event_ranks ) SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, activity_rank, prev_rank FROM ordered_events WHERE prev_rank IS NOT NULL AND activity_rank < prev_rank ORDER BY case_id, timestamp; This query will return events that are out of order (i.e., the current activity_rank is less than the previous one)."

  {

    "Text": "Now, Query 2: Missing activities. We can check for each case, which of the 7 activities are missing.

Query 3: Negative time between consecutive events. WITH event_sequence AS ( SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_timestamp FROM order_event_log ) SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, prev_timestamp, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (timestamp - prev_timestamp)) AS seconds_diff FROM event_sequence WHERE prev_timestamp IS NOT NULL AND timestamp < prev_timestamp; This will return events that have a timestamp earlier than the previous event in the same case."

Query 5: Duplicate activities. We can check for cases that have the same activity more than once. SELECT case_id, activity, COUNT(*) AS count FROM order_event_log GROUP BY case_id, activity HAVING COUNT(*) > 1; These queries will help identify the anomalies we observed in the example data."
