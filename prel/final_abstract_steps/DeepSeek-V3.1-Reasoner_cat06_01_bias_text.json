    "Text": "The process has multiple stages, so I should systematically examine each phase. The automated steps seem fine initially, but the geographic/community integration check clearly introduces bias through the undisclosed score adjustment for local residents and club members. The manual underwriting phase then amplifies this bias through subjective interpretation."

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I need to explain why this is problematic: it creates an unfair advantage based on non-financial factors, lacks transparency, and risks perpetuating historical inequities. The legal aspect matters too - while not explicitly illegal, it could violate fair lending principles."
