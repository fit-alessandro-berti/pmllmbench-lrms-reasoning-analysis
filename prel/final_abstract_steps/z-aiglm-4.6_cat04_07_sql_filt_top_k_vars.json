This can be done using string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) or list_agg(activity ORDER BY timestamp). In DuckDB, string_agg supports ORDER BY. 2. Group by that sequence to count cases per variant. 3. Determine top K variants by frequency. K can be a parameter, e.g., 5. 4. Then filter the original event log to only those case_id where the case's variant is among the top K."

But using rank ensures ties. We should also mention that string_agg ORDER BY is supported in DuckDB. Potential improvements: For large logs, using list_agg and hashing for variant identification. But the user likely expects a straightforward query."
