    "Text": "In DECLARE models, rules such as 'precedence' specify the order between activities, while 'noncoexistence' prevents two activities from appearing together in the same trace. Recognizing these definitions helped identify potential conflicts in the model."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The 'noncoexistence' constraint between activities 'E' (Evaluate) and 'C' (Close) is a logical contradiction. Given the intended process flow, 'E' must happen before 'C,' requiring both to exist in the same trace. Thus, the noncoexistence rule is invalid."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The 'precedence' constraint for 'C' only requires 'R' (Receive) to come before it, but the process flow dictates that 'C' must follow all preceding steps like 'A' (Assign), 'E' (Evaluate), 'P' (Approve), and 'N' (Notify). This insufficient constraint allows invalid paths."

    "Text": "One possible reason for the 'noncoexistence' anomaly is a misunderstanding during model design, interpreting 'coexistence' as requiring parallel execution instead of sequential occurrence."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The insufficient precedence for 'C' may have resulted from incremental updates to process policies that introduced steps like 'P' and 'N,' but the constraint on 'C' was not updated to reflect the new requirements."

    "Text": "Confirmed the contradiction in the 'noncoexistence' rule by reasoning that the intended process relies on both 'E' and 'C' being present in sequence, not mutually exclusive."
