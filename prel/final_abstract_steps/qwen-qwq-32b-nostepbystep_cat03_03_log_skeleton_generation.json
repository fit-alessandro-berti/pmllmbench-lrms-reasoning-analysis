Let me start by understanding each constraint and how they apply to the given activities. First, the activities are RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP.

Also, perhaps generating a shipping label (GSL) and dispatching (D) should have the same occurrences. [...] So equivalence between GSL and D. [...] Wait, maybe the process requires that after reserving items, you must pick exactly as many times as you reserved. So RI and PI counts must match. So equivalence between RI and PI. Also, Generate Shipping Label and Dispatch: every time you generate a shipping label, you must dispatch, so their counts are the same. So equivalence between GSL and D."

Quality Check (QC) 6. Pack Order (PO) 7. Generate Shipping Label (GSL) 8. Dispatch (D) 9. Invoice Customer (IC) 10. Record Payment (RP). So the process flows in that order."

So for example, Check Availability (CA) must always come before Reserve Items (RI), because you can't reserve items without checking availability first. So (CA, RI) would be in 'always_before'. [...] Wait, the wording is a bit confusing. [...] Wait maybe the first activity is A, and the second is B. The constraint is: If A occurs, then B must have been done before A.
