Wait, no, the wording says if the first activity occurs, the second must have been executed previously. So if A is first, then whenever A occurs, B must have happened before it. So for example, Check Availability (CA) must always come before Reserve Items (RI), because you cant reserve items without checking availability first. So (CA, RI) would be in always_before. To require that CA comes before RI, the pair would be (RI, CA) in always_before. Because if RI occurs, then CA must have occurred before."
