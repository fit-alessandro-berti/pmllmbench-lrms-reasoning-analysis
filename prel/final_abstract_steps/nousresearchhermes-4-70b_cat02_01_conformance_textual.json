    "Text": "First, let me recap the normative process. The process starts with Receive order. Then comes Check inventory. If inventory is sufficient, the steps are: Authorize Payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If inventory is not sufficient, it should be: Cancel order, then Close order. Importantly, certain steps cant happen in a different order. For example, Authorize Payment must come after Check inventory and before Package items. Also, after Cancel order, you cant do Package, Ship, etc. Close order must be the last step in both scenarios."

    "Text": "Case 2: Steps are Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. The problem here is the order of Authorize Payment and Package items. According to the rules, Authorize should come before Package. But in this case, Package is done before Authorize. Thats a violation. The norm says that payment authorization must be after checking inventory and before packaging. So packaging before authorization is not allowed."

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Wait, after Cancel order, they Ship order? Thats a big no-no. The cancellation path should go to Close order immediately. Shipping after cancellation is definitely a violation. Also, after Cancel, you cant do Ship. So this case has two issues: doing Ship after Cancel, and also the sequence after Authorize. Wait, after Check inventory, they Authorized payment, then Cancel, then Ship. That doesnt make sense. If inventory is insufficient, after Check, you should go to Cancel, then Close. They authorized payment here before cancellation. But according to the norm, if after checking inventory, if you cant fulfill, you should cancel. The description says that if inventory is insufficient, the process must branch into cancellation. So if they did Check inventory, and then decided to cancel, they shouldnt have authorized payment. So in this case, the Cancel order step should come right after Check inventory. But here, they did Authorize Payment before Cancel. Thats a violation. Because once inventory is checked as insufficient, the process should go directly to Cancel. Also, after Cancel, they shouldnt Ship. So this case has two violations: Authorize Payment before Cancel when inventory is insufficient, and Ship after Cancel."

    "Text": "Case 5: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, wheres the Package items step? The norm says after Authorize Payment, you have to Package items before Ship.

    "Text": "So summarizing: Case 1: Compliant. Case 2: Package before Authorize Payment. Violation. Case 3: Authorize Payment before Cancel (when inventory is insufficient) and Ship after Cancel. Two violations. Case 4: Compliant. Case 5: Missing Package items before Ship. Violation. I need to check the exact rules again. Let me make sure. The norm says: Authorize Payment must occur after Check inventory and before Package items. Package items must be after Authorize and before Ship. Ship must be after Package and never after Cancel. Close order is the final activity."

    "Text": "So in Case 3, the order is: Check inventory -> Authorize Payment -> Cancel -> Ship. The problem here is twofold. First, after Check inventory, if inventory is insufficient, the process should go directly to Cancel. The fact that they did Authorize Payment here suggests that maybe they tried to process payment even though inventory was insufficient. Thats a violation. Then, after Cancel, they shipped the order, which is not allowed. So two violations here. Case 5 skips Package items. So Authorize Payment -> Ship. Missing the Package step. Thats a violation. Case 2s sequence: Check inventory -> Package -> Authorize. According to the norm, Authorize must be before Package. So this is reversed. So thats a violation. Now, interpreting any ambiguities. The description says that if inventory is not enough, the process should branch to Cancel order. But maybe theres a scenario where after Check inventory, you might authorize payment before canceling. But the norm says if the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock... the process must branch into a cancellation scenario. In such a case, after checking the inventory, the process should directly proceed to Cancel order. So directly means immediately after Check, no other steps in between. So Case 3s Authorize before Cancel is a violation because they should go directly to Cancel after Check if inventory is insufficient. But how do we know the inventory was insufficient? The event log doesnt explicitly state the outcome of Check inventory. However, since the case eventually Cancels, we can infer that Check inventory determined it was insufficient. Therefore, the process should have gone Check -> Cancel. But they did Authorize after Check, which is not allowed in that scenario. So thats a violation."
