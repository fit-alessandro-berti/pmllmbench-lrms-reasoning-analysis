    "Text": "First, let me recap the normative process. The process starts with Receive order. Then comes Check inventory. If inventory is sufficient, the steps are: Authorize Payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If inventory is not sufficient, it should be: Cancel order, then Close order. Importantly, certain steps can't happen in a different order. For example, Authorize Payment must come after Check inventory and before Package items. Also, after Cancel order, you can't do Package, Ship, etc. Close order must be the last step in both scenarios."

    "Text": "Case 2: Steps are Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. The problem here is the order of Authorize Payment and Package items. According to the rules, Authorize should come before Package. But in this case, Package is done before Authorize. That's a violation."

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Wait, after Cancel order, they Ship order? That's a big no-no. The cancellation path should go to Close order immediately... But how do we know the inventory was insufficient? The event log doesn't explicitly state the outcome of Check inventory. However, since the case eventually Cancels, we can infer that Check inventory determined it was insufficient... So this case has two violations: Authorize Payment before Cancel when inventory is insufficient, and Ship after Cancel."
