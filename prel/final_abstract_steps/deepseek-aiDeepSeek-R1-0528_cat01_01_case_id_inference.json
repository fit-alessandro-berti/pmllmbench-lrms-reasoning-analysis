The same patient (same age and gender) should belong to the same case, unless there are two patients with the same age and gender at the same time? But note: the events are interleaved and we have three distinct sets of patient attributes:   - Patient 1: age=45, gender=M   - Patient 2: age=62, gender=F   - Patient 3: age=28, gender=M So we can use patient_age and patient_gender as the primary keys to group events. However, note that two patients could have the same age and gender? But in this log, we see three distinct pairs: - (45, M) - (62, F) - (28, M) Therefore, we can form three groups."

Patient 2 (62, F): - Entirely in ER: registration -> triage -> lab test requested -> lab test completed -> doctor consultation -> prescription -> discharge. Note: The lab test completed event (event 10) is in the Laboratory department, which is a separate department but part of the ER patient's journey.

Case 3: Patient (28, M) - Surgery case for knee surgery. We can assign case IDs arbitrarily, for example: - Case A: events 1, 4, 7, 12, 15 - Case B: events 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 14, 17 - Case C: events 3, 6, 9, 13, 16, 18 But note: the events are numbered from 1 to 18.
