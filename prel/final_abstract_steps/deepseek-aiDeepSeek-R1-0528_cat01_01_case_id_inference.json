Patient 1 age 45 M starts in ER: registration to triage to X-ray in Radiology, common for ER patients to ER doctor consultation to discharge from ER. Patient 2 age 62 F is entirely in ER: registration to triage to lab test requested to lab test completed to doctor consultation to prescription to discharge. Patient 3 age 28 M starts in Surgery: registration to doctor consultation for scheduled knee surgery to surgery preparation to surgery to recovery room to discharge from Surgery. These sequences appear logical."
