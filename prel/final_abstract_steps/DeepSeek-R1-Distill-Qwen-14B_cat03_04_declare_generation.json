    "Text": "First, the model has several keys: 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init', 'responded_existence', 'coexistence', 'response', 'precedence', 'succession', 'altresponse', 'altprecedence', 'altsuccession', 'chainresponse', 'chainprecedence', 'chainsuccession', 'noncoexistence', 'nonsuccession', 'nonchainsuccession'. Each key has a specific structure. The keys 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', and 'init' have values that are dictionaries where the keys are activities, and each activity's value is another dictionary with 'support' and 'confidence', both set to 1.0. The other keys have similar structures but their values are dictionaries where each activity is a key, and the value is again a dictionary with 'support' and 'confidence' both at 1.0. However, these keys often represent more complex dependencies between activities."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Moving on to the other keys: 'responded_existence' indicates that if an activity occurs, another must follow. For example, after IG, DD should happen. So, IG's value would include DD with support and confidence 1.0. 'coexistence' means two activities can occur together. Maybe after DD, both TFC and CE can happen in parallel? So, under 'coexistence', we might have a key like DD pointing to a dictionary with both TFC and CE. 'response' is about one activity responding to another. For example, after TFC, if it's feasible, then PC (Prototype Creation) should happen. So, TFC's response would be PC. 'precedence' is about an activity preceding another. For instance, after IG comes DD, so IG precedes DD. 'succession' is the immediate next step. After IG, the next activity is DD, so IG's succession is DD."

Alternatively, perhaps if TFC isn't feasible, another activity like revisiting the design occurs, but since it's not specified, maybe we don't include it. 'altprecedence' and 'altsuccession' are similar but for alternative paths. Maybe if IG doesn't lead directly to DD, but perhaps in some cases, DD can be skipped? Not sure, but perhaps it's better to leave them empty for now."
