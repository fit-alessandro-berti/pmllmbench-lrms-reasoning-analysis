The acceptance scenario is given: complex insurance claim management process which involves a number of steps: 1. Insurance Claim (C) 2. Claim Registration (CR): the claim is logged into system. 3. Document Verification (DV): check documents. 4. Fraud Check (FC): check fraudulent details 5. Claim Assessment (CA) - adjuster decides compensation amount 6. Approval (AP) - if above threshold, then senior manager's approval required 7. Payment (P) 8. Notification (N) 9. Closure (CL) There is extra possibility: after DV, if documents incomplete, there is re-document submission (RDS). And similarly, after FC, if fraud check raises doubts, an in-depth investigation (II) occurs multiple times."

The instructions are: Construct an accepting Petri net for this scenario. The Petri net should have places representing states between these activities, transitions labeled with activity names, arcs connecting them logically sequence with possible loops. The code should use pm4py. We need to produce Python code that uses the following modules: - from pm4py.objects.petri_net.obj import PetriNet, Marking - from pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils import petri_utils The provided example code in prompt shows how to create a Petri net, add places and transitions, arcs, initial marking, final marking, and then remove sink place.

Actually what is the process? The text says In some cases if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues. So the possible paths from DV: - If documents complete, then proceed normally to Fraud Check (FC) - Else, if documents incomplete, transition RDS is fired.

So design might be: - Start place start - Transition CR fires from start, goes to a state after registration. - Then transition DV fires from that state and moves to DV state.

Alternatively, I could model it by having different transitions that represent each branch. But we want a simple Petri net with loops. We can incorporate decision points as splits: The transition from DV to FC is only enabled if there are tokens in some condition place? But maybe not necessary; we can simply design the net where both arcs exist and the firing of one transition consumes a token from the same place. Alternatively, I can use two places: one for DV complete and one for DV incomplete. But that might be too complicated. Alternatively, I can have a single place after DV (call it p2) with tokens representing a claim waiting to be processed. Then transitions: - Transition RDS: consumes token from p2, then produce a token in some re-document submission state which then goes back to DV. - Also transition FC: from same place p2, firing if documents are complete."

The simplest is to assume that theres a condition like a split arc and then two transitions for DV: one is RDS (which might be enabled if documents incomplete) and another is FC (if complete). But in Petri net, the enabling depends on available tokens and conditions. We can use inhibitor arcs to model conditions but its not required in this scenario.

However, this might be too ambiguous since both transitions share same input place. Alternatively, I could create two places after DV: one for complete verification and one for incomplete. But the process description says in some cases so its not mandatory that always the re-document submission happens; sometimes normal path is chosen. I think Ill design a net with additional decision points as follows: Plan: - p0 = start (with token initially) - Transition CR: from p0 to p1. - p1 = after claim registration. - Transition DV: from p1 to p2. - p2 = after document verification. Now, p2: It is a junction where if documents are complete, then we fire transition FC; if incomplete, then we fire transition RDS. But since both transitions share the same input place p2, we need to model that as a split. In Petri nets typically one token can enable multiple transitions if its a join/split with arcs from the same place? Actually in standard Petri nets, if a place is connected by arcs to two transitions, then firing any of those transitions will consume the token. So they compete for tokens.

Wait, but if documents are incomplete, the process would require re-submission of documents and then eventually returning to DV. But careful: when re-submission is done, do we get back to same place as DV? Id say yes.

Then from p_rds there is a transition labeled RDS_complete, which fires and then returns to p1 or p? Lets think. Actually, the re-document submission step logically means: after DV if documents incomplete, then customer resubmits documents. Once they are submitted, you need to verify them again. So that would mean: from the state of incomplete documents (p2) we do a transition RDS which leads to a state after document resubmission maybe call it p_rds. And then from that place, you perform Document Verification again (DV). But that means p_rds should lead back to DVs input (p1 or p2)? Actually, logically, after re-submission, we do the same DV activity. Thus maybe: Instead of p1 being after claim registration and p2 being document verification, then after RDS the token moves to a place that is fed into DV again. But in our net, we already have DV transition from p1. But wait, check process order: - Insurance Claim (C) triggers CR - After CR, the state is ready for Document Verification. So maybe structure: p0 = start, then CR goes to p_after_cr, then from there DV consumes token and produces token in p_after_dv. After that, if documents are incomplete, re-document submission happens. So after RDS, we get back to document verification stage (i.e., into p_after_cr or maybe directly into DVs input). But if the documents are complete, then go to Fraud Check. But wait, order: first step is Document Verification, so its input place is not CR but rather a state that indicates documents have been submitted which might be same as after CR. But actually, process: C -> CR -> DV. So p0 goes to p_after_cr, then from there DV consumes token and produces token in p_after_dv."

Now at state after_document_verification (p2): - Transition T_FraudCheck (or simply transition FC): from p2 to next state after_fraud_check. But also possibility if documents incomplete, then re-document submission: Define T_RDS: from p2 to a new place rds, and then from rds, a subsequent transition that returns to after_CR perhaps? Because after re-submission of documents, you want to perform Document Verification again. So define: Place rds (for re-document submitted), then transition T_RDS_Return: from rds to p1.

Similarly for Fraud Check: After DV, if documents are complete then: From p2 -> fire FC. But also possibility: after fraud check, maybe theres a loop for in-depth investigation if doubts arise. So define: Place after_fraud_check (p3). Then from p3, two possibilities: if no further investigation needed, then transition CA to next state; if fraud check raises doubts, then a loop for II.
