    "Text": "I can design using multiple tokens in the same place representing possible choices but typically Petri net modeling for concurrency uses inhibitor arcs or conditions Alternatively I could model it by having different transitions that represent each branch But we want a simple Petri net with loops We can incorporate decision points as splits The transition from DV to FC is only enabled if there are tokens in some condition place But maybe not necessary we can simply design the net where both arcs exist and the firing of one transition consumes a token from the same place Alternatively I could create two places one for DV complete and one for DV incomplete But that might be too complicated Alternatively I can have a single place after DV call it p2 with tokens representing a claim waiting to be processed Then transitions Transition RDS consumes token from p2 then produce a token in some re document submission state which then goes back to DV Also transition FC from same place p2 firing if documents are complete But how do we represent the decision Petri nets are usually non deterministic But we can simulate choices by having tokens representing different cases The simplest is to assume that theres a condition like a split arc and then two transitions for DV one is RDS which might be enabled if documents incomplete and another is FC if complete But in Petri net the enabling depends on available tokens and conditions We can use inhibitor arcs to model conditions but its not required in this scenario So Ill assume that the transitions are fired appropriately by tokens Maybe simpler Use a structure where from DV there are two outgoing transitions"
