Manufacturing and Assembly (Malaysia plant) 4. Logistics and Transportation (air, sea, customs, compliance) 5. Distribution and Warehousing (regional centers, retailers, e-commerce) 6. Inventory Management and Forecasting (demand planning, adjustments) 7. Quality Assurance, Compliance, and After-sales (recalls, warranty, regulations) 8.

    "Text": "We need 20 such questions. Let's brainstorm: 1. R&D: How does the R&D phase incorporate supply chain constraints (like component availability or lead times) into the design of new smartphone models? 2. Suppliers: What contingency plans are in place to handle disruptions from key suppliers, such as natural disasters or political instability? 3. Manufacturing: How does the assembly plant in Malaysia manage quality control across multiple shifts and ensure consistency? 4. Logistics: What challenges arise in coordinating customs clearance across multiple countries, and how are they addressed? 5. Distribution: How does the company decide which markets get just-in-time replenishment versus aggregated monthly shipments? 6. Inventory: How are sales forecasts adjusted in real-time, and what triggers a change in orders to suppliers? 7. Quality: What processes are in place to handle a product recall efficiently across multiple regions? 8. Sustainability: What initiatives are being explored to reduce the carbon footprint of the entire supply chain? 9. Technology: How do the digital systems integrate data from different stages of the supply chain to provide a holistic view? 10. Risk Management: What are the main risks in this global supply chain, and how are they mitigated? 11. Cost: How does the company balance cost efficiency with the need for speed and flexibility in the supply chain? 12. Regulations: How does the company stay updated and ensure compliance with changing labor and environmental regulations in every country it operates? 13. After-sales: How is after-sales support managed to ensure consistency and customer satisfaction globally? 14. Improvement: What continuous improvement methodologies are applied, and how is their success measured? 15. Partnerships: How are logistics partners selected and managed to ensure reliability and cost-effectiveness? 16. Market Variability: How does the supply chain strategy differ for high-demand markets versus emerging markets? 17. Currency: How do fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact procurement and pricing decisions? 18. Data: What key performance indicators (KPIs) are tracked to monitor the health and efficiency of the supply chain? 19. Integration: How well are the R&D, procurement, manufacturing, and distribution teams integrated to enable seamless information flow? 20. Future: What emerging technologies or trends could significantly transform this supply chain in the next 5-10 years?"
