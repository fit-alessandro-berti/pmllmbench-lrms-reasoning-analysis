Then Case 102 starts at 08:05 and closes on March 2nd at 09:15. Thats over a day later, so definitely longer. Case 103 is from 08:10 to 09:30 same day, about 1 hour 20 minutes. Case 104 starts at 08:20 and closes next day at 08:30, so around 24 hours. Case 105 starts at 08:25 and closes on March 3rd at 09:30, which is two days later."

Then from Escalate to Investigate (14:00) same day, 2.5 hours. Then Resolve next day at 09:00, which is 19 hours later. Thats a big wait."

    "Text": "Maybe the Level-2 agent took time to pick it up or investigate. Case 104: After Assign to Level-1 at 09:30, Investigate at 13:00 (3.5 hours wait), then Resolve next day at 08:00 (19 hours wait). No escalation, but long waits before investigate and resolve. Case 105: Assigned at 09:00, then Investigate at 09:10 (quick), then Escalate at 10:00. Then a long wait until March 2nd 14:00 to investigate again (over 24 hours), then Resolve on March 3rd. So the escalation led to a very long delay in Level-2 investigation."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Potential root causes: Escalations (cases 102, 105) leading to longer processing times, possibly because Level-2 agents are busy or take longer. Also, in cases without escalation (like 104), there are long waits between steps, maybe due to agent availability or workload. Wait times between activities: For example, in Case 102, after escalation, the investigation happens same day but then resolve is next day. In Case 104, after investigation, resolve is next day. Maybe agents are not working on weekends or evenings? Or maybe theres a handoff delay."
