C005 has a high score (740) and is approved, but C003 with 715 is not. This might suggest that score alone can overcome, but for C003, it did not."

For example, someone with a score of 715 who is not a local resident gets rejected, while a local with a lower adjusted score gets approved. - This could lead to unfairness if the underlying creditworthiness is similar. A non-local with 715 might be as creditworthy as a local with 700 adjusted."

How it favors groups: It gives a +10 boost to those in community groups, potentially tipping the scales in their favor. 3. Influence on fairness: This could discriminate against those without such affiliations, perpetuating inequalities based on social or geographic factors. 4. Implications: People lacking community ties might face higher barriers, even if their financial metrics are strong, leading to inequity."
