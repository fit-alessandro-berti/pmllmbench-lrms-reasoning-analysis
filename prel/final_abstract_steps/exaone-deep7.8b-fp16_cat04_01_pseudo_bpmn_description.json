    "Text": "Based on explicit descriptions of tasks (e.g., 'Perform Standard Validation' and 'Run Parallel Checks'), I inferred that both checks (credit and inventory) must pass for standard requests to move forward."

    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - NE",
    "Text": "When considering the loop back from 'Approval Denied' to earlier steps, I incorrectly speculated that the loop targets 'Task D' for standard requests. Subsequently, I realized it likely loops further back to prior validations or feasibility checks."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Noting that the diagram does not explicitly address the failure of parallel checks (e.g., credit rejection or lack of inventory), I inferred that error handling might have been omitted for simplicity but could logically involve a halt or alternative escalation path."
