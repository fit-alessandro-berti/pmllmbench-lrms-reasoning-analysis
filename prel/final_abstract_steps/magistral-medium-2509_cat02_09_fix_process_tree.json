    "Text": "The problem with this is that the parallel block allows all those activities to happen in any order which is not correct For example you should not be able to pay an invoice before receiving goods or receiving the invoice Similarly you can not receive goods before creating a purchase order and you can not match an invoice to a PO before receiving the invoice or creating the PO So the main issue is that the parallel operator AND is too permissive We need to replace that with a sequence that enforces the correct order"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But to be sure lets think about dependencies Create PO must happen after Approve Requisition Receive Goods must happen after Create PO you can not receive goods without a PO Receive Invoice must happen after Create PO since the invoice references the PO Match Invoice to PO must happen after both Receive Invoice and Create PO but since Create PO comes before Receive Invoice in the sequence its covered Pay Invoice must happen after Match Invoice to PO Close Case must happen after Pay Invoice So the correct sequence after approving the requisition is strictly Create PO then Receive Goods then Receive Invoice then Match Invoice to PO then Pay Invoice"
