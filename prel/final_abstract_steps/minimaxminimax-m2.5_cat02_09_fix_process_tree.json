In practice, after PO is created, goods receipt and invoice receipt happen, then match, then payment, then close. Typically, goods receipt and invoice receipt can happen in any order, but they both must occur after PO is created and before matching. However, there may be business rules: you cannot receive goods after invoice or match before goods receipt. Lets examine typical P2P."

This allows all sorts of illegal sequences: e.g., pay_invoice before receive_goods or receive_invoice; match before both goods and invoice; create_po after receive_goods etc. Thats wrong."

    "Text": "Thus the parallel block can be replaced with a proper ordering: after PO, there is a parallel block of receiving goods and receiving invoice (they can be in any order), but then after both, there is a sequential block for match, pay, close. Thus to fix: we need to enforce that create_po occurs after approve_req, then goods and invoice can be in any order (parallel) but must be before match, then match then pay then close. Hence the corrected process tree: Sequence: create_req, approve_req, create_po, (parallel block: receive_goods, receive_invoice), match_invoice, pay_invoice, close_case."

Alternatively could include a loop for repeated receipt But not needed. Thus answer should contain identification of issues corrected model explanation."
