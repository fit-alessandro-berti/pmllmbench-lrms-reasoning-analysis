    "Text": "The process starts with conducting market research. Then, R&D designs a smartphone prototype. After that, there's a parallel gateway splitting into four tasks: securing components from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Germany/USA. Once all components are secured, it joins back and ships them to Malaysia for assembly. After assembly, there's an exclusive gateway where either quality checks pass, leading to packing and labeling, or if they fail, it goes back for rework or scrap. Then, after packing, another parallel gateway splits into air freight and cargo ship options. These join again after customs clearance and distribution to various regions. Then, another parallel gateway splits into local warehousing, distributing to retailers, handling e-commerce orders, and direct shipments. Finally, it monitors inventory and sales, adjusts orders if needed, and proceeds to the next sales cycle."

    "Text": "1. Rationale: Why is market research the first step? What's the purpose of R&D in the process? Why are components sourced from different countries? 2. Improvements: What could make the process more efficient? How can we reduce delays in component sourcing? Is there a better way to handle quality checks? 3. Risks: What risks are involved in sourcing from multiple countries? How can delays in shipping affect the process? What happens if quality checks fail? 4. Decision-Making: How are decisions made to choose suppliers? How are the two shipping options (air or cargo) decided? How is the decision to adjust orders made? 5. Communication: How are stakeholders kept informed about component delays? How are suppliers updated on assembly needs? How are customers notified about product issues? 6. Performance: How is the success of each task measured? How are the costs of each component tracked? How is the assembly efficiency assessed?"
