After that, there's a parallel gateway splitting into four tasks: securing components from Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and Germany/USA. Once all components are secured, it joins back and ships them to Malaysia for assembly. After assembly, there's an exclusive gateway where either quality checks pass, leading to packing and labeling, or if they fail, it goes back for rework or scrap."

Then, another parallel gateway splits into local warehousing, distributing to retailers, handling e-commerce orders, and direct shipments."
