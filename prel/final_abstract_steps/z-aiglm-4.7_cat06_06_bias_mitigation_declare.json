    "Text": "To target only sensitive applicants, we need to condition on the attribute. In DECLARE, constraints are purely based on activity names, not data values. So we cannot directly constrain based on data attributes like ApplicantRace: Minority. Unless we encode the attribute as part of the activity name, e.g., Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority."

    "Text": "One approach: use a precedence constraint: FinalDecision -> ManualReview? That would force manual review before decision for all, but that might be too strong. Alternatively, we can use a response constraint: MinorityDetected -> ManualReview. Given the complexity, perhaps the intended solution is simpler."
