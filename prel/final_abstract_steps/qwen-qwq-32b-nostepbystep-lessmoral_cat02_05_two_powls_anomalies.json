    "Text": "Also looking at the rest of Model 1 after Decide it goes to Onboard then Payroll then Close That part seems okay But the main issue is the order between Screen and Interview In the model Screen is followed by both Decide and Interview which creates a split But according to the standard process the sequence should be Screen Interview Decide So the model is missing that Interview comes between Screen and Decide so thats a major anomaly"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also the model uses a looponboarding which is a loop operator with Onboard and a silent transition The loop structure here might mean that Onboard can be repeated Wait the loop is Onboard skip So the loop would be execute Onboard then decide to either exit via skip or loop again But in the standard process onboarding is a one time step So having a loop there is an anomaly unless theres a reason to repeat onboarding which doesnt make sense here So thats a possible unnecessary loop which is a deviation"

    "Text": "So comparing the two models Model 1s main issues are the incorrect order between Screen Interview and Decide The model has Screen leading to both Decide and Interview which breaks the correct sequence The correct path should be Screen Interview Decide So the model skips the Interview step before the decision So in Model 1 the decision could come before the interviews which is a major problem Model 2 has the Interview starting before screening since Post connects to Interview directly which is a critical error Also the payroll can be skipped and the loop onboarding is unnecessary Comparing the two models which one is closer to the norm In terms of critical errors Model 1 has the decision before interviews which is a major issue Model 2 has even more critical issues interviews before screening and possible skipping payroll"

    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Wait but let me check again In Model 1 the edges are from Screen to both Decide and Interview That suggests that after screening you can choose between going to Decide or to Interview Or is that a parallel path Because in a partial order the edges might represent precedence Wait in a partial order graph the edges define the order constraints So if theres an edge from Screen to Decide and another edge from Screen to Interview that means that both Decide and Interview must come after Screen but theres no edge between Decide and Interview so they can be in any order That would mean that Interview and Decide could be done in any order after Screen which is wrong So the problem is that Interview and Decide are not ordered relative to each other So the model allows the hiring decision to come before the interviews which is a major flaw"
