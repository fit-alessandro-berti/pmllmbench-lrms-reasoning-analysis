I see terms like 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', which probably mean certain activities must or must not occur."

    "Text": "The 'existence' constraint has 'Receive_Application' and 'Gather_Additional_Documents' with support and confidence at 1.0. That must mean these activities definitely happen. So, every loan application must start with receiving it and then gathering more documents. That makes sense because you can't process a loan without the application, and often you need more info."

The regulatory requirements likely include consumer protection laws, data protection, and financial regulations that require thorough checks before any funds are disbursed. The model seems to balance customer experience with legal obligations, ensuring that the process is both smooth for the customer and secure for the institution."

I think they are there to provide alternative paths or prevent certain sequences, but I'm not entirely sure how they interact.
