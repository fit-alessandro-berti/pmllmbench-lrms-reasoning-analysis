Wait, perhaps the entire model is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the main components in sequence, but each component can have their own operators. Let me see: Let me try to outline the nodes and their dependencies: 1. Start with the initial steps: SR followed by CS. This is a partial order between SR and CS, so this can be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes [SR_node, CS_node], and an edge from SR to CS. Let's call this first_part. Then, the second step is the parallel DA and ACI. So their container is a partial order with no order between them, so that's another partial order (parallel_part) with nodes DA and ACI. The third part is the loop configuration phase, which is the loop between BNC and D&R. So that's an OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP, children [BNC, D&R]. Let's call that loop_part. Then comes the XOR between CD and MD (deployment_part = XOR between CD and MD). Next, the QA and SA must be done, so a partial order between them (qa_sa_part), which allows either order or parallel). Finally, the GLA comes after those, so GLA must come after the QA and SA part."

The loop_part must come before the deployment_part (XOR between CD and MD). The deployment_part must come before the qa_sa_part (QA and SA). The qa_sa_part must come before GLA. Alternatively, perhaps the entire model is a StrictPartialOrder that includes all the main components in sequence, but each component can have their own operators.
