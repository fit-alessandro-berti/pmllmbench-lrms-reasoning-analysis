However, maybe the Items Picked activity is per item, but the problem says to produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful. However, the example says Items Picked event(s) from Order Lines. So perhaps each item's picking is an event, but maybe they can be grouped if they are part of the same activity. However, the problem says one event per activity if it’s meaningful, so maybe for each item, a separate event, but maybe not. Wait, the example says Items Picked event(s), so maybe multiple events for multiple items. But the user might want one event per order for Items Picked if all items are picked. But the problem says if it's meaningful, so perhaps each item's pick is an event. Alternatively, maybe the Items Picked is an activity that occurs once per order, and the multiple item_picking dates are part of that activity. But that might not be correct. Let me check the Order Lines table. Each order can have multiple items, each with their own picking date. So for example, order 1001 has two items picked on different dates. So perhaps each item's pick is a separate event. But maybe the activity is Items Picked and the multiple items are part of that activity. But the problem says to produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, so maybe for each item, the event is Items Picked with the timestamp of the pick. But that would result in multiple events for the same activity. But the problem says if it’s meaningful, so maybe that's acceptable. Alternatively, maybe the activity is Items Picked and the timestamp is the date when all items were picked. But that's not accurate. The problem says to use the data as it is. So for each item's pick, there's a timestamp. Therefore, each item's pick is an event. So for order 1001, two events for Items Picked at different times."
