    "Text": "Wait in the sample data after welding theres measuring weld integrity Quality Sensor 1 followed by applying coating and drying Should coating be part of Surface Treatment or a separate step Since coating is a treatment applied to the product after welding grouping it as Surface Treatment seems right The drying using a heating unit is part of that treatment process"
