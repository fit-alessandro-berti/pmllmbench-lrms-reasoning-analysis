    "Text": "Case 1004 Sequence 1 Create Requisition 2 Approve 3 Receive Goods activity 3 4 Issue PO activity 4 Wait issuing the PO after receiving goods That doesnt make sense The PO should be issued before receiving goods because the PO is the authorization to the vendor to deliver goods If goods were received before the PO was issued thats a major issue This could indicate that the purchase was made without a proper PO which violates procurement policies and might lead to unauthorized purchases"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Additionally the invoice was received activity 5 after the goods were received but before the PO was issued But in this case the PO was issued after goods receipt So the invoice would reference a PO that was issued later That might cause discrepancies in the invoicing process"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now I need to explain why these are problematic based on standard practices For Case 1002 approving after PO issuance means that the purchase was authorized after the fact which is a control failure Releasing payment before goods receipt risks paying for undelivered goods Case 1003s early payment could lead to fraud or errors since theres no invoice or proof of delivery yet Case 1004s receiving goods before PO suggests no proper procurement process leading to potential unauthorized purchases and difficulties in tracking or auditing"
