So after assessing eligibility, they requested missing info, then validated the form again before approval. \n\nCase 2: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC. So this case didn't have any RMI steps, went straight from AE to AD.\n\nCase 3: RA, VF, AE, RMI twice, then VF again, followed by AD, SC, AC. So here, after the first RMI, they did another RMI, then VF again."
