I should ask about the reasons for parallel processing here. Are there risks in sourcing from multiple countries? Maybe geopolitical issues?"

Rationale for parallel component sourcing. 2. Risks of multinational sourcing. 3. Malaysia as assembly location. 4. 247 assembly challenges. 5. Quality check efficiency. 6. Rework loop metrics. 7. Shipping method criteria. 8. Customs compliance challenges. 9. Distribution center selection. 10. Coordination of distribution tasks. 11. Inventory monitoring tools. 12. Responsiveness to demand changes. 13. Supplier failure mitigation. 14. Cross-team communication. 15. Stakeholder conflict resolution. 16. SLAs for tasks. 17. Lead time measurement. 18. Quality metrics. 19. Cost vs. speed trade-offs. 20. Process improvement opportunities. Thats 20. Let me phrase them as open-ended questions, making sure they provoke deep thinking and cover all required areas without yes/no answers."
