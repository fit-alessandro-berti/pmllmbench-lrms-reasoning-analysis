The ones with the community group get a +10 adjustment in PreliminaryScoring. For example, C001 starts with 710, gets +10 to 720, and is approved. C004 starts at 690, adds +10 to 700, also approved. Meanwhile, cases without a community group (like C002, C003, C005) have 0 adjustment. C003, a non-resident with no community group, was rejected despite a score of 715."

Even if their preliminary score is lower, the adjustment might push them over a threshold. For example, C001s initial score was 710, which with +10 becomes 720 (approved). If another applicant without the group had 710, theyd stay at 710 and maybe not meet the threshold (assuming 715 is the cutoff, but C003 had 715 and was rejected, which complicates things)."

For example, if a non-member has a preliminary score of 710, they stay at 710, but a member goes to 720, potentially crossing a threshold. However, in the data, C002 (member of None, score 720) was approved without any adjustment. Wait, C002s preliminary score was 720 with 0 adjustment. So maybe the threshold is 715? Then C003s 715 was rejected, which doesnt make sense. Theres inconsistency here. Alternatively, maybe the approval isnt solely based on score. For example, C003 is rejected despite 715, while C005 with 740 is approved. Maybe other factors in ManualReview or RulesEngine, but the visible data only shows score and adjustments."
