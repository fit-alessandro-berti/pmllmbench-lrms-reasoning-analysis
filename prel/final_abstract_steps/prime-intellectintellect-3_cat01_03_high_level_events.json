    "Text": "Common stages in manufacturing might be Material Preparation Assembly Quality Inspection could be multiple Finishing which could include coating and drying We can also consider the time the events in each group are close in time For example material preparation events happen within 15 seconds from 080005 to 080020 Then there is a gap until 080100 40 seconds for the next event Then the assembly events are within 15 seconds 080100 to 080120 But note the time gaps between groups are larger than within groups"

    "Text": "Another approach sometimes in process mining we group by the main resource or by the logical flow Here we see Operator A handles the material preparation events 13 but then the aligning is done by a robot and preheating by a heating unit So the resource changes But the logical step is material preparation Similarly Operator B does the welding events 68 Then the quality sensor does the weld check event 9 So the grouping by logical step seems appropriate We can also consider that the same resource might be used for consecutive events they are likely part of the same step primary factor is the logical grouping"

    "Text": "Therefore it is better to have two separate quality steps Given the above I propose the following grouping HighLevel Step 1 Material Preparation Events Retrieve raw metal sheet Scan barcode Place metal sheet on table Align metal sheet Preheat metal sheet Rationale These events are all related to preparing the raw material Alternatively we might combine the two quality steps into one step called Quality Inspection but then we have non consecutive events Therefore we must have two separate steps for the two inspections we stick to five distinct steps"
