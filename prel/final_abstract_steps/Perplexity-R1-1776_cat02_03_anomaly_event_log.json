Any deviation from this order might be an anomaly."

Also, matching invoice to PO happens on Feb 5 after payment was already released on Feb 3. So they paid without matching first. That's bad because you need to match invoice to PO and goods receipt to ensure accuracy before paying."

Case1003: - Releasing payment before receiving goods and invoice; paying without matching. Case1004: - Receiving goods before issuing the purchase order. These are all deviations from standard P2P process which require certain steps in order to ensure proper controls, like approvals before issuing POs, verifying receipt of goods and matching invoices before payment."
