The coexistence constraint links Gather_Additional_Documents to authorize contract terms, but maybe thats a prerequisite for the credit check? Wait, looking at the models succession constraint: Preliminary_Credit_Check leads to Gather_Additional_Documents. So after the credit check comes gathering documents. But why? Maybe because the credit check might require certain documents, so gathering them is necessary before proceeding. Or perhaps the credit check is done first, then additional docs are needed. The models absence constraint has Proceed_Without_Compliance, which is forbidden, so maybe if compliance steps arent met, you cant proceed."

That makes sense because you want to check the offers compliance and quality before finalizing. Then authorize the contract terms (Authorize_Contract_Terms), which probably triggers transferring funds (Transfer_Funds) and notifying the customer (Notify_Customer). The chain constraints like chainresponse links Assemble to Transfer, and chainprecedence connects Authorize to Notify. So the order would be Assemble  Transfer  Notify, but also Authorize might be after Assemble."
