They want me to create a list of targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and improve understanding of this process. The questions should focus on missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, and exception handling - but must avoid any SQL or technical implementation questions."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let me analyze this process carefully. It's quite complex with multiple stages: documentation review, property manager assignment, marketing setup, tenant screening, and quality checks. The description mentions several key touchpoints but leaves some gaps I should probe."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "First, I need to identify where the process might be unclear. For example: The documentation review stage mentions certificates of compliance but doesn't specify which regulations apply in different cities The property manager assignment criteria seem important but vague (e.g., geographic specialization needs clarification) The inspection phase has a dependency on landlord cooperation for repairs Tenant screening mentions multiple interested tenants but doesn't explain the prioritization logic"

    "Text": "I should craft questions that uncover these ambiguities. The questions must be open-ended to encourage detailed responses, not yes/no questions. Since this is for process understanding, I'll avoid anything about systems or data - focus purely on human workflows and decision points."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Hmm, the user emphasized avoiding SQL queries, so I'll make sure all questions stay conceptual. Also need to cover all requested angles: missing details (like which documents are most frequently missing), decision criteria (how exactly they weigh manager experience), roles (who actually approves the final lease), timing (how long each phase typically takes), and exceptions (like special insurance cases)."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let me structure questions around each major phase of the process described. For documentation: ask about common document failures. For manager assignment: dig into the weighting of criteria. For inspection: clarify repair escalation paths. For tenant screening: explore the multiple applicants scenario. For quality checks: confirm who does what in the audit."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should also consider pain points - the description mentions communication flows back and forth so asking about bottlenecks would be valuable. And since they mention landlords with unique requirements, I'll include a question about how they handle customization."

    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, the user said multiple decision points - I should ask about the most critical decision that could derail the process. And for timing, I need to know if there are standard SLAs for each step."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "checks description again Ah, they mention internal pricing models but don't say how often they update them. That's a good question about market responsiveness. For exceptions, the special insurance case is noted but not explained - need to ask how they determine when it's required."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "mental note Avoid leading questions. Instead of Do you have a standard timeline? ask How do you track and manage timeline expectations at each stage? Also must remember this is for a property management company, so questions should reflect industry realities - like fair housing compliance being non-negotiable."
