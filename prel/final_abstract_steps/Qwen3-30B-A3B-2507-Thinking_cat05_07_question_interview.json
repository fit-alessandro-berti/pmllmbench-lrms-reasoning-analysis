They want me to create a list of targeted, open-ended questions to clarify and improve understanding of this process. The questions should focus on missing details, decision criteria, roles, timing, and exception handling - but must avoid any SQL or technical implementation questions."

    "Text": "First, I need to identify where the process might be unclear. For example: - The documentation review stage mentions certificates of compliance but doesnt specify which regulations apply in different cities - The property manager assignment criteria seem important but vague (e.g., geographic specialization needs clarification) - The inspection phase has a dependency on landlord cooperation for repairs - Tenant screening mentions multiple interested tenants but doesnt explain the prioritization logic"

    "Text": "Hmm, the user emphasized avoiding SQL queries, so Ill make sure all questions stay conceptual. Also need to cover all requested angles: missing details (like which documents are most frequently missing), decision criteria (how exactly they weigh manager experience), roles (who actually approves the final lease), timing (how long each phase typically takes), and exceptions (like special insurance cases)."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Let me structure questions around each major phase of the process described. For documentation: ask about common document failures. For manager assignment: dig into the weighting of criteria. For inspection: clarify repair escalation paths. For tenant screening: explore the multiple applicants scenario. For quality checks: confirm who does what in the audit."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should also consider pain points - the description mentions communication flows back and forth so asking about bottlenecks would be valuable. And since they mention landlords with unique requirements, Ill include a question about how they handle customization."

Also must remember this is for a property management company, so questions should reflect industry realities - like fair housing compliance being non-negotiable. double-checking All questions must be open-ended: How do you..., What criteria..., Can you describe... - no do or is it questions."
