First, the task is to exclude cases that have the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' 'Create Order' 'Confirm Order' in direct succession, and where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. So the final result should be all events except those from such cases."

    "Text": "So, the approach would be: 1. Identify all case_ids that have the exact sequence of those three activities with no other events in between. Then check the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. 2. Then, exclude all events from those case_ids. So, first, I need to find the cases that meet both conditions. Then, select all events not in those case_ids."

    "Text": "How to find the cases with the sequence? In the event_log, for each case, we need to check if there's a sequence of three consecutive activities (in the same case) where the first is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', then 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order', with no other activities in between. Wait, direct succession means that the three activities are consecutive in the event log for that case. So for a given case, the events are ordered by timestamp. So for each case, we need to check if there's a point where the current event is 'Approve...', next event is 'Create Order', next after that is 'Confirm Order'. But how to check for consecutive events in DuckDB? One way is to use the LEAD() window function to look at the next two events for each row in the same case."

Wait, but in the sequence, the 'Create Order' is the second event, and 'Confirm Order' is the third. ... So the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is LEAD(2) - LEAD(1)."

    "Text": "But need to check if the LEAD functions are correctly used. Because for the last two events in a case, LEAD(1) or LEAD(2) would be NULL. But in the WHERE clause, we're checking activity = 'Approve...', so only rows where the current activity is that, and then next_activity and next_next_activity are not NULL. So the LEAD would only return non-NULL for cases where there are at least two more events after the current one. So for rows where there are not enough events after, the LEAD would return NULL, and the WHERE clause would filter them out. So that's okay."

Wait, but in DuckDB, the NOT IN might have issues if there are NULLs in the subquery, but in our case, the subquery selects case_id, which shouldn't be NULL. So that's okay. Alternatively, using NOT EXISTS might be better, but for simplicity, NOT IN should work here."

Then the case_id will be in the subquery, so excluded. Another case where the sequence is there but the time is less than 5 days: not excluded. Another case where the sequence is not present: included. Another case where the sequence is present but not consecutive (e.g., Approve, some other activity, then Create, Confirm), then it's not considered because the LEAD(1) for Approve would not be Create. So such a case would not be included in the subquery."
