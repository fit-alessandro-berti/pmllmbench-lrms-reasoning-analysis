First, the task is to exclude cases that have the sequence Approve Purchase Requisition Create Order Confirm Order in direct succession, and where the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. So the final result should be all events except those from such cases."

    "Text": "So, the approach would be: 1. Identify all case_ids that have the exact sequence of those three activities with no other events in between. Then check the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. 2. Then, exclude all events from those case_ids."

In the event_log, for each case, we need to check if theres a sequence of three consecutive activities (in the same case) where the first is Approve Purchase Requisition, then Create Order, then Confirm Order, with no other activities in between. direct succession means that the three activities are consecutive in the event log for that case. So for a given case, the events are ordered by timestamp. So for each case, we need to check if theres a point where the current event is Approve..., next event is Create Order, next after that is Confirm Order."

    "Text": "One way is to use the LEAD() window function to look at the next two events for each row in the same case. For example, for each event in a case, check if the current activity is Approve Purchase Requisition, then the next activity (using LEAD(1)) is Create Order, and the LEAD(2) is Confirm Order. But to do that, we need to order the events by timestamp for each case. So first, partition by case_id, order by timestamp."

    "Text": "So for the current row (Approve...), the next row is Create Order, next next is Confirm Order. So the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is the timestamp of the third event minus the timestamp of the second event. But the problem says the time elapsed between the Create Order event and the Confirm Order event of that sequence is more than 5 days. So yes, thats the difference between the timestamp of the Confirm Order event and the Create Order event. So for the sequence where they are consecutive, the time between them is the difference between the Confirm Orders timestamp and the Create Orders timestamp. So if that difference is >5 days, then the case meets the condition."

Then the case_id will be in the subquery, so excluded. Another case where the sequence is there but the time is less than 5 days: not excluded. Another case where the sequence is not present: included. Another case where the sequence is present but not consecutive (e.g., Approve, some other activity, then Create, Confirm), then its not considered because the LEAD(1) for Approve would not be Create. So such a case would not be included in the subquery. Yes."

Then for the first event (Approve), next is Create, next next is Confirm. So it would be detected. Yes. What if the case has multiple sequences? Like Approve, Create, Confirm, Approve, Create, Confirm. Then the first three would be detected, and the next three as well. But the case_id would be in the subquery once, so excluded. Yes. Another edge: if the time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days. Then the condition is >5 days, so not included. So such cases are not excluded. So the query is correct."
