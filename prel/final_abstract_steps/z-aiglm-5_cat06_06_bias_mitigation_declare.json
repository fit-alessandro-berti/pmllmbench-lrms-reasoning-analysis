    "Text": "We need to understand the task. We have a DECLARE model as a Python dictionary. We must add new constraints to limit bias. The example model is given; we need to update it with constraints that enforce fairness. We should consider that there might be activities that reflect sensitive attributes (like CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, CheckApplicantRace) and decision activities (Approve, Reject, RequestAdditionalInfo). But note that in the given model, the activities are: StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo."

    "Text": "Consider that the process, as described, might be susceptible to bias against certain applicants based on sensitive attributes. For instance, a FinalDecision of Reject might occur more frequently after seeing attributes like ApplicantRace: Minority without a proper check in between."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Add constraints like: Non-succession: Prevent direct succession from a sensitive attribute event to a decision event. Response/Succession: Ensure that certain decision steps cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes without first performing a BiasMitigationCheck. Coexistence: If a decision step occurs for a sensitive applicant, ensure a ManualReview activity always coexists in the trace."

    "Text": "The combination of response(CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck) and precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, FinalDecision) ensures that after CheckApplicantRace, BiasMitigationCheck must occur, and before any FinalDecision, BiasMitigationCheck must have occurred earlier. This effectively enforces that after a sensitive check, the next FinalDecision must be preceded by a BiasMitigationCheck that occurs after the sensitive check."

    "Text": "We could treat FinalDecision as the decision activity, and for sensitive applicants, we have FinalDecision_Sensitive? But then we need to differentiate. Given this, it might be better to not introduce separate decision activities; instead, we can use other constraints that dont require separate activity labels."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Precedence(ManualReview, FinalDecision) enforces that ManualReview occurs before FinalDecision. Combined with response from sensitive check to ManualReview, it ensures that after any sensitive attribute check, a manual review must occur before the final decision. The model remains satisfiable."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Add existence for ManualReview, precedence(ManualReview, FinalDecision), response from CheckApplicantRace/Gender/Age to ManualReview, nonchainsuccession from those checks to FinalDecision, coexistence(ManualReview, FinalDecision). This mitigates bias by requiring human oversight after sensitive attribute checks and before final decisions."
