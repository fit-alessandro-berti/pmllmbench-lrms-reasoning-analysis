Approve Purchase Requisition (optional, but usually happens before PO issuance). 3.  Issue Purchase Order (PO) (cannot legally bind without a PR usually, and definitely shouldnt happen before approval). 4.  Receive Goods (Goods Receipt Note). Usually happens *after* PO is issued. 5.  Vendor Invoice Received. Usually happens *after* goods are received (or at least after PO). 6.  Match Invoice to PO (Three-Way Match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice). This needs the PO and Goods Receipt to exist. 7.  Release Payment (Pay the vendor). Usually happens *after* matching/invoice approval. 8.  Close Case (Administrative step)."

OK.) *   * Feb 02 10:00 Receive Goods (Order: PO -> Receive. OK.) *   * Feb 02 11:30 Vendor Invoice (Order: Receive -> Invoice. OK.) *   * Feb 05 09:00 Match Invoice (Order: Invoice -> Match. OK.) *   * Feb 06 10:00 Release Payment (Order: Match -> Pay. OK.) *   * Feb 07 15:00 Close Case *   *Verdict:* This looks like the \"Happy Path\" or standard process. No anomalies here. *   **Case 1002:** *   * 08:30 Create PR *   * 08:40 Issue PO (**Anomaly 1**: PO issued before PR approval. This bypasses internal control.) *   * Feb 03 07:00 Vendor Invoice Received (**Anomaly 2**: Invoice received before goods are received. Not always illegal, but risky.) *   * Feb 03 07:15 Release Payment (**Anomaly 3**: Payment released *before* matching, *before* goods received, *before* PR approval. Huge risk of fraud or paying for non-existent goods.) *   * Feb 03 08:00 Approve PR (**Anomaly 4**: Approval happens *after* PO issue, Payment, and Invoice receipt. Makes the approval pointless.) *   * Feb 04 09:00 Receive Goods (Goods received *after* payment. Major risk if goods are damaged or dont arrive.) *   * Feb 05 08:00 Match Invoice (Matching happens *after* payment. Defeats the purpose of the match verification.) *   * Feb 06 16:00 Close Case *   *Verdict:* This case is a disaster of internal control failures. *   **Case 1003:** *   * Feb 02 09:00 Create PR *   * Feb 02 09:10 Approve PR *   * Feb 02 10:00 Issue PO *   * Feb 08 11:00 Release Payment (**Anomaly 5**: Payment released before receiving goods or invoice.) *   * Feb 09 12:00 Vendor Invoice Received (Invoice comes *after* payment. Hard to reconcile.) *   * Feb 10 13:00 Receive Goods (Goods arrive *after* payment.) *   * Feb 11 14:00 Match Invoice (Matching happens at the very end, after payment is gone.) *   * Feb 12 10:00 Close Case *   *Verdict:* \"Pre-payment\" without verification. High risk of paying for items that never show up or are incorrect. *   **Case 1004:** *   * Feb 05 10:00 Create PR *   * Feb 05 10:15 Approve PR *   * Feb 06 09:00 Receive Goods (**Anomaly 6**: Goods received *before* PO is issued.) *   * Feb 06 09:15 Issue Purchase Order (PO issued *after* goods receipt. You cant receive against a PO that doesnt exist yet.) *   * Feb 07 08:00 Vendor Invoice Received *   * Feb 07 08:30 Match Invoice *   * Feb 07 09:00 Release Payment *   * Feb 08 11:00 Close Case *   *Verdict:* \"Receipt before Order.\" This implies maverick buying or a very casual relationship where goods just show up, and the paperwork is done retroactively.

Doing it after the fact removes the gate. *   *Three-Way Match:* Matching ensures what was ordered (PO) is what was received (Goods) and what is billed (Invoice). Paying before this match means you might pay for the wrong quantity or price. *   *Financial Risk:* Paying before goods are received means the company might lose money if the vendor goes bankrupt or ships defective goods."

Also \"Release Payment\" (Feb 3) occurs before \"Receive Goods\" (Feb 4).

    "Text": "8.  **Final Polish:** Ensure clear headings and bullet points for readability. (Proceed to generate output based on these steps). *   *Self-Correction on Case 1002:* The prompt says \"Approve Purchase Requisition\" happens Feb 3. \"Issue Purchase Order\" happens Feb 1. Thats a clear control failure. Payment is Feb 3. Goods Receipt is Feb 4. Payment before goods is a massive risk. *   *Self-Correction on Case 1004:* Receive Goods at 09:00, Issue PO at 09:15. While they are on the same day, standard ERP systems require a PO number to enter a goods receipt. This suggests a manual workaround or backdating of documents. *   *Comparison:* Case 1001 is the reference model. Cases 1002, 1003, and 1004 are all anomalous. *   *Drafting the \"Why Problematic\" section:* *       **Bypassing Approval:** Committing funds (PO) without approval. *       **Early Payment (Case 1002 & 1003):** Paying before verification (Matching) and before physical receipt. If the vendor never ships, the money is gone. *       **Receipt before PO (Case 1004):** You cannot verify if the goods match the order if the order didnt exist when the goods arrived. Also implies unapproved spending. *   *Final Check of the log:* *       * 1002: Payment (07:15) -> Approval (08:00). This is effectively paying for an order that wasnt approved yet. *       * 1003: Payment (Feb 8) -> Goods (Feb 10). *       * 1004: Receive (09:00) -> PO (09:15). All looks consistent with my analysis. Ready to write."
