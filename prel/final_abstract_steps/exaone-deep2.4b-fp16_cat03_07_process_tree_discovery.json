    "Text": "Looking at the event log, I identified a repeating sequence where 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' is often followed by 'Validate Form (VF)', and this pattern can occur multiple times before proceeding to 'Approval Decision (AD)'. This suggests the presence of a loop structure in the process."

    "Text": "From cases 1, 2, and 3, I inferred that a loop structure is needed to accommodate the observed repetitions of 'RMI' before the mandatory step 'VF'. For example, case 3 exhibits two consecutive 'RMI' events followed by a single 'VF'. This hints that the loop allows any number of 'RMI' iterations."
