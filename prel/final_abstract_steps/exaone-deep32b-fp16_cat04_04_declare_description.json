But maybe theres another step in between. The AssembleLoanOfferPackage might come after gathering docs? Because assembling the package would require the documents. Looking at the respondedexistence entry, AssembleLoanOfferPackage has a target of QualityAssuranceReview. So after assembling, the QA review happens. Then the QA leads to Authorize. Then, perhaps after authorization, the funds can be transferred."

After that, the succession constraint takes us to GatherAdditionalDocuments. 4. Once documents are gathered, maybe the next step is AssembleLoanOfferPackage. But how is that triggered? The respondedexistences target is QA, so perhaps after assembling, the QA is done. So after gathering docs, you assemble the package, then QA, then authorize. 5. Then, after authorization, TransferFunds can happen. The chainresponse from Assemble might lead to Transfer, but maybe thats an alternative path? Or perhaps the main path is Authorize leads to Transfer via some constraint."
