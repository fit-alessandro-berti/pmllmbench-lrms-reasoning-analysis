    "Text": "Then come up with possible reasons The user wants hypotheses based on possible systemic issues automation bottlenecks etc Let me think about each anomaly and possible hypotheses Starting with R to P Receive to Approve The average is 25 hours with a low standard deviation This suggests that almost all claims take exactly 25 hours to get approved Thats unusual because real processes usually have some variation Maybe approvals are automated without human intervention or maybe theres a system error thats autoapproving claims immediately but that would have an average of zero Wait no 25 hours is about a day Maybe approvals are batched and processed at specific times leading to a tight schedule Hypotheses could be that approvals are batched daily or maybe certain claim types are autoapproved leading to little variation For P to N 7 days average with high STDEV 2 days So some claims take as little as 5 days and others up to 9 days Or maybe even more variation The inconsistency here might be due to manual processes where notifications are sent only on certain days or theres a backlog in the team responsible for notification Alternatively some adjusters might be slow or theres a dependency on external factors Hypotheses could be that notifications are handled manually and subject to delays or some regions have slower processes A to C Assign to Close in 2 hours If claims are being closed without going through Evaluate Approve Notify then thats a problem Maybe adjusters are closing claims too quickly perhaps due to high workload or incorrect procedures Or maybe some adjusters have permissions to bypass steps Hypotheses premature closures adjusters skipping steps or specific adjusters handling minor claims quickly E to N 5 minutes Evaluation to Notification Thats very fast Realistically after evaluating someone would need to process the approval and then notify If E is followed by N without P Approve then maybe approval is skipped Or maybe the system auto notifies upon evaluation but thats against the intended process Hypotheses skipping approval step automation errors or certain claim types that dont require approval"

    "Text": "Now for SQL queries The idea is to write queries that can find instances of these anomalies Lets take each anomaly For R to P Find claims where the time between R and P is within a certain range But how to calculate that Need to join the claim_events table for R and P events compute the difference then check against the average and STDEV Also considering the low STDEV maybe look for all R P pairs where the time is very close to 25h but perhaps the problem is that its too consistent Alternatively maybe the average is 25h but the actual values are all the same so variance is low But how to check that in SQL Maybe calculate the average and standard deviation for each pair and see if they match the model But the user wants queries to verify specific anomalies So for R P to find claims where the time between Receive and Approve is close to 25h with little variation Alternatively perhaps check for time differences in R P that are within a narrow window So a query that joins R and P events on claim_id calculates the time difference then filters those where the difference is between A V G minus S T D E V and A V G plus S T D E V but given that the S T D E V is very low Wait but the models S T D E V is low Maybe the hypothesis is that its too low so the data is too consistent So to verify find all R P times and see if their standard deviation is indeed low But the user might want specific queries that can identify individual claims that contribute to the anomaly Similarly for P to N Long average and high S T D E V So find claims where the time between P and N is more than average plus some multiple of S T D E V For example 7 days average 2 days S T D E V Claims taking longer than 9 days or less than 5 days might be outliers But high S T D E V suggests inconsistency so looking for both extremes For A to C Time between Assign and Close is less than say 3 hours average plus S T D E V but since average is 2h and S T D E V is 1h some claims are closed within 1h to 3h But the anomaly is that its too quick possibly skipping steps So the query should check if there are claims where Assign occurs and then Close without Evaluate or Approve in between So need to ensure that after Assign the next steps dont include E or P before C For E to N 5 minutes average So check if there are cases where Evaluation is immediately followed by Notify without an Approve in between So the path E to N without P"

    "Text": "Now how to structure the SQL queries First for each anomaly create a query that For R P anomaly Check for claims where the time between Receive and Approve has a very low variance But how to compute variance in SQL Maybe calculate the average and standard deviation of R P times But the user might want to find individual claims that contribute to the low S T D E V Alternatively the anomaly is that the average is high 25h but S T D E V is low So maybe the time between R and P is almost the same for all claims which could suggest automation So a query that finds all pairs of R and P events calculates the time difference and then shows their distribution But perhaps a query that calculates the average and standard deviation for R P SELECT AVG EXTRACT EPOCH FROM P timestamp minus R timestamp AS avg seconds STDDEV EXTRACT EPOCH FROM P timestamp minus R timestamp AS stddev seconds FROM claim events R JOIN claim events P ON R claim id equals P claim id WHERE R activity equals R AND P activity equals P If this returns a stddev close to 3600 1 hour then its confirmed But how does that help The user wants to verify anomalies So maybe the hypothesis is that some adjusters or claim types cause this So another query could group by claim type or adjuster But the prompt says to propose verification approaches using SQL queries So for each anomaly propose a query For R P Check for each claims R P time and filter those that have times within a narrow window eg between 24 and 26 hours to see if many claims fall into that range indicating automation SELECT claim id EXTRACT EPOCH FROM P timestamp minus R timestamp AS duration FROM claim events R JOIN claim events P ON R claim id equals P claim id WHERE R activity equals R AND P activity equals P AND P timestamp minus R timestamp BETWEEN INTERVAL 24 HOURS AND INTERVAL 26 HOURS If many rows are returned that supports the hypothesis of a fixed schedule To correlate with adjusters perhaps need to see which adjusters handled these claims But Assign activity A would link to adjuster via resource assuming resource is adjuster id or name Wait the resource column in claim events is V A R C H A R so it might be the name or I D of the adjuster when activity is Assign but for other activities maybe other resources So to find adjuster for a claim need to look at the Assign event So for example to find the adjuster involved in a claim SELECT ce claim id a adjuster id a name FROM claim events ce JOIN adjusters a ON ce resource equals a name OR ce resource equals a adjuster id V A R C H A R WHERE ce activity equals A But data types might vary Assuming resource could be adjuster id stored as string But this could be complicated Maybe the verification queries can just focus on the claim events table first For the P to N anomaly long average and high S T D E V We can find claims where the time between P and N is above 7 days plus 2 days high or below but maybe not necessary The inconsistency is the issue So SELECT claim id EXTRACT EPOCH FROM N timestamp minus P timestamp AS duration seconds FROM claim events P JOIN claim events N ON P claim id equals N claim id WHERE P activity equals P AND N activity equals N AND N timestamp minus P timestamp greater than INTERVAL 7 days But also check those that are shorter than average minus S T D E V eg less than 5 days But how to find extremes Alternatively calculate the average and stddev in the query to see SELECT AVG EXTRACT EPOCH FROM N timestamp minus P timestamp AS avg sec STDDEV EXTRACT EPOCH FROM N timestamp minus P timestamp AS stddev sec FROM claim events P JOIN claim events N ON P claim id equals N claim id WHERE P activity equals P AND N activity equals N If the stddev is high then the models data is confirmed But the user wants to verify anomalies Maybe group by region or adjuster For A to C anomaly Claims closed quickly after assignment Need to ensure that between A and C there are no E or P or N steps So find claims where the Assign event is followed by Close without the intermediate steps One approach For each claim check the sequence of activities For example find claims where the Assign A is followed by Close C and there are no E P N events in between Alternatively get all claims where the Close event occurs within 3 hours of Assign and check their event sequences A possible query SELECT A claim id A timestamp AS assign time C timestamp AS close time FROM claim events A JOIN claim events C ON A claim id equals C claim id WHERE A activity equals A AND C activity equals C AND C timestamp minus A timestamp less than or equal to INTERVAL 3 hours AND NOT EXISTS SELECT 1 FROM claim events middle WHERE middle claim id equals A claim id AND middle timestamp greater than A timestamp AND middle timestamp less than C timestamp AND middle activity IN E P N This would find claims that went from Assign to Close within 3 hours without any E P or N in between That would support the hypothesis that steps were skipped For the E to N anomaly 5 minutes average Need to check if theres an Evaluate followed by Notify without an Approve in between So SELECT E claim id E timestamp AS evaluate time N timestamp AS notify time FROM claim events E JOIN claim events N ON E claim id equals N claim id WHERE E activity equals E AND N activity equals N AND N timestamp minus E timestamp less than or equal to INTERVAL 5 minutes AND NOT EXISTS SELECT 1 FROM claim events P WHERE P claim id equals E claim id AND P activity equals P AND P timestamp greater than E timestamp AND P timestamp less than N timestamp This finds cases where Notify happened within 5 minutes of Evaluate without an Approve in between Now correlating with adjusters regions claim types For example to find if certain adjusters are responsible for the A to C quick closures SELECT A resource AS adjuster COUNT as num claims FROM claim events A JOIN claim events C ON A claim id equals C claim id WHERE A activity equals A AND C activity equals C AND C timestamp minus A timestamp less than or equal to INTERVAL 3 hours AND NOT EXISTS same as before GROUP BY A resource Or joining with adjusters table SELECT adj name COUNT as num quick closures FROM claim events A JOIN claim events C ON A claim id equals C claim id JOIN adjusters adj ON A resource equals adj name OR A resource integer equals adj adjuster id WHERE A activity equals A AND C activity equals C AND C timestamp minus A timestamp less than or equal to INTERVAL 3 hours AND NOT EXISTS GROUP BY adj name Similarly for claim types SELECT c claim type COUNT as num quick A to C FROM claim events A JOIN claim events C ON A claim id equals C claim id JOIN claims c ON A claim id equals c claim id WHERE A activity equals A AND C activity equals C AND C timestamp minus A timestamp less than or equal to INTERVAL 3 hours AND NOT EXISTS GROUP BY c claim type"
