The RMI modeled as a loop on RMI with: The loop operator * ( RMI, tau )... Wait, the loop operator requires that A first executed then choose to exit or do B and A again. So * ( A=RMI, B=tau) would require one RMI ( the first iteration's of A), then any number of repeats... Thus the loop * (RMI,. TAT) produce traces like: of RMI >=1."

    "Text": "Therefore, perhaps the key insight is that the RMI can be repeated any number of times, but followed by a single FF to exit that iteration? Alternatively, the model must allow multiple RMI per iteration, but with at least one per iteration. This requires the model to allow multiple RMI per iteration, thus the A part in the loop must allow multiple RMI followed by a VF. Thus, the A of the loop must be: A a sequence of (RMI repeated any numb er, followed by VF). To model the repeated RMIs: Use an inner loop of_ RMl... The RMI loop is * (A=RMI, B=Tea), this perm ans one or more Rl sls. Thus the A of the main loop is a SEQUENCE of: - inner loop ( [RMI*1 + )); - followed by VF... the main loop ( the A in the loop) is this sequence... main loop the RMI+ followed by VF, then choose to repest or exit... case3 IE3 trace would have: After AE, the-option2 path. The main loop is executed once, and within iteration, the inner lp allows two RMis + lock. Then exit. Thus the trace is: RMI1, RMI2, VF1 -> then exit the loop, proceeding to AD.. This fits 3 trace... the process tree would be structured as follows: - The tree is a sequence of: 1 . RA -> VF -> AE. 2. XOR between two paths: a ) Option1: to AD -> SC -> AC. b ) Option2: a sequence of: - the main loop (operator *), which has: children A B. A is the sequence of: - the inner loop (operator *): children a b: A_inner is RMI, B_I ner is tau. followed by VF (a leaf node). B of the main loop is tau. followed by AD -> SC -> AC. Thus the resulting process tree is complex with nested loops."
