First, the temporal profile is about capturing average time and standard deviation between activity pairs that eventually follow each other in process traces. The example shows pairs like (A,B) even if theyre not directly consecutive - so for a trace <A,B,C>, wed consider (A,B), (A,C), and (B,C)."

I need to generate a dictionary where keys are activity pairs (as tuples) and values are (avg_time, std_dev) in seconds. The challenge is estimating realistic time values for a high-tech electronics supply chain."

For instance: - Supplier selection (SS) to order placement (OP) might be quick (hours) since its administrative - But order placement (OP) to receiving components (RC) could take weeks depending on supplier location - Quality inspection (QI) after receiving (RC) might be 1-2 days - Assembly (CA) after inspection could be hours to days - Testing (PT) might be variable - could take days for thorough checks - Packaging (PK) and storage (WS) might be quick but storage duration depends on shipping schedules - Distribution (DT) varies by destination (local vs international) - After-sales (AS) happens long after shipment"

Immediate successors (core process flow) 2. Skip-one-step pairs (e.g., SS→RC) 3. Long-range pairs (e.g., SS→DT) 4. Include some high-variance cases (like international shipping) 5.
