    "Text": "First, the temporal profile is about capturing average time and standard deviation between activity pairs that eventually follow each other in process traces. The example shows pairs like (A,B) even if they're not directly consecutive - so for a trace <A,B,C>, we'd consider (A,B), (A,C), and (B,C)."

I need to generate a dictionary where keys are activity pairs (as tuples) and values are (avg_time, std_dev) in seconds. The challenge is estimating realistic time values for a high-tech electronics supply chain."

For instance: Supplier selection (SS) to order placement (OP) might be quick (hours) since it's administrative But order placement (OP) to receiving components (RC) could take weeks depending on supplier location Quality inspection (QI) after receiving (RC) might be 1-2 days Assembly (CA) after inspection could be hours to days Testing (PT) might be variable - could take days for thorough checks Packaging (PK) and storage (WS) might be quick but storage duration depends on shipping schedules Distribution (DT) varies by destination (local vs international) After-sales (AS) happens long after shipment"

Cumulative time: 14 + 0.5 + 0.2 = 14.7 days. Std dev should be higher since multiple steps (1270080, 300000 approx) (SS, DT): Entire chain from supplier selection to distribution. Could be 20+ days with high variance (1814400, 604800) After-sales (AS) is tricky - happens months later but might not be in every trace. Should include (DT, AS) with large avg/std dev."
