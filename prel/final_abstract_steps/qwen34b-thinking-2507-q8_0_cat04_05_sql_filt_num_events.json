First, the table is called event_log with columns case_id, activity, timestamp. Each case_id groups events for a process instance. The task is to get events from cases that have six or fewer events total. So, I need to count the number of events per case_id, then exclude those with count >6, and return the events."

So it's not just the counts, but the actual event rows."
