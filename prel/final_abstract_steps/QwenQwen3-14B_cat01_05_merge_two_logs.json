Maybe use a unified name, like Order Received with the note from Log B. Alternatively, keep both names but indicate the source. The problem says to merge corresponding events into unified records where possible. So perhaps use the more descriptive name or combine them. But the user didn't specify, so maybe just use the event type from Log A and include the event name from Log B as a note or additional attribute. Wait, the final output needs to have enriched attributes. So maybe include both event names, or pick one. The example in the problem's context says to include all attributes from both logs. So perhaps in the merged event, include both event types, or choose one as the primary. The user didn't specify, but the example in the problem might have merged them. For instance, in the first event, Log A says Order Received and Log B says OrderReceived (without space). Maybe use the one from Log A as the primary, and note the other. Or combine them. Since the user says to merge into unified records, perhaps use a common name. Alternatively, keep both. The problem says to include all attributes, so maybe include both event names as separate fields. However, the example output in the problem might not have that, but the user hasn't provided an example. Let me think. The final output should present events in chronological order. So perhaps the event type from Log A is the primary, and the event name from Log B is an additional attribute. Or maybe use a standardized name. Since the user says merge corresponding events into unified records where possible, perhaps the event type from Log A is the main one, and the event name from Log B is included as an attribute. But the problem says to include all attributes. So perhaps in the merged event, include both event_type (from Log A) and event_name (from Log B), along with the other attributes. However, the user might prefer a single event type. Alternatively, maybe the event names are considered different but represent the same activity. For example, Order Received vs OrderReceived are the same. So maybe use the one from Log A as the event type, and include the event name from Log B as a note. But the problem says to include all attributes, so perhaps include both. However, the final output format isn't specified. The user says to produce a merged event log with enriched attributes. So perhaps in the merged event, include both event_type and event_name, along with the other attributes. But since the user didn't specify, maybe just use the event_type from Log A and include the event_name from Log B as a note. Alternatively, standardize the names. Let me check the problem statement again."
