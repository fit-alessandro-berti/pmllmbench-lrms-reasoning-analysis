    "Text": "Starting with C001. The first activity is Initiate Request. Then, when the agent checks documents, thats Verify Documents. But then theres a Call Customer with incomplete docs. Wait, so the initial process might be: customer submits, agent checks, then they call for more info. Then they submit the scan, which leads to another Verify. Then they submit something else, maybe adjust the account? Wait, in C001, the activity Submit Additional is mentioned, but the next activity after that is Verify Documents again. So maybe the process is: submit the scan, then re-check documents. Then they proceed to adjust the account? Wait, in C001, theres an adjustment after the submit. So maybe the process is: submit scan, verify documents recheck, then adjust account submit additional, then verify again."

    "Text": "But in C001, the activity Submit Additional happens, but then the next activity is Verify Documents again. So maybe Submit Additional is a step where they upload the scan, which leads to Verify Documents again. Then they adjust the account, leading to Verify Documents again. So perhaps the activity Submit Additional is renaming to something like Upload Scan to indicate uploading the scanned document. Then Verify Documents is reusing the same name but with context. But in C001, they have two instances of Verify Documents: once after the scan submission and once after the adjustment. So maybe Verify Documents is renaming to DoubleVerify to show that its a two step process."

The first activity is Initiate Request again, then Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, etc. So maybe Call Customer can be renamed to FollowUp Call to show that its a step after the initial call. Then Adjust Account could be renamed to Internal Correction to indicate that its an internal step."
