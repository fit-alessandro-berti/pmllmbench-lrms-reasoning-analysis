Case 105 is the slowest. Escalation seems correlated with higher duration. * **Pattern 2: Overnight/Day Boundaries.** Cases 102, 104, and 105 all span multiple days. Specifically, there is a gap between afternoon activities and resolution the next morning. This suggests work isnt happening outside business hours or theres a handover delay. * **Pattern 3: Pre-Investigation Wait.** Case 104 has a long wait between Assign and Investigate (3.5 hours). Case 102 has a wait between Assign and Escalate (2.5 hours). * **Pattern 4: Post-Investigation Wait.** Cases 102, 104, and 105 all have a long gap between the final Investigate and Resolve."

    "Text": "4. **Drafting the Analysis (Task 3):** * *Root Causes:* 1. **Escalation Handover Latency:** When a ticket goes to Level-2, there is a significant delay before they pick it up (e.g., Case 105: Escalated Day 1 10:00, Investigated Day 2 14:00). 2. **End-of-Day Handover:** Tickets investigated late in the day are not resolved until the next morning. This implies a batching of resolutions or lack of capacity to close tickets same-day if they get complex. 3. **Initial Assignment Lag:** Some agents take time to start investigating after assignment (Case 104). * *Recommendations:* 1. Improve Level-2 SLA (Service Level Agreement). 2. Encourage same-day resolution for tickets investigated before a certain cutoff time. 3. Monitor Assign to Investigate time for Level-1 agents."

    "Text": "5. **Refining the Output:** * Structure the response clearly according to the three tasks. * Use calculated metrics (hours/minutes) to support claims. * Ensure the tone is analytical and professional. * *Self-Correction on Case 104:* Case 104 does *not* show an Escalate activity, yet it takes 24 hours. Why? The gap is between Investigate Issue (Day 1 13:00) and Resolve Ticket (Day 2 08:00). This suggests the agent found the solution but didnt close it until the next day, or the investigation was paused. Wait, looking closely at 104: Assign 09:30 -> Investigate 13:00 (3.5h wait). Investigate 13:00 -> Resolve 08:00 next day (19h wait). This looks like an agent workload issue or a parked ticket. * *Self-Correction on Case 105:* Escalate 10:00 Day 1 -> Investigate 14:00 Day 2. That is a 28-hour gap just waiting for Level-2. This is the biggest bottleneck."

Yes (Escalation delays, End-of-Day boundaries, Initial lag). * Explain factors & recommendations? Yes. *Calculation Check:* * 101: 08:00 to 10:15 = 2h 15m. * 102: 08:05 Day 1 to 09:15 Day 2 = 25h 10m. * 103: 08:10 to 09:30 = 1h 20m. * 104: 08:20 Day 1 to 08:30 Day 2 = 24h 10m. * 105: 08:25 Day 1 to 09:30 Day 3 = 49h 5m. *Average of fast cases:* ~1h 47m. *Average of slow cases:* ~32h. *Significant difference confirmed.*"
