If the hiring process is biased towards Group B, that could mean that candidates from Group A are not being considered, which might be unfair. Alternatively, if the adjustments in Group B are based on local business, but in Group A, theres no such adjustment, then the bias is that the hiring process doesnt consider the pros of Group As candidates."
