One branch is the standard cultural fit check, and the other is the CommunityAffiliationCheck which gives an advantage. So in POWL terms, after the SkillAssessment, there's an XOR operator choosing between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck. The CommunityAffiliationCheck would then influence the evaluation, leading to a bias."

So when B is executed, it goes to C, then back to B, etc. Once data is complete (i.e., after B is done and no more requests), it proceeds to D. Yes, that makes sense.
