    "Text": "We need to produce Python code constructing the Petri net. Use pm4py library. Provide places and transitions, arcs, initial and final marking. Should include loops between DV and RDS, FC and II. Also include optional approval step if amount > threshold; but we can model as a transition that may or may not be taken? We can just have a transition AP that is optional: maybe use two branches: one path goes through AP, another bypasses it? But scenario says must be approved by senior manager if amount surpasses threshold. So we could model as a decision place after CA where token goes to either AP or directly to P depending on condition. But for simplicity we can just include AP always; its fine."

Similarly for FC/II loop: place fraud_check before FC; II leads back to fraud_check. After CA -> maybe place assessment_done. Then optionally go through AP -> payment -> notification -> closure."

CR -> after_CR. after_CR -> DV. DV -> doc_verification? Actually we need a place before DV: lets call p_doc_verif_start. So start->CR->p_doc_start->DV->p_doc_end.

Transition RDS consumes from p3, produces into p2 (loop). Similarly for fraud check: Place p4 = fraud_check_start Place p5 = after_FC Transition FC consumes from p4 produce into p5. Transition II consumes from p5 produce into p4. After that go to CA: Place after_CA Transitions accordingly."

    "Text": "Then optional approval: Place pre_AP If amount > threshold then token goes through AP else skip? For simplicity just add both branches using places with AND-split/merge? Could use two places: one branch with AP, other without but both converge at payment. Use an OR-split by having two arcs from pre_AP to both AP transition and directly to payment transition with guard conditions omitted in Petri net representation but conceptually there is choice. Simplify: After CA produce token in pre_AP_place which has two outgoing arcs: one arc leads via AP transition then payment; another arc leads directly via payment transition skipping approval. approval path but still includes possibility of going through approval if needed. Thus define transitions: t_AP labeled Approval t_Payment labeled Payment Arcs: pre_AP_place --(AP)--> post_AP_place --(Payment)--> ... pre_AP_place --(Payment)--> ...  # direct path But easier: create two places post_CA1 and post_CA2 representing the two branches merging at Payment stage using an AND-split/merge? Actually OR-split would be represented by having multiple outgoing arcs from same place leading to different transitions; thats fine because Petri nets allow nondeterministic choice based on tokens distribution - but here only one token so it will nondeterministically choose one branch unless there are conditions encoded elsewhere like inhibitor arcs etc., which pm4py might not support easily. But its okay for demonstration purposes. Thus implement as described above with simple structure ignoring conditional gating details beyond loops."

For loops use appropriate connections backwards accordingly. Set initial marking im[place_start] = 1 Set final marking fm[place_closure] = 1 Return net im fm maybe print something?
