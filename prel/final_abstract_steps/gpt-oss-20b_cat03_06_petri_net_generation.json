We can just have a transition AP that is optional: maybe use two branches: one path goes through AP, another bypasses it? But scenario says must be approved by senior manager if amount surpasses threshold. So we could model as a decision place after CA where token goes to either AP or directly to P depending on condition. But for simplicity we can just include AP always; it's fine."

Then from p_doc_end we go either to next step or back via RDS. Let's design: Place p1 = 'after_CR' Place p2 = 'doc_verif' Place p3 = 'after_DV'  # ready for next step. Transition DV consumes from p2, produces into p3. Transition RDS consumes from p3, produces into p2 (loop). Similarly for fraud check: Place p4 = 'fraud_check_start' Place p5 = 'after_FC'. Transition FC consumes from p4 produce into p5. Transition II consumes from p5 produce into p4."

    "Text": "Then optional approval: Place pre_AP If amount > threshold then token goes through AP else skip? For simplicity just add both branches using places with AND-split/merge? Could use two places: one branch with AP, other without but both converge at Payment stage using an AND-split/merge? Actually OR-split would be represented by having multiple outgoing arcs from same place leading to different transitions; that's fine because Petri nets allow nondeterministic choice based on tokens distribution - but here only one token so it will nondeterministically choose one branch unless there are conditions encoded elsewhere like inhibitor arcs etc., which pm4py might not support easily. But it's okay for demonstration purposes."
