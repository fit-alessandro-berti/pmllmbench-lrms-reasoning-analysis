    "Text": "Starting with Verify Documents: In Case C001, it occurs twice. The first time, the BackOfficeAgent checks identity documents but finds something missing, leading to a call. The second time, after the customer submits additional docs, they re-check. So the context here is initial verification vs. re-verification after additional info. Renaming these to Initial Document Verification and Additional Document Verification makes sense."

    "Text": "Next, Call Customer in C001 is a call to request missing documents, while in C002, the first call is to clarify an account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. Similarly, in C003, the call is to ask the customer to return. So each call has a different purpose: requesting info, clarifying details, follow-up confirmation, and recalling customer. Renaming these based on the purpose would disambiguate them."
