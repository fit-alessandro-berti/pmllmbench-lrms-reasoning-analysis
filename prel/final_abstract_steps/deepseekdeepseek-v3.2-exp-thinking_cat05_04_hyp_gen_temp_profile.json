    "Text": "We are given a temporal profile model that shows average times and standard deviations between pairs of activities. We note the following anomalies: 1. (R, P): Average ~25 hours (90000 seconds) with a very low standard deviation (3600 seconds, i.e., 1 hour). This is suspicious because the steps between R and P typically include A (Assign) and E (Evaluate), which would normally introduce more variability. 2. (P, N): Average 7 days (604800 seconds) with a high standard deviation (2 days, 172800 seconds). This is a long delay and also inconsistent. 3. (A, C): Average 2 hours (7200 seconds) with standard deviation 1 hour (3600 seconds). This is quick and might indicate that some claims are closed without going through the usual steps. 4. (E, N): Average 5 minutes (300 seconds) with standard deviation 1 minute (60 seconds). This is very quick and might indicate an automatic step or skipping of the approval step."

    "Text": "Hypotheses: 1. For (R, P) with low standard deviation: Hypothesis: There might be an automated system that schedules approvals at a fixed time after receipt, regardless of the actual evaluation. 2. For (P, N) with long and variable delay: Hypothesis: The notification step might be manual and subject to backlog, or there might be a dependency on external factors (like waiting for a check to be printed) that causes variable delays. 3. For (A, C) being too quick: Hypothesis: Some claims might be automatically closed without evaluation, for example, because they are below a threshold or duplicates. 4. For (E, N) being too quick: Hypothesis: The system might be automatically notifying the customer immediately after evaluation, but without the required approval step, or the approval step might be skipped in some cases."

    "Text": "We will use the claim_events table to compute the actual times between activities for each claim and then compare against the temporal profile. Note: We assume that for a given claim, each activity occurs at most once. If an activity occurs multiple times, we take the first occurrence? But the process is linear? Well assume we take the minimum timestamp for each activity per claim. Well create a query that for each claim, collects the timestamps for each activity. Then we can compute the differences. However, note that the process might not have every step. We are particularly interested in the steps that are present and the order. Lets define a common table expression (CTE) to get the first timestamp of each activity for each claim. Then, we can compute the time differences between activities. We are going to focus on the following pairs: (R, P), (P, N), (A, C), (E, N). We can also check if the steps in between are missing."

    "Text": "Proposed Queries: 1. Check for claims that have both R and P and compute the time difference. Then, see if the time difference is within the expected range (say, within 2 standard deviations from the mean). But note the anomaly: the standard deviation is low, so we might look for claims that are outside the expected range? Actually, the anomaly is that the standard deviation is low, so we might want to check if indeed the time from R to P is consistently around 25 hours. We can compute the average and standard deviation of (P_time - R_time) for claims that have both events and see if it matches the model. Alternatively, we can check if there are claims that deviate significantly. Query 1: Check R to P time WITH claim_activities AS ( SELECT claim_id, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = R THEN timestamp END) AS R_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) AS P_time FROM claim_events GROUP BY claim_id ) SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (P_time - R_time)) AS diff_seconds FROM claim_activities WHERE R_time IS NOT NULL AND P_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY diff_seconds; We can then compute the average and standard deviation of diff_seconds and compare with the model. Alternatively, to find outliers, we can use: SELECT claim_id, diff_seconds FROM ( SELECT claim_id, diff_seconds, (diff_seconds - 90000) / 3600 AS z_score FROM ... ) AS t WHERE ABS(z_score) > 2; But note: the model says (90000, 3600) so we can check if the data indeed has a low standard deviation. Query 2: Check P to N time Similarly, WITH claim_activities AS ( SELECT claim_id, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) AS P_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = N THEN timestamp END) AS N_time FROM claim_events GROUP BY claim_id ) SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (N_time - P_time)) AS diff_seconds FROM claim_activities WHERE P_time IS NOT NULL AND N_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY diff_seconds; We expect some claims with very long delays and some with short, and overall high variability. Query 3: Check A to C time and whether intermediate steps are missing We can check for claims that have A and C but missing E and P? Or if the time from A to C is very short, then check if the intermediate steps are missing. WITH claim_activities AS ( SELECT claim_id, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = A THEN timestamp END) AS A_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = E THEN timestamp END) AS E_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) AS P_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = C THEN timestamp END) AS C_time FROM claim_events GROUP BY claim_id ) SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (C_time - A_time)) AS diff_seconds, CASE WHEN E_time IS NULL THEN Missing E WHEN P_time IS NULL THEN Missing P ELSE Has E and P END AS intermediate_steps FROM claim_activities WHERE A_time IS NOT NULL AND C_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY diff_seconds; We are interested in the ones with very short diff_seconds and especially those missing E and P. Query 4: Check E to N time and whether P is present WITH claim_activities AS ( SELECT claim_id, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = E THEN timestamp END) AS E_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) AS P_time, MIN(CASE WHEN activity = N THEN timestamp END) AS N_time FROM claim_events GROUP BY claim_id ) SELECT claim_id, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (N_time - E_time)) AS diff_seconds, P_time IS NOT NULL AS has_approval FROM claim_activities WHERE E_time IS NOT NULL AND N_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY diff_seconds; We are interested in the ones with very short diff_seconds and especially those without an approval (P) step. Additional: We can also check if the anomalies are correlated with specific adjusters, claim types, or regions. For example, for the quick A to C, we can join with the claims and adjusters tables (if the resource in claim_events is the adjuster_id, or we have adjuster information in the claim_events table? The claim_events table has a resource column, which might be the adjuster_id? We dont have a direct link in the given schema, but we can assume that the resource in claim_events can be linked to adjusters.adjuster_id (either as a string or integer). We can try to cast if necessary. Lets adjust Query 3 to include the adjuster and claim type: WITH claim_activities AS ( SELECT ce.claim_id, MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = A THEN ce.timestamp END) AS A_time, MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = E THEN ce.timestamp END) AS E_time, MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = P THEN ce.timestamp END) AS P_time, MIN(CASE WHEN ce.activity = C THEN ce.timestamp END) AS C_time, Get the resource from the A activity MAX(CASE WHEN ce.activity = A THEN ce.resource END) AS adjuster_resource FROM claim_events ce GROUP BY ce.claim_id ) SELECT ca.claim_id, c.claim_type, a.adjuster_id, a.name AS adjuster_name, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ca.C_time - ca.A_time)) AS diff_seconds, CASE WHEN ca.E_time IS NULL THEN Missing E WHEN ca.P_time IS NULL THEN Missing P ELSE Has E and P END AS intermediate_steps FROM claim_activities ca JOIN claims c ON ca.claim_id = c.claim_id LEFT JOIN adjusters a ON ca.adjuster_resource = a.adjuster_id::VARCHAR assuming resource is stored as string of adjuster_id WHERE ca.A_time IS NOT NULL AND ca.C_time IS NOT NULL ORDER BY diff_seconds; Similarly, we can adjust other queries to include additional context. We can also check for regional patterns by joining with the adjusters table and then grouping by region. Lets write the queries accordingly."
