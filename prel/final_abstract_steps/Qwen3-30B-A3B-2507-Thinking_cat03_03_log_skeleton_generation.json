It should be: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity must be executed after the first. always_before: for a pair (A, B), it means B must be before A. always_after: for a pair (A, B), it means A must be before B. We'll use always_after for the natural order: we want RO before CA, so we put (RO, CA) in always_after."
