Model2s anomaly: After Posting, you can choose between immediate Screening (Screen) and Conducting Interviews (Interview). But if you go for Interview first without subsequent steps leading to Decision, the process is incomplete. Moreover, in model2s loop structure with loop_onboarding and xor_payroll, once youre at Decide node, you enter a loop where Onboard or skip can be taken repeatedly until choosing Payroll again via XOR.

Model2 allows either immediate Screening or Interview after Posting, which might bypass necessary screening steps. Additionally, its use of loops to handle onboarding and payroll could lead to indefinite looping without making a clear hiring decision unless forced through XOR_payroll again."

The anomaly of letting the case slip through without proper progression (if Interview is chosen) might be considered severe in terms of not handling all cases correctly. But since both models allow deviations from the standard sequence, perhaps the answer hinges on which models anomalies are less critical."
