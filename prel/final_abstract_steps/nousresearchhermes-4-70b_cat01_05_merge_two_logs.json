We'll choose Log A's timestamp as the primary for ordering and display, but store Log B's in a separate attribute? ... So we can use the Log A timestamp as primary and then also store the Log B timestamp as an additional attribute. ... For merged events, we will combine all attributes. ... The requirement is to leave them separate if not matched. So we will have one event for Quality Check that only comes from Log B. ... We will create a merged log with the following columns ... The requirement says include all attributes from both logs. So we can have: event_type_A: the event type from Log A (if exists) event_type_B: the event type from Log B (if exists) ... We will also note the source of the event: e.g., if it was only in Log A, then source = A, if only Log B, then B, if both, then A and B. ... We can do: System A, System B, or Both."

For each event in Log A: find the event in Log B that is closest in time (within 2 seconds) and same order_id. If found, then merge. ...

    "Text": "the requirement says if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them the same event. So we do strictly less. However, let's see: the next event in Log A is at 10:01:30 and the next in Log B is at 10:01:29 (only 1 second apart) -> that would match. For the first event, they are 2 seconds apart -> we do not match? That seems counterintuitive? We might want to allow <= 2? The requirement says e.g. meaning example, so we can use <= 2? Or we can use a tolerance of 2 seconds (inclusive)? ... We'll set tolerance to 2 seconds (inclusive). So we do: if abs(timeA - timeB) <= timedelta(seconds=2)"
