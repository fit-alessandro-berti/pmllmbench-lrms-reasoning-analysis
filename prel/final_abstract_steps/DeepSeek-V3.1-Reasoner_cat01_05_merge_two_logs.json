The event names are similar: Order Received vs OrderReceived. So, I think these represent the same event. I'll merge them. Similarly, second event: Log A has Order Validated at 10:01:30Z. Log B has OrderValidation at 10:01:29Z, which is 1 second earlier. Within tolerance. Event names match conceptually. So, same event."

The requirement says: if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them the same event. Here, difference is 5 seconds, which is more than 2 seconds.

The prompt says: If timestamps differ slightly, you can select one as primary or include both. I think for consistency, I should include both timestamps in the merged log, so that we have the data from both systems."

Therefore, for merged events, I should use the Log B timestamp for ordering because it might be more accurate."

Now, for the chronological order, based on timestamp: 1. timestamp: 09:59:58Z - event: Order Received... 7. timestamp: 10:20:00Z - event: Item Delivered. This seems logical."
