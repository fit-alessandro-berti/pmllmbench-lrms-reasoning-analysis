So equivalence between RO and IC (same occurrences). Also maybe between Generate Shipping Label and Dispatch (one each). Also between Reserve Items and Pick Items? Usually each order reserves items once and picks once. So equivalence between RI and PI. Also between Pack Order and Generate Shipping Label? Might be same count. Could include multiple equivalences."

    "Text": "Always_after: If first occurs, second occurs later. This is similar to always_before but reversed direction. Could include constraints like (CA, RO) always after? Actually always_after means if first occurs, second occurs later. So we can list pairs where second must happen after first. Could be same as always_before but reversed: e.g., (CA, RO) as always_after? Wait definition: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. Means second occurs after first. So we can list (RO, CA) as always_before, and (CA, RO) as always_after? That would be contradictory. Actually always_before: first must be before second. always_after: first must be after second. So we need constraints where first occurs after second. For example, Payment Record (RP) must occur after Invoice Customer (IC). So (RP, IC) always after. Also QC after PI? Actually QC after PI, so (QC, PI) always after. Similarly D after GSL, etc."
