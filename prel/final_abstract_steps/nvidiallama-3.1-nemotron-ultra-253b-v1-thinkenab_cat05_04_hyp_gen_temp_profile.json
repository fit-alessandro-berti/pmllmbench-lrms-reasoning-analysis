    "Text": "Starting with the anomalies listed in the model 1 R to P The average time is around 25 hours with a very low standard deviation A low STDEV here suggests that the approval happens almost exactly 25 hours after receiving which is too consistent Real processes usually have more variability unless automated but even automation might not explain such a rigid timeline especially if there are supposed steps like Assignment and Evaluation in between 2 P to N The average delay is 7 days with a high STDEV A week long delay seems excessive for a notification after approval The high STDEV means some notifications happen quickly while others take much longer This inconsistency could indicate resource issues or bottlenecks 3 A to C On average it takes 2 hours from Assign to Close But according to the intended process after Assign comes Evaluate Approve Notify then Close Closing so quickly after Assignment skips these steps suggesting some claims are being closed prematurely maybe incorrectly 4 E to N Only 5 minutes on average Normally after Evaluation there should be Approval before Notification A 5 minute jump from Evaluation to Notification might mean Approval is skipped or happens instantly which could be a system error or a workaround"
