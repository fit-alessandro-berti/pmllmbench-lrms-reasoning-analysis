    "Text": "Looking at events 1-3: The temperature is around 20°C, pressure is 1 bar, vibration is 0, material flow is 0, tool position is 0, and energy consumption is around 0.4-0.5 kWh. These seem like baseline or idle states because all the readings are low. Maybe the machine is starting up or preparing to begin an activity."

    "Text": "Event 4: Temperature jumps to 50°C, pressure stays at 1 bar, vibration increases to 30 Hz, material flow is 5 units/s, tool position moves to 5 mm, and energy usage goes up to 2.00 kWh. This looks like a significant change. Higher temperature and vibration might indicate the machine is performing a cutting operation."

    "Text": "Events 5-6: Temperature increases further to 55 and 58°C, pressure goes up slightly to 1.5 bar, vibration increases to 35 and 38 Hz, material flow remains at 5, tool position moves to 7 and 10 mm, and energy continues to rise to 2.50 and 3.00 kWh. This seems like the cutting operation is in progress, possibly becoming more intense as the tool moves closer."

This high temperature and vibration, combined with high energy usage, suggests a welding operation."

This cooldown period after welding makes sense. The machine is probably finishing up the welding and preparing for the next step, which could be quality inspection."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 13-15: Similar to the initial events, with low temperature, pressure, vibration, and material flow, and tool position back to 0. This looks like the machine is returning to idle, maybe after completing the inspection and preparing for the next cycle."
