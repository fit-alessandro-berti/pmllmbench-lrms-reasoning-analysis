    "Text": "The first step is to analyze the event log for CaseID A1 to identify recurring sequences and logical connections between events. I can see a clear temporal order. The activities for Case A1 and Case B2 follow the same sequence, indicating a standardized process."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "I will hypothesize logical groupings based on semantics, resources, and temporal proximity. The initial events (Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat) all seem to serve the purpose of preparation. They occur in a tight time window at the very beginning."

    "Text": "A second group appears around the welding activities. Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, and Weld corner B are all performed by Operator B and constitute the core assembly task."

    "Text": "From these hypotheses, I can deduce a three-stage process model. Stage 1 is Material Preparation, Stage 2 is Assembly, and Stage 3 is Finishing and Inspection. This model simplifies the dozen low-level events into three understandable phases, which aligns with the goal of the task."
