    "Text": "The presence of the Community Boost in Group B s process introduces a disparity Since Group A applicants arent part of any CommunityGroup they cant benefit from such adjustments This could be due to the design of the system where certain groups have access to boosting factors that others dont leading to unequal treatment In summary the bias is against Group A Protected Group because they are not afforded the same opportunities for score adjustments or special considerations that Group B Unprotected Group receives through their CommunityGroup membership"
