Lets go through each case. Case 101: Received at 08:00, closed at 10:15. Thats 2 hours and 15 minutes. Case 102: Received on March 1 at 08:05, closed on March 2 at 09:15. Thats over a dayaround 25 hours and 10 minutes. Case 103: From 08:10 to 09:30 same day1 hour and 20 minutes. Case 104: Received March 1 at 08:20, closed March 2 at 08:30. Thats about 24 hours and 10 minutes. Case 105: Starts March 1 at 08:25, ends March 3 at 09:30. So over two daysaround 49 hours and 5 minutes."

    "Text": "Moving to task 2: Find root causes. Lets check the logs for these cases. Case 102 had an escalation to Level-2 Agent after being assigned to Level-1. Theres a gap between escalation (11:30) and next activity (14:00 same day), which is a few hours. Then after investigation, resolution happens the next day. So delays might be due to handover time between levels and possible backlog in Level-2. Case 104 shows a long time between Assign to Level-1 (09:30) and Investigate Issue (13:00)3.5 hours. Then from investigation to resolution next dayovernight delay. Maybe the agent didnt start investigating promptly or had other priorities. Case 105 was escalated to Level-2 on March 1 at 10:00, but the next investigation is March 2 at 14:00over a day later. Then another day before resolution. This suggests significant delays post-escalation, possibly due to high workload in Level-2 or lack of prioritization."

    "Text": "Common factors here are escalations leading to delays, waiting times between activities (like triage to assignment or assignment to investigation), and possible inefficiencies in handling escalated tickets. Also, some cases span multiple days, indicating that tickets arent resolved within the same business day when escalated."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "For task 3: Explain how these factors increase cycle times and propose solutions. Escalations add steps and transfer time between teams. If Level-2 is busy, tickets sit idle. Long waiting times between activities might indicate poor resource allocation or prioritization. Overnight delays could mean no follow-up until next business day. Recommendations could include: 1. Improve escalation protocols to ensure quicker handoffs. 2. Monitor and reduce idle times between activities by setting SLAs for each step. 3. Provide more training to Level-1 agents to handle complex issues without escalation. 4. Implement shift coverage to handle tickets that span days. 5. Use automation or better triage to route tickets more effectively initially."
