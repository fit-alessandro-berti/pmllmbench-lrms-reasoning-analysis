We are to consider the set of activities: ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS'] And we are to create a dictionary that includes pairs of these activities. We are to make it representative and complex: meaning we should include pairs that are adjacent and non-adjacent? But without actual data, we cannot compute the averages and standard deviations. Therefore, the problem must be to design a function that, given a set of traces (each trace is a list of activity labels), computes the temporal profile? But the problem says: construct a dictionary, meaning we are to output a dictionary? And the example output is a dictionary with keys being tuples of two activity labels and values being a tuple (average_time, standard_deviation). Without data, we cannot do that. However, note: the problem says Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt meaning that we are not to hardcode numbers? But then what? I think there is a misunderstanding. The problem is to model the temporal profile as a dictionary, but we are to assume that we have the raw traces?

    "Text": "We will create an example that includes: Pairs of activities that are adjacent in the supply chain: ('SS', 'OP'): (86400, 3600)   # average time and std dev for SS to OP ('OP', 'RC'): (43200, 7200) ('RC', 'QI'): (28800, 2400) ('QI', 'CA'): (14400, 1200) ('CA', 'PT'): (7200, 600) ('PT', 'PK'): (3600, 3600) ('PK', 'WS'): (3600, 3600) ('WS', 'DT'): (3600, 3600) ('DT', 'AS'): (14400, 1200) And then we also include some non-adjacent pairs to ensure complexity: ('SS', 'RC'): (129600, 10800)   # SS to RC: SS->OP + OP->RC ('SS', 'QI'): (144000, 12000)   # SS->OP->RC->QI ('OP', 'CA'): (64800, 5400)     # OP->RC->QI->CA ('RC', 'PT'): (43200, 3600)     # RC->QI->CA->PT ('QI', 'WS'): (10800, 900)      # QI->CA->PT->PK->WS: but we only have up to PK in the adjacent? So we break it down? But note: we don't have an activity 'WS' after 'PK' in the adjacent list? We have ('PK','WS'). However, for non-adjacent pairs, we can take the sum of the adjacent times? But the problem says: the time between two activities is the total time from the first to the second? Therefore, we can compute non-adjacent pairs as the sum of the adjacent times? But then the average and std dev for non-adjacent pairs would be the sum of the averages and the sum of the std devs? However, the standard deviation is not additive. For independent steps, the variance is additive. But the steps are sequential and not independent? But for the purpose of this example, we can assume that the time from X to Y is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments? Then: average_time(X, Y) = sum( average_time(X, Z) + average_time(Z, Y) ) for every consecutive pair from X to Y? std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( sum( std_dev(X, Z)^2 + std_dev(Z, Y)^2 ) )? But note: the standard deviation of the sum of independent random variables is the square root of the sum of variances. However, the times might not be independent. But we don't have data to compute the variance for non-adjacent pairs. Therefore, we will only include adjacent pairs in the example? But the problem says not only directly connected, but eventually following each other. So we must include non-adjacent pairs? How about we only include adjacent pairs? The example in the problem does not show non-adjacent pairs? Actually, the example in the problem says: for trace <A,B,C,D> they consider every pair (i,j) with i<j. Therefore, we must include non-adjacent pairs? Without data, we can only hardcode the values? Given the constraints, I will create a fictional temporal profile that includes non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent times and then adding some random variation? But that would be arbitrary. Alternatively, we can assume that the non-adjacent pairs are not present in the data? Then we don't include them? But the problem says ensuring complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps. Therefore, we must include them. I will create a representative set of non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent segments and then adding a fixed variation? For example, for the pair (X, Y) that are two steps apart: average_time(X, Y) = average_time(X, Z) + average_time(Z, Y) + epsilon std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( std_dev(X, Z)^2 + std_dev(Z, Y)^2 )   # ignoring epsilon for simplicity But then we are not really measuring the variation of the entire path. Given the ambiguity, I will generate a fictional temporal profile for the supply chain activities including both adjacent and non-adjacent pairs. We will create: Adjacent pairs (as above) and then non-adjacent pairs by taking the sum of the adjacent times and then adding some random variation? But the problem does not require random variation. It requires an estimated average and standard deviation. How about we assume that the time for a non-adjacent pair is the sum of the times of the consecutive adjacent pairs? And then we set the standard deviation to be the square root of the sum of the squares of the stddevs of the consecutive segments? This is the standard deviation for the sum of independent random variables. However, the activities are sequential and not independent. But we don't have data to argue otherwise. Steps for non-adjacent pairs: Let P0 = SS, P1, P2, ..., Pn = DT (for example) For a non-adjacent pair (P0, P2): time0 = time(P0, P1) + time(P1, P2) average_time(P0, P2) = average_time(P0, P1) + average_time(P1, P2) std_dev(P0, P2) = sqrt( std_dev(P0, P1)**2 + std_dev(P1, P2)**2 ) Similarly for (P0, P3): time0 = time(P0, P1) + time(P1, P2) + time(P2, P3) average_time(P0, P3) = average_time(P0, P1) + average_time(P1, P2) + average_time(P2, P3) std_dev(P0, P3) = sqrt( std_dev(P0, P1)**2 + std_dev(P1, P2)**2 + std_dev(P2, P3)**2 ) But note: the example activity sequence: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS We don't have an activity after AS? So we won't consider pairs that go beyond AS? We'll consider pairs within the sequence. We'll create the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the set and X != Y, and we have a path from X to Y in the supply chain sequence? But note: the supply chain sequence is fixed. So every activity has a fixed order? Therefore, we can compute the non-adjacent pairs by summing the adjacent ones. However, the problem does not say that the activities are in a fixed sequence without branching? Given the complexity, I will create the temporal profile for the entire set of activities by including every pair (X, Y) that appears in the same trace? But without data, we cannot compute the average and std dev. Therefore, I will create a fictional temporal profile that includes: For every activity and every activity that comes before it in the supply chain sequence (i.e., the fixed order), we compute the time as the sum of the adjacent times from the first to the last. But note: the activities are not necessarily visited in the fixed order in every trace? The problem says: the global supply chain process and the activities are listed in a fixed order. But in a trace, the activities might not appear in that order? The problem does not specify. Given the ambiguity, I will assume that every trace is the fixed order: ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS'] Then for any two activities (X, Y), if X appears before Y in the fixed order, then the time between X and Y is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments from X to Y. And if there are multiple occurrences, then we aggregate over every occurrence? But the fixed order trace has each activity once. Therefore, for every pair (X, Y) with X before Y in the fixed order, we have one time: the sum of the adjacent times from X to Y. Then the average and std dev for the pair (X, Y) is that single time and zero std dev? But then the std dev would be zero? That is not very representative. Alternatively, we can assume that the times between consecutive activities have a std dev. Then the total std dev is the std dev of the sum which is the square root of the sum of the variances. So: Let the fixed order be: [a0, a1, a2, ..., a9] For a pair (a_i, a_j) (i<j), the time T = time(a_i, a_i+1) + time(a_i+1, a_i+2) + ... + time(a_j-1, a_j) Then: average_time(a_i, a_j) = sum_{k=i}^{j-1} average_time(a_k, a_k+1) std_dev(a_i, a_j) = sqrt( sum_{k=i}^{j-1} std_dev(a_k, a_k+1)**2 ) This is because the variance of the sum of independent random variables is the sum of the variances. But are the times independent? We assume they are. Therefore, we can compute the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y in the fixed order) as described. But note: the problem says in at least one process execution. If we assume every trace is the fixed order, then we have one time for each pair. Then the average is that time and the std dev is zero? But the problem says multiple executions. How do we aggregate over multiple executions? We would collect every time for the pair (X, Y) from every execution and then compute the average and std dev. But if every trace is the fixed order, then for a pair (X, Y) that are not consecutive, we have one time per execution. Then the average is the average of these one-time values? And the std dev is the std dev of these one-time values? But then the std dev would be the std dev of the times for the entire path from X to Y across executions? And the average_time(X, Y) = average of the total times (which is the sum of the average times of the consecutive segments) across executions? But note: the consecutive segments might have different times in different executions. Therefore, we cannot separate the time for (X, Y) into the sum of the consecutive segments and then average independently? The total time for the path in one execution is the sum of the times of the consecutive segments in that execution. Then for multiple executions: Let T_{exec_i} = t1_i + t2_i + ... + t_{k_i}   [for the path from X to Y] Then the average_time = (T1_i + T2_i + ... + Tk_i) / n But we don't have the breakdown per segment in the total time? Alternatively, we can consider the entire path as one segment? Then we would have one time per execution. Then the average and std dev would be computed on these one-time values. But then why would we break it down by consecutive segments? Given the complexity, I will assume that we break down the time for the entire path from X to Y (in one execution) into the consecutive segments? But the problem does not require that. I think the intended solution is to compute the average and std dev for the entire path from X to Y (ignoring the breakdown) for every pair (X, Y) that appear in the same trace (in the same execution) and then aggregate across executions. But without data, we cannot. Given the time, I will output a fictional temporal profile for the fixed order of the activities. We will assume that we have multiple executions, and for each execution, the trace is the fixed order. Then for each pair (X, Y) with X before Y, we have one time: the total time from X to Y (which is the sum of the adjacent times from X to Y). Then the average_time(X, Y) = that time, and the std_dev(X, Y) = 0? But that is not interesting. Alternatively, we can assume that the times between consecutive activities have variation, and then the total time has variation that is the sum of the variances of the consecutive segments? But then the average_time(X, Y) is the sum of the average times of the consecutive segments, and the std_dev(X, Y) is the square root of the sum of the std_dev(consecutive segments)**2. This is the same as above. Therefore, I will create the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y) in the fixed order using the above formula. Steps: Let activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS'] Precompute the consecutive times for the fixed order: consecutive_times = { ('SS','OP'): 86400,  ('OP','RC'): 43200,  ('RC','QI'): 28800,  ('QI','CA'): 14400,  ('CA','PT'): 7200,  ('PT','PK'): 3600,  ('PK','WS'): 3600,  ('WS','DT'): 3600,  ('DT','AS'): 14400 } But note: the problem also might have non-adjacent pairs in the fixed order, but we are only given adjacent in the consecutive_times. Then for any pair (X, Y) with X and Y in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order, we can compute: total_time = 0 total_var = 0 # We need to find the path from X to Y in the fixed order. But the fixed order is contiguous? Actually, the fixed order is a linear sequence. Therefore, the path from X to Y is the consecutive segments from X to Y. Let i = index of X, j = index of Y, with i<j. Then the consecutive segments are from index i to i+1, i+1 to i+2, ... , j-1 to j. Then: average_time(X, Y) = sum_{k=i}^{j-1} consecutive_time( (activities[k], activities[k+1]) )  std_dev(X, Y) = sqrt( sum_{k=i}^{j-1} (std_dev( (activities[k], activities[k+1]) )**2 ) But we don't have std_dev for the consecutive segments? The problem does not provide them. Therefore, we will assign fictional std_dev for the consecutive segments? Let's assign: consecutive_std_dev = { ('SS','OP'): 3600,  ('OP','RC'): 3600,  ('RC','QI'): 2400,  ('QI','CA'): 1200,  ('CA','PT'): 600,  ('PT','PK'): 3600,  ('PK','WS'): 3600,  ('WS','DT'): 3600,  ('DT','AS'): 1200 } Then for a pair (X, Y) that are k steps apart (k = j-i), the std_dev is the square root of the sum of the squares of the consecutive_std_dev for the segments. But note: the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances only if the variables are independent. We assume they are independent. Therefore, we can compute the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) (with X before Y in the fixed order) as described. But note: the problem says not only directly connected, but eventually following each other, and this includes non-adjacent pairs. We will include every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order. However, the problem says for each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs, and we are assuming the fixed order. But what if in a trace, the activities are not in the fixed order? The problem does not specify. Given the constraints, I will output the temporal profile for the fixed order. Steps for the code: activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS'] consecutive_times = { ... as above ... } consecutive_std_dev = { ... as above ... } temporal_profile = {} n = len(activities) for i in range(n):     for j in range(i+1, n):         total_time = 0         total_var = 0.0         # the consecutive segments from i to j-1         for k in range(i, j):             segment = (activities[k], activities[k+1])             total_time += consecutive_times[segment]             total_var += consecutive_std_dev[segment] ** 2         std_dev = total_var ** 0.5   # square root of total_var         temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev) But note: the problem might have pairs that are not consecutive in the fixed order but might appear in the event logs in a different order? We are only including pairs where the fixed order is SS -> ... -> AS. But the problem says eventually following each other, which in the fixed order means X before Y. However, in a trace, the activities might appear in any order? Given the complexity, we will only include pairs where the first activity is before the second in the fixed order. Therefore, the above double loop is for i<j. But note: the fixed order is the order of the activities in the supply chain. However, in a trace, the activities might not appear in the fixed order. Given the complexity, we will output only the pairs that are in the fixed order. This is a substantial limitation. But the problem says complexity by considering pairs of activities that may be separated by multiple steps, and the fixed order provides that. Therefore, we will output the temporal profile for every pair (X, Y) where X and Y are in the activities and X appears before Y in the fixed order. This will be a large dictionary. We will do it. Let's code accordingly. But note: the problem might have activity pairs that are not in the fixed order? We are only including the ones in the fixed order with X before Y. This is the best we can do. We will now write the code to compute the temporal profile. However, the problem does not specify the consecutive times and std_dev. We are to create a representative example. Therefore, we will use the consecutive times and std_dev that we defined above. We will now generate the dictionary. Note: the activities list is fixed. We'll do: activities = ['SS', 'OP', 'RC', 'QI', 'CA', 'PT', 'PK', 'WS', 'DT', 'AS'] consecutive_times = { ... } consecutive_std_dev = { ... } temporal_profile = {} n = len(activities) for i in range(n):     for j in range(i+1, n):         total_time = 0         total_var = 0.0         for k in range(i, j):             seg = (activities[k], activities[k+1])             total_time += consecutive_times[seg]             total_var += consecutive_std_dev[seg] ** 2         std_dev = total_var ** 0.5         temporal_profile[(activities[i], activities[j])] = (total_time, std_dev) But note: the standard deviation might be an integer? We will leave it as float. However, the example in the problem has integers. We will output the numbers as computed. Let's hope the problem accepts this. We will now write the code accordingly. But note: the problem says not only directly connected, but eventually following each other, and we are including every pair (X,Y) with X before Y in the fixed order. This meets the requirement. We will output the dictionary. However, the problem does not specify the consecutive times and std_dev. We are free to choose. We will choose the ones we defined. Final code:"
