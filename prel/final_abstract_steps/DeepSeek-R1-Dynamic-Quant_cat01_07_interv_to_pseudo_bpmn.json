    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Generalized from Rita’s account that exceptions (e.g., missing PO, unresolved discrepancies) often escalate to her, and noted that this step reintegrates into the normal process flow after resolution."

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Considered scenarios where a supplier does not provide a valid PO or resolve discrepancies—hypothesized that in such cases, Rita steps in to decide on retrospective POs or rejections, even though interview details were incomplete."
