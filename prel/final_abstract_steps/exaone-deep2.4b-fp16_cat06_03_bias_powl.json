    "Text": "Starting with the model: The XOR construct here is part of the xor_local_check operator. XOR means that either D is taken or the skip (which has no effect) is chosen. So, depending on the outcome of the XOR, the applicant might go through the D transition or skip it."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The problem might be that the act of skipping D could be advantageous for certain groups. For instance, if the local affiliation check is meant to favor certain communities, but by allowing some to skip it, those who would otherwise be excluded (based on their affiliation) could be excluded more than others."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Alternatively, perhaps the XOR is structured such that when the system decides to take D, it might introduce some bias in how D is implemented."

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Suppose that the local affiliation check (D) leads to a higher score boost than skipping. Then applicants who can skip (because they don't have the affiliation) would not get that boost, but maybe that's intended."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Let me parse the model again. The act of skipping D might mean that groups that donâ€™t face the requirement for local affiliation are allowed to proceed more easily, granting them an advantage."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The XOR allows either D or skip. If the decision to skip is possible without any conditions, then applicants who would otherwise have to go through D (maybe those not in the local groups) can avoid that step."

  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In terms of implications, giving a non-legally protected group an incremental advantage like this could undermine fairness. If the group's advantage is unintended (e.g., the check was supposed to be neutral but allowed skips), it could lead to discriminatory practices."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "If the local affiliation check is tied to resource access (e.g., higher credit scores for local applicants), skipping could allow non-local applicants to bypass critical steps, skewing outcomes in favor of groups with resources to exploit the skip."
