    "Text": "First, I need to understand the process thoroughly. The supply chain starts with R&D, then sourcing components from various countries, assembly in Malaysia, distribution to regional centers, and then to retailers and customers. There are elements like lead times, quality metrics, logistics, inventory strategies (JIT for high-demand, monthly for slow-moving), compliance, digital systems, and sustainability."

    "Text": "Now, to generate questions. Let me break it down into sections. Starting with R&D and design: How does the company balance innovation with supply chain constraints? Maybe the lead times for components could affect the design process. Then, supplier management: How do they manage different lead times and quality metrics? What if a key supplier has delays?"
