    "Text": "In a real system, youd need a way to stop the loop after one iteration (like a finalize step). But here, since its just A and I with no exit, the process could theoretically run forever. Thats extremely problematic for operations - it would cause system errors, duplicate invoices, or stuck orders."

In a production system, this could be a major security risk too (e.g., someone could trigger infinite loops to overwhelm the system)."

They probably want concrete examples of why these break business rules. Ill emphasize how these anomalies violate fundamental order-to-cash principles: credit checks must happen before approval, and each order should be processed once."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Also noting that the model has no way to exit the loop - thats a critical flaw. In proper workflows, loops should have a clear termination condition (like a complete transition). Here, the loop is just a repeated cycle with no exit path, which is dangerous."
