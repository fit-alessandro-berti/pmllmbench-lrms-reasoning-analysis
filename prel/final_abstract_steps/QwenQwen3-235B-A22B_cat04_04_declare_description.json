Wait, DECLAREs altsuccession is a combination of response and precedence, so if A altsuccession B, then if A occurs, B must occur after, and if B occurs, A must occur before. Wait, maybe I should recall DECLARE constraints. Let me think: Altsuccession also known as mutual succession would mean that whenever A occurs, B must occur after, and whenever B occurs, A must occur before. So they have to be in order, but mutual. Maybe not. Alternatively, maybe its a mutual either-or. Hmm, perhaps I should check. But given the model, the key point is that theres an altsuccession between Gather_Additional_Documents and Quality_Assurance_Review. So if either happens, the other must happen in the correct order. Wait, maybe the altsuccession here is actually enforcing that if either activity occurs, they must be in sequence. But the models altsuccession for Gather_Additional_Documents has target Quality_Assurance_Review. So perhaps this is a mutual constraint where if Gather happens, QA must follow, and if QA happens, Gather must precede.

But that cant be right because Transfer_Funds is in the process. Wait, this must be an error. Wait the model has noncoexistence: Transfer_Funds: ..., target Receive_Application. So Transfer_Funds and Receive_Application cant coexist. But Receive_Application is mandatory. So this would imply that Transfer_Funds cant happen, which contradicts the process. Maybe theres a mistake here Or perhaps Im misunderstanding noncoexistence. Noncoexistence says that two activities cannot both be present in the same case. So if Receive_Application is required, then Transfer_Funds must never occur, which isnt possible. This might be a tricky part. Alternatively, maybe the model has a mistake here. But since the user says all support and confidence are 1.0, but the constraints must be considered. This might be a problem in the model, but perhaps in the explanation, we should note that this constraint would conflict with the presence of Transfer_Funds. However, given that Transfer_Funds is part of the process since its in the altresponse and other constraints, perhaps this is an error.
