    "Text": "The policys justification might be to encourage local community involvement but the lack of evidence proving that membership in these groups actually correlates with financial responsibility is a big issue Plus since its not a legally protected class they might think its okay but it still creates inequality The hidden adjustment also violates transparency which is key in ethical practices"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the main points are the community integration check introducing bias through undisclosed advantages the manual reviews subjective factors and the overall disparate impact even without targeting protected classes The justifiability hinges on whether the community factor is a valid predictor of creditworthiness which isnt established here making it an unjustifiable bias that undermines fairness and equity"
