The key points are matching events based on order_id and timestamp proximity, enriching attributes where possible, and handling mismatches or non-overlapping events appropriately."

    "Text": "Looking at Log A and Log B, I notice that both have similar but not identical event types. For example, Log A has \"Order Received\" while Log B uses \"OrderReceived\". The timestamps are close but not exactly the same. Also, Log B includes additional attributes like user_id, resource_id, and notes that aren't present in Log A."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "My approach should be to first align events based on order_id since that's a common identifier. Then, compare timestamps within a small tolerance (like 2 seconds as mentioned). If two events from different logs have the same order_id and their timestamps are close enough, they likely represent the same event and can be merged. I'll need to combine all attributes from both logs for these matched events."
