Log B has six events for the same order, but the event names are different (like OrderReceived vs Order Validated), and there are extra attributes like user_id and resource_id. The timestamps in Log B are slightly off; for example, the OrderReceived in Log B is at 095958Z, which is just a few seconds before the Order Received in Log A."

Thats outside the 2-second window. So they shouldnt be merged."

Wait, in the case of Order Validated, Log As 100130Z is 1 second after Log Bs 100129Z. Since the tolerance is 2 seconds, both are acceptable.

    "Text": "After merging, the events need to be sorted chronologically. The chosen primary timestamps (from Log A where possible) should determine the order. Now, for the final output, each merged event should include all attributes from both logs. For example, the merged OrderReceived and Order Validated would have event_type as both OrderReceived and OrderValidated, along with the combined timestamps and user/resource IDs. Potential conflicts: The Quality Check in Log B doesnt have a counterpart in Log A, so its kept separate. The Payment Check wasnt merged due to the timestamp difference. I should also document the reasoning, explaining the matching criteria, how timestamps were handled, and why certain events were left separate. For example, the Payment Check wasnt merged because it was 3 seconds after the corresponding Log A event. Finally, present the merged log in chronological order, ensuring all relevant attributes are included and the reasoning is clear."
