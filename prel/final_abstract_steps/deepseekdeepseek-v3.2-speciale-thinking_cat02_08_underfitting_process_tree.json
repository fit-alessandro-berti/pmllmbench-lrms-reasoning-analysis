First, lets interpret the process tree structure: root is a SEQUENCE with children: receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order. So root requires that the trace has, in order: first receive_order, then check_inventory, then the xor_node must be executed, then close_order. The xor_node is a XOR between two subtrees: successful_subtree and cancel_subtree."
