The first time is early in the process when the agent checks identity documents, and the second time is after the customer submits additional documents. So these are clearly different - one is initial verification, the other is re-verification after missing docs are provided."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "For Case C002, I notice Call Customer appears twice. The first call is to clarify an account discrepancy, and the second is a follow-up to confirm adjustments. So these need distinct names like Initial Clarification Call and Confirmation Follow-up Call."

    "Text": "Wait, let me double-check C003's Call Customer event. The context says Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return. So this is about rescheduling, not verification. That's distinct from the other call activities. I should make sure it's clearly different from the verification-related calls."

    "Text": "Wait, the instruction says to rename based on context within the case, not across cases. But since the same activity name appears multiple times in a single case, I need to disambiguate within the same case flow. For C001, the two Verify Documents are sequential, so differentiating them as initial vs re-verification makes sense. Similarly for C002's two calls."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But looking at the other cases: C001 and C002 use Verify Documents without specifying physical, so for consistency in renaming, I should keep the context-specific descriptors. So for C003 first Verify, since it's physical, Physical Document Verification is good. For the second one, Re-Verification After Account Adjustment captures the context."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, C001's Call Customer is actually the same activity name as C002's first call, but different context. So I need to rename all instances based on their own context, not comparing across cases. So for C001's Call Customer, since it's to request missing docs, it should be Request Missing Documents Call. For C002's first call, it's for account discrepancy, so Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy. For C003's call, it's rescheduling, so Rescheduling Call."
