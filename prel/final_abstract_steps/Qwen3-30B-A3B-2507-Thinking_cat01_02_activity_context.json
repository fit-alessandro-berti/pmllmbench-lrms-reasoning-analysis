    "Text": "Wait, let me double-check C003s Call Customer event. The context says Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return. So this is about rescheduling, not verification.

    "Text": "Let me verify if all renamed activities now have unique names per case: C001: Initial Document Verification → Re-Verification After Submission C002: Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy → Confirmation Follow-up Call C003: Physical Document Verification → Re-Verification After Account Adjustment And C003s Call Customer becomes Rescheduling Call... The branch cases Verify Documents first instance is Physical Verification - thats different from the back-office Initial Document Verification in other cases. But since the context specifies Physical verification of ID at branch, I should include Physical in the name to distinguish it. Wait, the instruction says to rename based on context within the case, not across cases. But since the same activity name appears multiple times in a single case, I need to disambiguate within the same case flow. For C001, the two Verify Documents are sequential, so differentiating them as initial vs re-verification makes sense. Similarly for C002s two calls. For C003, the first Verify Documents is physical, but since its the first occurrence in that case, and the second is after adjustment, Ill name them Initial Physical Document Verification and Re-Verification After Account Adjustment. But Initial might be redundant since its the first. Maybe just Physical Document Verification for the first one, since physical is the key context, and Re-Verification After Account Adjustment for the second. But looking at the other cases: C001 and C002 use Verify Documents without specifying physical, so for consistency in renaming, I should keep the context-specific descriptors. So for C003 first Verify, since its physical, Physical Document Verification is good. For the second one, Re-Verification After Account Adjustment captures the context."

    "Text": "Now for the calls: C001s Call Customer: Verification Incomplete - Request Missing Docs → but the context says Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. So Request Missing Documents Call might be better. C002s first call: Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy C002s second call: Confirmation Follow-up Call C003s call: Rescheduling Call After Customer Departure I think I have it. Let me map all: For each recurring activity: Verify Documents in C001: first time = Initial Document Verification, second = Re-Verification After Submission Verify Documents in C003: first time = Physical Document Verification, second = Re-Verification After Account Adjustment Call Customer in C002: first = Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy, second = Confirmation Follow-up Call Call Customer in C001: not the same as C002, but its a different context - Request Missing Documents Call Call Customer in C003: Rescheduling Call After Customer Departure Wait, C001s Call Customer is actually the same activity name as C002s first call, but different context. So I need to rename all instances based on their own context, not comparing across cases. So for C001s Call Customer, since its to request missing docs, it should be Request Missing Documents Call. For C002s first call, its for account discrepancy, so Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy. For C003s call, its rescheduling, so Rescheduling Call. This way, even though the activity name Call Customer is reused, the new names make the contexts clear."

    "Text": "I think this covers all. Now to justify each change: For C001s second Verify Documents: Context says re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided → Re-Verification After Submission clarifies its after submission. C002s first Call: clarify account discrepancy → Clarification Call for Account Discrepancy specifies the purpose. C002s second Call: follow-up to confirm adjustments → Confirmation Follow-up Call. C003s first Verify: Physical verification → Physical Document Verification distinguishes from electronic. C003s second Verify: re-verify after account adjustment → Re-Verification After Account Adjustment. C001s Call: request missing docs → Request Missing Documents Call clarifies the action. The only potential issue is whether Initial Document Verification for C002s first Verify is redundant since its the first occurrence, but its consistent with C001s first one. Since C001s first is also initial, naming it Initial helps distinguish from the re-verification. Also, Submit Additional is unique so no change needed. I think this should work. Now to write the revised log and justifications."
