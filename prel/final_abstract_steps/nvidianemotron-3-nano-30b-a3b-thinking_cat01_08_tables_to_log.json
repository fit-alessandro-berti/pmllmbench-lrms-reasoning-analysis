The instruction: If multiple timestamps are available (e.g., item_picking_date for multiple items), produce one event per activity if its meaningful, or summarize if appropriate. We can produce two separate events: one for each item picked (maybe activity Item Picked - ITEM-001 or generic Item(s) Picked with quantity? Could produce separate rows with activity Item Picked and additional attribute item_id. Simpler: produce one event Items Picked with timestamp maybe earliest picking date? But we have two dates: 2024-01-02T10:15 and 2024-01-02T11:00. Could produce two events: Item Picked - ITEM-001 at 10:15, Item Picked - ITEM-002 at 11:00. Resource = picker_id (WH-001 and WH-002).

For order 1004 we used INV-1005? Wait invoice table: INV-1005 is for order 1005. So order 1004 has no invoice? Actually there is no invoice for order 1004 in the provided invoice table.
