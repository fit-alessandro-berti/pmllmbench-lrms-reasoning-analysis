But the prompt says that for the keys, the value is a dictionary with support (1.0) and confidence. Wait, maybe the support and confidence are fixed as 1.0?

For example, existence would mean that each activity in the dictionary must exist in the process. But maybe the existence rule is that certain activities must occur. Wait, but the DECLARE models existence rule is that each activity in the existence dictionary must be present in the process. So, for example, if I have existence: {IG: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0}, ...}, that would mean that IG must exist. But maybe in this scenario, all activities are required?

Wait, according to the prompt, for the keys like response, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule. Wait, but how does that work? ... Maybe the structure is different. Wait, maybe the DECLARE models structure for these rules is such that for each rule type, the activities are paired. For example, in response, each entry is a pair (A, B), meaning that whenever A occurs, B must occur. But how is that represented in the dictionary? The prompt says that for the keys like response, the value is a dictionary with activities as keys and support and confidence. So perhaps for each activity A, the value is a dictionary with the B activities that must follow, along with their support and confidence. But the prompt says that the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence. That suggests that for each activity in the keys dictionary, the value is support and confidence. But that doesnt make sense for a response rule... This is conflicting."

So, for example, for the response rule, if we have a rule that DD must be followed by TFC, then in the response dictionary, the key would be DD, and the value would be {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0}.
