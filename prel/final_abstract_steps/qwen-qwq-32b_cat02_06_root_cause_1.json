    "Text": "Maybe the L2 team only works 85 so overnight tasks are pending until next morning So thats an overnight delay So if the investigation is done at 1400 then the next step Resolve cant be done until next day Similarly case 104s delay between Investigation and Resolve is 19 hours which is overnight So thats a systemic issue if the team isnt available overnight For case 105 The major delay is between Escalation 1000 March 1 and next Investigate 1400 next day March 2 Thats 28 hours So the L2 team didnt start until the next day perhaps due to not working nights leading to a 28hour gap Thus a possible root cause is that escalated tickets are only handled during business hours leading to delays when escalated near the end of the day the core issue is the team not working after hours causing overnight steps to take a day longer Therefore the main pattern is that any step that ends before the end of the workday will have to wait until next day adding a full days delay So for example if the L1 agent investigates at 1300 case 104 then needs to wait until next day to resolve adding 19 hours"
