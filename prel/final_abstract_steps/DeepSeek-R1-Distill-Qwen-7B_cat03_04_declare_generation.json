    "Text": "From the prompt, I see that the DECLARE model is a Python dictionary with specific keys. There are two main categories of keys: one set for the first part (`'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init'`) and another set for the second part, which includes various relations like 'responded_existence', 'coexistence', and so on."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "For the first set of keys (`'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init'`), each key's value should be a dictionary where the keys are activities and the values are tuples containing support and confidence. The support is usually 1.0 for these keys, and confidence might be provided if available."

PC builds a prototype. LT tests the prototype in a lab. UT tests it with users. AG gets management approval. MP formulates a marketing plan. FL launches the product."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Now, I'll try to map the activities to the keys. Starting with the first set: 1. existence: Maybe each activity exists if its predecessor exists. So for each activity except the first, existence depends on the predecessor. 2. absence: Maybe each activity's absence depends on the absence of the next activity. Not sure. 3. exactly_one: Maybe only one of the activities exists. 4. init: Maybe the initial activity (IG) exists."
