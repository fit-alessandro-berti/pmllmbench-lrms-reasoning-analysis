Let me note that down: A -> (RG -> IA).\n\nAfter IA, there's the triage process, which has two mandatory steps: Triage Interview (TI) and Triage Classification (TC). These should be in sequence too, so it's TI -> TC. Since this is part of the main flow after IA, the process so far would be A -> RG -> IA -> (TI -> TC)."
