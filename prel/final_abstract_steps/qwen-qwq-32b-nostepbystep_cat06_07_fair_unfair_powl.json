Wait, the loop operator's first child is the condition, and the second is the body? Or maybe the loop is structured as executing the first, then the second, then back to first? Hmm, according to the example given, a loop between A and B means execute A, then either exit or execute B then A again. So in this case, the first step is DataCompletenessCheck (the first part of the loop). If the data is incomplete, the loop continues by doing the second part (RequestMoreInfo), then back to A again.
