So RT is a re-test, which implies a loop between TST and RT. So if TST fails, you do RT and then repeat TST. So that's another loop.

Wait, but in case 4, after AS, they proceed directly to TST. So the IQC loop is optional.

Wait, but case4 has only one AS, so the loop is entered once, then exited. So the loop is executed once, but the B part (IQC) is not executed.

The example logs don't show any obvious concurrency, except perhaps LB and DP? Wait, no. In the logs, after PK comes LB (if present), then DP, then D. So they are in sequence. However, the problem statement mentions that unconnected nodes in a partial order are concurrent. So the main structure is a sequence with some choices and loops."
