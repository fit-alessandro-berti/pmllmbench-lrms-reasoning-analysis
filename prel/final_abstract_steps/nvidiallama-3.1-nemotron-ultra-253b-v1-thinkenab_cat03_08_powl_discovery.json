Lets verify against the logs Case1 OR MS QS loop1 AS, IQC loop2 TST, RT PK xor LB DP D Inside loop1 AS IQC AS then exit TST... Wait, in case1, after AS, IQC is done, then AS again. So loop1 is executed as AS, then IQC, then loop back to AS. Then after exiting loop1, proceed to loop2. Loop2 TST RT TST then exit PK. So the model allows for that. Case4 OR MS QS loop1 AS, exits immediately loop2 TST, exits PK xor skip DP D. Yes, thats covered. The choice after PK is between LB and skip. So in case2, the skip is chosen, so LB is omitted.
