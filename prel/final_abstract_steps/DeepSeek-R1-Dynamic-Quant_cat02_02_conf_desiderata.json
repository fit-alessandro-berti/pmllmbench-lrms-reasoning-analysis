That's a violation because according to ordering rules, Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they did a Credit Check after Risk Assessment, which reverses the required order. So that's two problems: skipping Credit Check initially and reversing the sequence. Then Loan Decision (Rejected). After rejection, they Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed per the key constraints. You shouldn't finalize docs after rejection; closing should happen without it. Then Close Case. The finalizing here breaks the rule. So multiple violations in this case: incorrect order of Risk Assessment before Credit Check and doing Finalize after rejection."

Loan Decision approved on Jan 14 @12:00. Inform Applicant happens on Jan 16, two days later—so more than 48 hours from loan decision (Jan 14 to Jan 16 is two full days? If Loan Decision at 1200 on Jan 14 and Inform at 1500 on Jan 16, that’s approx 51 hours. So over the recommended 48h). Hence violating desiderata.

Wait no—original log for Case2: Application Received on 2024-01-11 8:00 Then Risk Assessment @8:20 — but credit check comes later at 9:00.

    "Text": "Case3 violates both credit check timing (>24h) and inform applicant delay (>48h after loan decision). Also lacks follow-up call. So multiple desideratum misses. Now for interpretations/justifications. Maybe in Case2, maybe they did Risk Assessment first due to an error or oversight—human mistake could explain the order reversal. However, according to strict rules, this is invalid. For Finalizing docs after rejection, perhaps a procedural error where someone forgot it was rejected and proceeded normally. For case3's delays, possible high workload causing delayed processing, hence credit check took longer than desired but still complied with sequence. The inform applicant delay could be due to communication lags or waiting for other approvals before informing."
