For order creation, the Orders table has order_date, so I can create an event for that. Then, the Order Lines table shows items and quantities, so for each item, I need to map that to an activity. The order lines might have events like Picked or Dispatched, so I need to check the Delivery table for dispatch and arrival dates. Also, the Invoice and Payment tables indicate when invoices are issued or paid, which are important events."

If there's only one, maybe sum them. Also, ensure that the chronological order is correct. For example, order creation should happen before picking, which happens before delivery, and so on."

Then, the Delivery has dispatch and arrival dates, so events for dispatch and arrival. Then, invoices and payments. Also, check if the Resources table has any info, like SP-001 for sales, etc."
