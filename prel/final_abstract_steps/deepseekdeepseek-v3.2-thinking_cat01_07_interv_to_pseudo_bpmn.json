Then Ill map the exception handling paths, like missing PO, discrepancies, and escalations. The roles are clearly defined across the interviews, so I can assign tasks to Accounts Payable, Purchasing, Manager, Supervisor, and Supplier Relationship Manager."

Ill include notes where accounts differ slightly, like whether the managers approval is always required or if there are informal service invoices. The artifacts mentioned (invoice, PO, confirmation email) should be tracked as data objects."
