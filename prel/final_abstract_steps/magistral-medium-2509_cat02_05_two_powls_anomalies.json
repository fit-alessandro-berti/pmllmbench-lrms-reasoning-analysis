    "Text": "Now looking at Model 1 Model 1 is defined as a StrictPartialOrder with nodes Post Screen Decide Interview Onboard Payroll Close The order relations are Post Screen Screen Decide Screen Interview Decide Onboard Onboard Payroll Payroll Close Hmm the standard sequence is Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard Payroll Close But here Screen has edges to both Decide and Interview So after screening you can go directly to making a decision or to conducting interviews That seems odd because typically youd screen candidates then interview the shortlisted ones then make a decision So having Screen Decide means you could make a hiring decision without conducting interviews Thats an anomaly But also Screen Interview is there so you could do interviews after screening which is correct But the problem is that Decide comes after Screen but Interview is also after Screen but theres no relation between Interview and Decide Wait in the standard process Interview should come before Decide But here Screen Decide and Screen Interview but no edge from Interview to Decide So Decide could happen before Interview Wait no the edges are Screen Decide and Screen Interview but no edge between Interview and Decide So in a partial order that means Decide and Interview could be in any order relative to each other as long as both are after Screen But thats a problem because you should conduct interviews before making a hiring decision So the anomaly here is that MakeHiringDecision Decide could occur before ConductInterviews Interview which doesnt make sense Normally you interview first then decide Also in Model 1 theres no constraint between Interview and Decide So its possible to have Decide before Interview which is illogical Thats a clear anomaly"

    "Text": "Which model is more aligned with the normative process Model 1 has the issue that Decide could come before Interview but at least all activities are present and must be done no skipping In Model 2 you can skip payroll which is a major issue and you can interview before screening But in Model 1 the sequence could be Post Screen Decide Onboard Payroll Close skipping Interview entirely Wait no because Screen Interview is also an edge but in a partial order if theres no direct edge requiring Interview to happen could Interview be skipped Wait in Model 1 the nodes are Post Screen Decide Interview Onboard Payroll Close The edges are PostScreen ScreenDecide ScreenInterview DecideOnboard etc So Screen has edges to both Decide and Interview But theres no edge from Interview to Decide or vice versa So in the partial order Interview and Decide are both after Screen but their order relative to each other is not specified That means its possible to have Screen Decide without doing Interview or Screen Interview Decide or Screen Decide Interview but that wouldnt make sense logically but the model allows it because theres no constraint But the problem is that the model allows for Decide before Interview which is an anomaly"

    "Text": "But lets think about the standard process The normative sequence is Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard Payroll Close In Model 1 the possible sequences include Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard Payroll Close correct Post Screen Decide Interview Onboard Payroll Close incorrect decide before interview But also is it possible to skip Interview In a strict partial order all nodes must be executed so Interview must happen but its order relative to Decide isnt fixed So you cant skip Interview but it could be after Decide In Model 2 possible sequences include Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard Payroll Close correct assuming looponboarding does Onboard once and xorpayroll chooses Payroll Post Interview Screen Decide incorrect interview before screen Post Screen Interview Decide looponboarding Onboard multiple times skip payroll Close incorrect no payroll Model 2 has more severe anomalies skipping payroll and interviewing before screening Model 1 doesnt have the payroll skipping issue but it allows making a decision before interviewing Which is worse Skipping payroll is a major issue because the employee wouldnt get paid But making a decision before interviewing is also bad but perhaps less severe than not adding to payroll Model 1s main anomaly is that Decide could come before Interview but at least all steps are executed So perhaps Model 1 is closer to the normative process even though it has an anomaly in the order of Interview and Decide But wait in the standard process Interview must come before Decide In Model 1 its possible to have Decide before Interview which violates that In Model 2 you can have Interview before Screen which also violates the standard But Model 2 also allows skipping payroll which is a bigger problem So between the two Model 1 might be better because it doesnt allow skipping critical steps even though the order of Interview and Decide isnt enforced For Model 1 Anomaly Screen Decide and Screen Interview with no constraint between Interview and Decide allowing Decide before Interview Also is there a possibility to skip Interview No because all nodes must be executed in a strict partial order The issue is the order between Interview and Decide not whether theyre both done In Model 2 you could skip Payroll entirely which is a major problem Thus Model 1 is better Model 2 has three anomalies one of which is severe skipping payroll while Model 1 has one anomaly possible Decide before Interview Therefore Model 1 is more aligned with the normative process"
