    "Text": "So Model 1 anomaly The ordering of activities is incorrect Specifically the interview Conduct Interviews is placed after Make Hiring Decision Decide In a normative Hire to Retire process the interview should occur prior to making a hiring decision There might also be some ambiguity regarding branching or loop structures It simply lists all nodes in order and uses strict partial ordering with edges that are not reflective of the actual process logic for instance having multiple choices at screening Also it is somewhat unusual because typically after screening candidates you conduct interviews and then decide But here Decide comes before Interview So Model 1 violates the sequence by putting Make Hiring Decision before conducting interviews"
