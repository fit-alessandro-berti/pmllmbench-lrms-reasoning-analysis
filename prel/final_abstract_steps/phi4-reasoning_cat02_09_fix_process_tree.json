For example, paying invoice before receiving goods is possible if the steps in the parallel block run out of order. - Correction: Replace parallel block with a sequence operator and arrange activities in the intended linear order: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Create Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice to PO, Pay Invoice, Close Case."
