    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - IND",

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For Case 1003, I deduced that the out-of-sequence approval (payment released before invoice and goods) is most likely due to mismanagement or lack of adherence to controls, as standard operations wouldn't involve releasing a payment before confirming receipt of goods or services."

    "Text": "In Case 1004, I identified the anomaly where goods were received before issuing a Purchase Order. I generated the hypothesis that this indicates unauthorized purchases or after-the-fact authorization of deliveries, which could lead to compliance or fraud risks."

    "Name": "Validation - IND",
    "Text": "To confirm the anomalies in Case 1004, I cross-checked the standard flow (PO is issued before goods are received) against the event log sequence (Receive Goods before Issue PO). This validated my hypothesis for this case."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I deduced that these anomalies across all three cases (1002, 1003, 1004) disrupt internal controls and increase risks such as errors, fraud, or financial loss. They bypass checks that are foundational to the Procure-to-Pay process."
