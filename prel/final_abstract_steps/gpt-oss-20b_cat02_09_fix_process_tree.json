    "Text": "Simplest fix: replace parallel block with a sequence of activities in correct order: create_po -> receive_goods -> receive_invoice -> match_invoice -> pay_invoice. Alternatively we could allow some concurrency between receive_goods and receive_invoice using an AND operator but then ensure that match occurs after both have completed using a synchronization point like an AND-join? In process trees we can use AND operator with children [receive_goods, receive_invoice] followed by match... But this would allow them to happen in any order but still require both done before proceeding to next step because AND operator ensures all children must complete before moving on."
