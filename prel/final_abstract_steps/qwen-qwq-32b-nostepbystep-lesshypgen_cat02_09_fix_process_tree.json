Looking at the problem's given standard logic, the steps are in the order given, so step 4 comes before 5. So the standard sequence requires that receiving goods (4) comes before receiving invoice (5), then matching (6) which requires both the invoice and PO. So the order is strictly 3 4 5 6 7."

    "Text": "Wait, but let me confirm each step's dependencies: - Create_PO must come after approving the requisition, which it is, since the first part is sequential. Then: - After Create_PO (step3), you can then receive goods (step4), which would logically come next. Then, after receiving goods, you then receive the invoice (step5). But maybe receiving invoice can be done after the PO is created, but according to the standard order, it's step5, which is after step4. So the steps 4 and 5 are in order. Then, matching the invoice to the PO (step6) must come after both receiving the invoice and having the PO. Since the PO is already created before, but the invoice must be received first. So step6 comes after step5. Then, paying (step7) must come after matching, and finally close case."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Another point: The Match step requires that both invoice and PO are received. Since the invoice is received in step5, which comes before match (step6), which is correct. The PO was created in step3, so that is already done. Thus, the corrected model would enforce all the dependencies correctly."
