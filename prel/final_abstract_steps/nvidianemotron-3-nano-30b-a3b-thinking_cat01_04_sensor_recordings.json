Actually after high vibration and flow, then pressure rises to 2, vibration drops, flow reduces, tool position increases to 15, energy stable. Could be finishing or post-processing."

Phase 4: Event 9 High-Temp Operation e.g. welding or heat treatment. Phase 5: Events 10-12 Cooling/Inspection. Phase 6: Events 13-15 Idle/End of Cycle. Explain each. Provide rationale: temperature spikes correlate with vibration and flow; tool position changes indicate movement; energy consumption patterns."
