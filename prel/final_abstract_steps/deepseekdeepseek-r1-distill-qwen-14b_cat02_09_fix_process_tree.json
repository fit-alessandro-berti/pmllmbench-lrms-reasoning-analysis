That means from the point where the Purchase Order is created, the next steps can happen in any order. So, for example, someone could pay the invoice before receiving the goods or the invoice, which doesnt make sense."

    "Text": "So the main issue is that steps 3 through 7 are happening in parallel, allowing any order, but they should follow a specific sequence. Let me break down the proper flow: After creating and approving the requisition, you create the Purchase Order (step 3). From there, you need to receive the goods (step 4). Once goods are received, you can receive the invoice (step 5). Then, you match the invoice to the PO (step 6), and finally, you pay the invoice (step 7). After all that, you close the case."

    "Text": "Let me think if there are any points where choices or parallel paths are acceptable. For example, after receiving the goods, can you have multiple invoices? Probably not, as each PO should have one invoice. So, the sequence should enforce that after receiving goods, you receive the invoice, match it, then pay."

Maybe in some cases, but for the underfitting issue, the main problem is allowing steps to happen in the wrong order, so the model must enforce the correct sequence."
