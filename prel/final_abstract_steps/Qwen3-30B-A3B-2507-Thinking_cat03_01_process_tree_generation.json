    "Text": "Starting from the beginning: Arrival (A) -> Registration (RG) -> Intake Assessment (IA). That's a clear sequence. So I'll need a sequence operator for these three. Wait, but the example shows -> as the sequence operator, so in code it would be Operator.SEQUENCE."

Then the exclusive choice for initial tests: CE or FBP. That's an XOR operator. The description says only one of these tests will be performed, so exclusive choice - perfect for Operator.XOR."

    "Text": "After the initial test, results evaluation leads to a loop if abnormal. The loop structure is described as: SC -> (TM or SPT) -> RDT -> (FCE or FBA), repeating until normal. So this loop has a condition (abnormal results), but the process tree operators don't handle conditions - it's modeled as a loop structure where the loop continues until exit. The * operator is defined as A is executed, then either exit or execute B and then A again. I think the intended meaning is that the loop operator * has a body, and the exit is when the condition fails. But here, the operator is defined with two arguments. I think for the purpose of this problem, we should model the loop as * ( body, tau ), where body is the sequence of activities, and tau represents the continue action."

    "Text": "Now, after the loop ends (when results are normal), the patient proceeds to advanced imaging and nutritional counseling in true concurrency: AI and NC. So that's a PARALLEL operator: + (AI, NC). Then a sequence: FAS then DDI. Finally, the parallel admin tasks: BL, ICP, MRF in concurrency, so + (BL, ICP, MRF), but since it's three, we need to nest the PARALLEL. In the example, they used a PARALLEL with two children, so for three, it would be + (BL, + (ICP, MRF)) or something."

A (leaf) 2. RG (leaf) 3. IA (leaf) 4. Triage sequence (TI -> TC) 5. Initial test XOR (CE or FBP) 6. Loop ( * (body, tau) ) 7. Advanced imaging and nutrition ( + (AI, NC) ) 8. FAS (leaf) 9.

Also, for the loop, we have * (loop_body, tau), which allows exiting after the first loop_body execution. The admin concurrency is nested properly. So this should be the solution."
