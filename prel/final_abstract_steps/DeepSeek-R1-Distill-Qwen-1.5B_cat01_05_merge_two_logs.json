Both logs have events for an order fulfillment process, but they're recorded by different systems with different attributes and timestamps. First, I should understand the main goal. I need to create a single, unified event log by aligning corresponding events from both logs. The key here is to match events that represent the same occurrence, merge them if possible, and include all relevant attributes. If an event is only in one log, it stays as is. Also, I have to handle slight time differences and attribute variations."

However, the user didn't specify that, so maybe just sort by timestamp and let them be ordered. Wait, but the user said to use a small timestamp tolerance, so perhaps it's better to consider two timestamps as the same if their difference is less than 2 seconds. So, when merging, if two timestamps are within 2 seconds, they are treated as the same event, regardless of order. So, in the merged log, they will appear in the order they were first encountered.
