So we can model: After t_DV, we have a place p2 that leads to two transitions: one for the case when documents are complete (lets call it t_DV_OK) and another for incomplete (t_DV_incomplete). But actually, we dont have two transitions for DV, we have one. The problem says: if documents are incomplete, then RDS occurs. So we can model: t_DV fires and puts a token in p2. Then, from p2 we have two choices... in Petri nets, we dont have conditions, so we model the two possibilities by having two arcs from p2 to two different transitions... Actually, the next activity after DV (if complete) is FC. The next activity after RDS is DV again. So we can model: p_DV -> t_FC   (if the documents are complete, then we go to FC) p_DV -> t_RDS   (if the documents are incomplete, then we go to RDS). Then, after t_RDS, we have an arc to p_DV?
