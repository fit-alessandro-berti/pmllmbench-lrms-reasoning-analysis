For the document verification loop: We have: t_DV: Document Verification Then, after t_DV, we have a place p_DV. Then, if the documents are complete, we go to t_FC? But if they are incomplete, we go to t_RDS. So we need two transitions from p_DV: one that goes to t_FC (meaning we are doing fraud check) and one that goes to t_RDS. But note: we cannot have two outgoing arcs to two different transitions without conditions? And we dont have a condition in the net. Alternatively, we can model the decision as two transitions that are concurrent? But that doesnt capture the exclusive choice. Since we are in a Petri net, we can use a place that has a token and then two transitions that are in conflict? But how do we decide which one fires? The net by itself doesnt decide, its non-deterministic. But in practice, we would have a condition (which we dont model). So we just model the possibility. We can have: t_DV -> p_DV p_DV -> t_FC_ok?   [but we dont have a t_FC_ok, we have t_FC?] -> This is confusing. Actually, the next activity after DV (if complete) is FC. The next activity after RDS is DV again. So we can model: p_DV -> t_FC   (if the documents are complete, then we go to FC) p_DV -> t_RDS   (if the documents are incomplete, then we go to RDS) Then, after t_RDS, we have an arc to p_DV?

Then from p_P we do t_P again? That would be incorrect. Actually, we are overloading t_P. We should have: The transition t_P is the Payment activity. It should be done after we have either passed the approval step (if needed) or skipped it. So: In the skip branch: p_CA -> t_P   # but then t_P should output to p_N? In the approve branch: p_CA -> t_AP -> p_P -> t_P -> p_N But wait, we have two t_P? That is not allowed because transition names must be unique? Actually, in pm4py, transitions are identified by object. We can have two transitions with the same label? But we are creating one transition for each activity. So we have one t_P for the entire net. How do we connect? We have two input places to t_P: from the skip branch: p_CA -> t_P from the approve branch: p_P -> t_P But wait, in the approve branch, we have: p_CA -> t_AP -> p_P p_P -> t_P Then, t_P has two input arcs: one from p_CA (skip) and one from p_P (approve). Then, when we fire t_P, we remove one token from either p_CA or p_P? This is a conflict? But its non-deterministic? Alternatively, we can have two different transitions for payment? But the activity is the same: Payment. So we should have one transition. Well use one transition t_P with two input places: p_CA and p_P? Then, when a token is in p_CA (from the skip branch) and we fire t_P, we remove the token from p_CA and put one token in p_N. When a token is in p_P (from the approve branch) and we fire t_P, we remove the token from p_P and put one token in p_N. This works."

    "Text": "However, we have loops that might run indefinitely? But the process should eventually complete? We assume that the loops will terminate at some point (documents become complete, fraud check passes without needing more investigation). Well create the net step by step.

Actually, after we decide to do RDS (from p_DV to t_RDS), we need a place to wait for the RDS activity? Then after t_RDS, we go back to p_DV. Similarly, for II: we have a place p_II? But in the fraud check loop, after we decide to do II (from p_FC_decision to t_II), we need a place to wait for the II activity? Then after t_II, we go back to p_FC_decision. But note: in the model above, we didnt have a place between t_II and p_FC_decision? We have: t_II -> p_FC_decision So we dont need an intermediate place? We can go directly. However, we have: p_FC_decision -> t_II -> p_FC_decision   (so we can run FC again) This is acceptable. But note: we must create all the places. Alternatively, we can avoid having a separate place for the RDS waiting by having: p_DV -> t_RDS -> p_DV   (so we dont have a place in between) Similarly, for II: p_FC_decision -> t_II -> p_FC_decision Then we dont need p_II? And we dont need p_RDS? But note: we have transitions and places as states? Actually, in pm4py, we can have a transition without having a place in between? The semantics of Petri nets: a transition consumes from input places and produces to output places. So if we do: p_DV -> t_RDS -> p_DV This means that t_RDS does not change the state: it just fires and leaves the token in the same place? That is a loop? But that would be a self-loop? Actually, we can add an arc from t_RDS to p_DV? Then the token that was in p_DV is consumed by t_RDS and then one token is produced in p_DV? So the net is unchanged? However, that would allow the RDS to be done multiple times without leaving the place? But we want to run DV again after RDS? Actually, the RDS is a separate activity? Then we should have a place to wait for the RDS? Alternatively, we can model the entire process without places that have only one incoming and one outgoing? We can merge? But for clarity, well create a place for every state. However, in the model above, after t_RDS, we are going back to p_DV? So we can model without an intermediate place? But note: we have the transition t_RDS: it represents the activity of re-doing the document submission? So we need to have a place that enables t_RDS? And a place that represents the state after t_RDS? Actually, the state after t_RDS is the same as the state after DV? So we can use the same place p_DV. So we can do: p_DV -> t_RDS -> p_DV Similarly for II: p_FC_decision -> t_II -> p_FC_decision This is acceptable. So we dont need p_II and p_RDS as separate places? We can use the existing ones. Therefore, we have: Places: p_start p_CR p_DV p_FC_decision (this is the state after FC, waiting for decision) p_CA p_AP p_P p_N p_CL p_end But wait, we are using p_DV for both the state after DV and the state after RDS? That is, after RDS we are back to the state of waiting for the next step in the document verification? That is correct. Similarly, p_FC_decision is the state after FC and also the state after II? That is, after II we are back to the state where we can run FC again? That is correct."

But thats acceptable in the model. However, the problem says: after DV, if documents are incomplete, we do RDS and then come back to DV. So we are not going to FC until the documents are complete. So we have to model that when we are in p_DV, we have two choices: either we go to RDS or we go to FC. But the condition is not in the net. So we just leave it as a conflict. But note: we cannot have two arcs from p_DV to t_RDS and to t_FC without a condition? Actually, in the net, both transitions are enabled when there is a token in p_DV. Then the firing can be non-deterministic? But in reality, the condition is not modeled. So we have to assume that the net will be used in a context where the condition is known? Alternatively, we can model the document verification as having an output place that is the same for both outcomes? Then we have two transitions (t_RDS and t_FC) that conflict on the token in p_DV.
