Since the tolerance is less than 2 seconds, but wait: 2 seconds exactly? The requirement says if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them the same event. Wait, 2 seconds exactly would be 2.0 seconds difference. ... But maybe the problem allows up to 2 seconds. ... Let's assume that the tolerance is within 2 seconds (i.e., <= 2 seconds).
