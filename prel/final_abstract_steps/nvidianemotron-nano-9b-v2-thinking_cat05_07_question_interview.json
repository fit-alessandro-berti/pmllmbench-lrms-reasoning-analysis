What is the process for selecting and coordinating with the photographer and inspector, and how are their findings addressed if issues are found? 5. How does the digital marketing team determine the pricing strategy for each property, and how is this integrated into the internal systems? 6. What steps are taken during tenant screening beyond credit checks and employment verification, and how are references handled? 7. How are decisions made when multiple tenants are interested, and what factors influence lease term negotiations or discounts? 8. Can you describe the quality check and audit process, including who is involved and how compliance is ensured? 9. How are exceptions like special insurance requirements or custom lease clauses handled, and who manages these cases? 10. What is the typical timeline for each stage of the onboarding process, and how are delays or bottlenecks managed? 11. How are roles and responsibilities defined between the regional office, property managers, and other teams during the onboarding? 12. Are there any steps in the process that are automated versus manual, and how does that affect efficiency? 13. How is communication tracked and managed across different stakeholders, and what tools are used for this? 14. What happens if a property fails inspection, and what is the standard procedure for resolving such issues? 15. Are there any unique challenges or common exceptions that frequently arise during onboarding, and how are they typically addressed?"

Maybe add a question about how the process scales across multiple cities, but the original process mentions multiple cities, so maybe thats a good point. However, the user didnt mention scaling, so maybe not necessary unless its part of the process. Alternatively, ask about how the process varies by city or region. But the original process mentions regional offices, so maybe thats covered. But perhaps a question about regional differences could be useful. But the users main focus is on the process as described. So maybe stick to the given steps. I think the list I have is comprehensive. Let me check if any steps are missing. The process includes activation, tenant screening, lease finalization, and quality checks. All are covered."
