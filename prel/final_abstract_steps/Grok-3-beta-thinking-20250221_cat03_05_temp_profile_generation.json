For electronics components, it might be a few weeks to a couple of months. Let's assume an average of 30 days, with a standard deviation of 7 days. So, 30 * 86400 = 2592000 seconds, std dev 7 * 86400 = 604800 seconds. RC to QI: Receive Components to Quality Inspection. Once components are received, inspection might start immediately or after a short delay. Let's say average 1 day, std dev 0.5 days. So, 86400 seconds, std dev 43200 seconds. QI to CA: Quality Inspection to Component Assembly. If components pass inspection, assembly can start soon after. Maybe a few hours to a day. Let's say average 12 hours, std dev 6 hours. 12 hours = 43200 seconds, std dev 21600 seconds. Wait, actually, 12 hours is 12 * 3600 = 43200 seconds, yes. CA to PT: Component Assembly to Product Testing. After assembly, testing might be done immediately or after some preparation. Let's say average 1 day, std dev 0.5 days. 86400 seconds, std dev 43200 seconds. PT to PK: Product Testing to Packaging. If the product passes testing, packaging can follow quickly. Maybe a few hours. Average 6 hours, std dev 3 hours. 6 * 3600 = 21600 seconds, std dev 10800 seconds. PK to WS: Packaging to Warehouse Storage. Once packaged, moving to warehouse storage might take a short time, say a few hours. Average 4 hours, std dev 2 hours. 4 * 3600 = 14400 seconds, std dev 7200 seconds. WS to DT: Warehouse Storage to Distribution. The time in storage can vary greatly depending on demand and logistics. It could be days to weeks. Let's assume average 14 days, std dev 7 days. 14 * 86400 = 1209600 seconds, std dev 604800 seconds. DT to AS: Distribution to After-Sales Support. After-sales support starts after the product is delivered and might be triggered by customer issues, which can happen anytime after delivery. This is tricky to estimate. Perhaps it's better to consider the time from distribution to when support is typically needed, but since support can be ongoing, maybe it's not directly comparable. For simplicity, let's assume an average of 90 days, std dev 30 days. 90 * 86400 = 7776000 seconds, std dev 2592000 seconds. Wait, but actually, after-sales support might not be a direct follow-up in the same way as the other activities. It might be better to consider it as a separate process.
