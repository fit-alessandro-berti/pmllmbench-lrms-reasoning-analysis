    "Text": "Looking at the activities for the long cases: 2003: Multiple Request Additional Documents events (two times) 2005: Multiple Request Additional Documents events (three times) 2002: One Request Additional Documents event Ah, so the number of document requests seems to correlate with longer durations. High complexity cases require more documents, which takes more time."

    "Text": "So maybe Adjuster_Lisa is slower to follow up on document requests compared to Adjuster_Mike, leading to longer gaps between requests (as seen in 2005 vs 2003). Possible root causes: 1. High complexity claims inherently require more documentation, leading to more steps and longer durations. 2. Adjuster_Lisa may be less efficient in handling complex claims, leading to more document requests or longer wait times between requests. 3. Possible regional differences in customer responsiveness (but no data to confirm)."

    "Text": "Summary of findings: Cases 2003 and 2005 have significantly longer durations, both are high complexity. High complexity cases require more document requests, which adds time. Adjuster_Lisas high complexity case (2005) has more document requests and longer gaps between requests than Adjuster_Mikes high complexity case (2003). Region doesnt seem to be a major factor since both regions have one long case. Complexity is a clear factor: low complexity cases are fast, medium is slower, high is slowest."
