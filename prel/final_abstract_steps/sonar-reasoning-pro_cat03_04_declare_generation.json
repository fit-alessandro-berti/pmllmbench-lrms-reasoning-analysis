    "Text": "The scenario says each product idea goes through a series of steps, implying all are required. So existence might not be necessary here unless we have optional steps. Alternatively, maybe some steps like User Testing (UT) might not be required if lab testing suffices? The scenario says UT is part of the process, so perhaps all activities must exist."

    "Text": "If all activities are mandatory, then each would be in existence. But that might not be realistic—maybe some can be skipped depending on the case. However, according to the given scenario description, its a complex multi-department process with all listed activities as part of the steps. So perhaps all activities must exist."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In reality, some steps might repeat—like maybe multiple Design Drafts or Prototype Creations if iterations are needed. But the scenario describes a series of steps without mentioning iterations. So perhaps its a linear process where each activity happens once. So for exactly_one, include all activities: IG, DD, TFC, CE, PC, LT, UT, AG, MP, FL."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "The scenario lists the steps as: Idea Generation Design Draft Technical Feasibility Check Cost Evaluation Prototype Creation Laboratory Testing User Testing Approval Gate Marketing Plan Final Launch. So its a linear sequence as listed. So each step must follow the previous one."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "But succession implies both precedence and response. So for each step in the sequence from IG to FL, we can add succession constraints between consecutive activities. But maybe some steps can have alternative paths? The scenario doesnt mention any alternatives; its a straightforward process."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Alternatively, using chain succession would require one activity immediately followed by another. But according to the scenario description, its a series of steps in order. So chain succession could enforce that each step directly follows the previous one."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "However, real processes might have other activities in between or allow for some flexibility. Since its a complex multi-department process, maybe theres more parallelism or alternative routes not specified here. But given the information provided, modeling it as a strict sequence using chain succession might be appropriate."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So for chain succession between each consecutive pair: IG chain succession to DD; DD to TFC; TFC to CE; CE to PC; PC to LT; LT to UT; UT to AG; AG to MP; MP to FL."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "From DECLARE semantics: Chain Succession(A,B): Every occurrence of A must be immediately followed by B and every occurrence of B must be immediately preceded by A. Therefore using chainsuccession between consecutive pairs enforces strict sequence without any gaps or deviations."
