    "Text": "The bias is introduced through a policy that provides a slight upward adjustment to the overall score for applicants who either live in a certain local region or are members of well regarded community associations such as the Highland Civic Darts Club Such a policy seems to favor applicants who are long standing residents of the local region or who are part of recognized local community groups"

    "Text": "Identification of Bias 1 Geographic Favoritism Applicants who live in a certain local region receive a score adjustment aimed at rewarding community ties This implies that applicants who do not live in that region do not get this score adjustment and thus might be at a disadvantage 2 Membership in Specific Community Association Another part of the bias is based on membership in a specific local community association such as the Highland Civic Darts Club Those who voluntarily list membership in this club or other recognized local community groups also receive an upward score adjustment"

    "Text": "Disclosure and Transparency The policy mentions that the score adjustment for residing in a certain local region or being a part of a well regarded community association is not openly disclosed to applicants Lack of transparency can raise ethical concerns because applicants are unaware that their geographic location or community association membership might affect their loan application outcome"

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Justifiability The rationale for the policy is that community ties might indicate financial responsibility because long standing residents might be perceived as more stable and thus lower risk However this perception though not formally proven should be validated through data analysis If such a correlation is not rigorously proven the score adjustment might be based on an unverified assumption"

    "Text": "Underwriter Review The Manual Underwriter Review step mentions that underwriters interpret marginal data points in context and might view applications more favorably if there is a perceived community engagement This introduces a human element where underwriters might consciously or subconsciously favor applicants who they believe have stronger community ties based on the aforementioned policy"
