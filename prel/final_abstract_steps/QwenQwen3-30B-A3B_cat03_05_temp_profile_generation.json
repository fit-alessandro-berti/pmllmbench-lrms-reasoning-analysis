But the temporal profile considers the average time between the two activities regardless of the path. So the average time for SS to QI would be the average of all the times between SS and QI in all traces. But since I need to estimate, I can't compute exact numbers. So I have to make up plausible values. For example, SS to QI: Maybe 15 days (1296000 sec) with stdev 2 days (172800). Similarly, SS to CA: SS to OP (1 day), OP to RC (10 days), RC to QI (1 day), QI to CA (1 week). Total average 1+10+1+7=19 days. So 19 days (1641600 sec) with stdev 3 days (259200)."
