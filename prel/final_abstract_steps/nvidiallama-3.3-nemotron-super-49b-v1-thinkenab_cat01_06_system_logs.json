    "Text": "Wait the first QuarterlyReport FOCUS was at 085950 then after working on Document1 the user switches back at 090715 So is this a new case or resuming the old The first QuarterlyReport case had only one event FOCUS at 085950 then the user switched away Later at 090715 FOCUS again on QuarterlyReport types saves closes So this could be a second case for QuarterlyReport or the same case resumed But since the document was not closed initially only switched away maybe it's part of the same case However in the log the first FOCUS on QuarterlyReport is at 085950 then immediately switched to Document1 at 090000 So the QuarterlyReport case might have only that one FOCUS event which doesn't make sense as a complete case Then later at 090715 the user FOCUSes on QuarterlyReport again edits saves and closes So perhaps two separate cases for QuarterlyReport Or one case with a long gap This is complicated Given that the first FOCUS on QuarterlyReport is followed immediately by switching to Document1 it's possible that the user just opened QuarterlyReport briefly before starting Document1 Then later they work on it seriously So maybe two cases for QuarterlyReport one short initial FOCUS maybe not meaningful and a later editing session But the first case would have only a FOCUS event which might not be useful Alternatively ignore the first FOCUS as irrelevant and consider the later editing as the only QuarterlyReport case But the problem states to include all events So perhaps the first FOCUS is part of a QuarterlyReport case even if it's just one event But that's not very meaningful Alternatively maybe the initial FOCUS is part of a different case like a Startup case but that's not indicated Alternatively consider that the QuarterlyReport case starts at 085950 and ends at 090000 when the user switches away Then the later work at 090715 is another case But again two cases with minimal activity might not be useful Given the coherence requirement perhaps merge the two QuarterlyReport sessions into one case if they are related But without clear context it's hard"
