But looking at the tables, I see complications: Order Lines has multiple items per order, Delivery has multiple shipments, Invoice has multiple invoices per order, and Payments track payments per invoice."

    "Text": "Hmm... the tricky part will be handling one-to-many relationships without distorting the process flow. For example, when an order has two line items picked at different times, should that be two separate Items Picked events? The prompt says produce one event per activity if its meaningful - and since picking happens item-by-item in reality, I think yes. But for activities like Order Created, its clearly one event per order."

But if I make two events, does that imply the order wasn't fully picked until the last item? Probably yes - in warehouse operations, partial picking happens. So I'll create separate Item Picked events with item_id as attribute."
