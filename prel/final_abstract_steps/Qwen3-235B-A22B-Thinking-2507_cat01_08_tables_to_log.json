    "Text": "Okay, let me tackle this ERP data integration for process mining. The user wants a comprehensive event log with specific columns, and I need to carefully combine all these tables. First, I notice the core requirement is using order_id as Case ID. Thats straightforward - every event must link back to an order. But looking at the tables, I see complications: Order Lines has multiple items per order, Delivery has multiple shipments, Invoice has multiple invoices per order, and Payments track payments per invoice."

    "Text": "Hmm... the tricky part will be handling one-to-many relationships without distorting the process flow. For example, when an order has two line items picked at different times, should that be two separate Items Picked events? The prompt says produce one event per activity if its meaningful - and since picking happens item-by-item in reality, I think yes. But for activities like Order Created, its clearly one event per order. Ah, heres order 1001 with two items picked hours apart. If I collapse them into one event, Id lose the picking sequence detail. But if I make two events, does that imply the order wasnt fully picked until the last item? Probably yes - in warehouse operations, partial picking happens. So Ill create separate Item Picked events with item_id as attribute."
