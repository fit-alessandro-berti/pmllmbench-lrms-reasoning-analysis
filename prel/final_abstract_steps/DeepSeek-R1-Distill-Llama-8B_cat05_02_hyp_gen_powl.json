    "Text": "Generated hypotheses for anomalies: (1) The loop may exist due to design choices that allow re-evaluation but are incorrectly implemented. (2) Skipping N may be due to business rules allowing exceptions but not enforced in most cases. (3) Premature C may indicate weak constraints in the model, allowing incorrect sequences."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "To verify the hypotheses, I considered how database queries could expose evidence of anomalies. For instance, tracking multiple E and P occurrences for the loop. Checking skipped N occurrences after P would confirm the XOR anomaly. Comparing C timestamps with E and P would confirm premature C."
