Check inventory must always occur before Authorize payment 2. Authorize payment must occur before Package items 3. Package items must occur before Ship order 4. Ship order must never occur after Cancel order 5. Close order must be the final activity in all scenarios"

The cases reveal several critical order processing violations that could indicate systemic workflow issues or incomplete system implementation. The key observations highlight the importance of maintaining strict sequential integrity in order management processes. Each step must occur in a specific order to ensure proper inventory handling, payment authorization, and order fulfillment"
