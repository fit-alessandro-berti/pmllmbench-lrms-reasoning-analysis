    "Text": "Okay, lets start by understanding the normative process described. The main steps are: Receive order, check inventory, authorize payment, package items, ship, close. If inventory is insufficient, it goes to cancel and close. The key points are that authorization must come after check, payment after inventory, package after authorization, ship after packaging, and close at the end. Any deviations here would be violations."

    "Text": "Case 3: Same steps. Check, authorize, cancel, ship, close. Wait, here cancel comes before ship. The norm says that cancel should not be before packaging. So this is a violation. Also, cancel after authorization? Wait, in the description, authorization comes after check and before packaging. Here, authorize comes before cancel. Thats a violation. Also, after cancel, theres a ship. The norm says that after cancellation, theres no fulfillment steps. So this is a violation."

    "Text": "Case 4: Cancel order is before ship. Again, cancel after authorization? Wait, in the process, authorization comes after check and before packaging. Here, authorize is before cancel. So thats a violation. And after cancel, theres a ship, but according to the norm, after cancellation there should be no fulfillment steps. So this is a violation."

    "Text": "So the violations are in cases 3, 4, 5. Let me check again. Case 3: Authorize payment before cancel. So authorization comes before cancel. Thats a violation. Also, after cancel, theres ship. But according to the norm, after cancellation, there should be no steps for fulfillment. So this is a violation. Case 4: Cancel order before ship. And after cancel, ship. So again, cancel after authorization? Wait, authorization comes before cancel here. So thats a violation. And after cancel, ship, which is not allowed. Case 5: Authorize payment before check. Thats a violation. So the violations are cases 3, 4, 5. Each of these shows a deviation from the norm. For example, in case 3, cancel is after authorization, which is incorrect. In case 4, cancel comes before ship, which is wrong. In case 5, authorize before check, which is wrong. Now, to explain each violation. For each case, reference the textual description. For case 3, the norm says authorization after check, so cancel after authorization is incorrect. Similarly, case 4: cancel after authorization, and after cancel, ship. So thats a violation. Case 5: authorize before check, which is not allowed. So the answer would list these cases as violations, explaining each with the given text."
