    "Text": "Analyzes the sequential logic of the process to determine that places in the Petri net represent states between transitions, such as after CR, before DV, etc. Deduces that transitions are labeled with activities performed within the process and loops are to be modeled using specific transitions (RDS for DV loop, II for FC loop)."
