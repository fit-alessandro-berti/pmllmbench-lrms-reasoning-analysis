So if we take the cancel_subtree, we have: cancel_order then close_order, and then after the xor_node, we have another close_order? That would lead to two close_order events in that branch."

The root is a sequence:   1. receive_order  2. check_inventory  3. xor_node (either branch)  4. close_order So any trace must start with receive_order, then check_inventory, then one of the two branches from xor_node, then close_order. Case 1: successful branch.  The successful_subtree is a parallel (AND) of authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order. In process trees, parallel means all permutations of these three activities are allowed, but they must all occur exactly once, and they can interleave arbitrarily."

    "Text": "So after check_inventory, we have any ordering of authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order (all three must occur), and then close_order.  So traces like:      receive_order, check_inventory, authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order, close_order      receive_order, check_inventory, authorize_payment, ship_order, package_items, close_order      etc.  All these seem valid from a domain perspective? But note: in a typical order-to-cash, you might need to authorize payment before shipping, but the parallel allows shipping before authorization. That might be a problem."

    "Text": "Trace: Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, Cancel_Order, Close_Order, Close_Order This trace is accepted by the model because: - Receive_Order is first. - Check_Inventory is second. - Then xor_node: we take the cancel_subtree which is a sequence of Cancel_Order and Close_Order, so we get Cancel_Order then Close_Order. - Then the root sequence requires another Close_Order after xor_node, so we get an additional Close_Order. But according to domain knowledge, after an order is canceled, it should be closed exactly once. Having two close events is redundant and might indicate an error."
