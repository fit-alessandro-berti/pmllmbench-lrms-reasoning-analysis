We can consider each document or task as a case. However, note that the user switches between different applications and documents. We can group events by the document (Window) and application (App) if it makes sense as a coherent unit of work. Let's look at the log and see what documents are being worked on: - Quarterly_Report.docx (Microsoft Word) - Document1.docx (Microsoft Word) - Email - Inbox (Google Chrome) -> This is about handling an email about the Annual Meeting. - Report_Draft.pdf (Adobe Acrobat) - Budget_2024.xlsx (Microsoft Excel)"

Also, note that the user returns to Document1.docx after working on the budget. Let's define cases by the document (or window) and the application, but note that the same document might be worked on in multiple sessions. However, in this log, we see two sessions for Document1.docx: one at the beginning and one after the budget. But note that the user saves and then later reopens the same document? Actually, the user never closes Document1.docx until after the second session. So we can consider the entire interaction with Document1.docx as one case? But there is a break where the user works on other things. Alternatively, we can define a case as a continuous work on a document without switching to another document (or with a gap of more than a certain time?). However, for process mining, we want to capture the entire lifecycle of a document or task. So let's define: Case ID: We can use the Window (document name) and App as the case identifier, but note that the same document might be worked on in multiple sessions. However, in this log, the same document (Document1.docx) is worked on in two separate sessions (with interruptions). We have two options: Option 1: Consider each continuous work on a document as a separate case. But then we break the same document into multiple cases, which might not be desirable if we want to see the entire history of the document. Option 2: Consider each document (by name and application) as a case, and then the events are ordered by time. This would mean that the case for Document1.docx would have events at 09:00, 09:00:30, 09:01:00, 09:01:15, then later at 09:06:15, 09:06:30, and 09:07:00. This is acceptable because the case would show the entire history of working on that document."

We can see that the user closes Document1.docx and then starts working on Quarterly_Report.docx. So we have two distinct documents. Let's list the cases we can identify: - Case 1: Document1.docx (Microsoft Word) -> from 08:59:50 (FOCUS) until 09:07:00 (CLOSE) But note: the user switches away and then comes back. We are considering the entire lifecycle of the document from first open to close. - Case 2: Email - Inbox (Google Chrome) -> from 09:01:45 (SWITCH to Chrome) until 09:03:20 (Send Email). Then the user switches away. There is no explicit close, but we can consider the case as the email handling task. - Case 3: Report_Draft.pdf (Adobe Acrobat) -> from 09:04:00 (SWITCH to Acrobat) until 09:04:45 (HIGHLIGHT). Then the user switches away. - Case 4: Budget_2024.xlsx (Microsoft Excel) -> from 09:05:00 (FOCUS) until 09:05:45 (SAVE). Then the user switches away. - Case 5: Quarterly_Report.docx (Microsoft Word) -> from 09:07:15 (FOCUS) until 09:08:15 (CLOSE) But note: the first event is FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50, but then the user immediately switches to Document1.docx. So we have two distinct sessions for Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, the first event is just a focus, but then the user starts working on Document1. Then at the end, the user works on Quarterly_Report.docx again. So we can consider the case for Quarterly_Report.docx as starting at 09:07:15 and ending at 09:08:15. However, note that the first FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx at 08:59:50 is followed by a FOCUS on Document1.docx at 09:00:00. So the user didn't do any activity on Quarterly_Report.docx in the first session. We can ignore that first event for the case of Quarterly_Report.docx? Or we can include it as an Open event."

    "Text": "Let's think about the lifecycle of a document: - Open -> Edit -> Save -> Close We see that for Document1.docx, the user opens (FOCUS) at 09:00:00, then types (edits), then saves, then later edits again, saves again, and then closes. For Quarterly_Report.docx, we have two FOCUS events: one at 08:59:50 and one at 09:07:15. The first one doesn't lead to any edit, so we can consider the case for Quarterly_Report.docx starting at 09:07:15. But note: the first FOCUS might be the user opening the document, but then switching away without doing anything. We can consider that as an aborted session? Or we can include it as part of the case. However, since the user didn't do any activity, it might not be useful. Let's define the cases by the document (Window) and consider the events in chronological order. We'll assign a Case ID by the document name and application, but note that the same document name in the same application is the same case. We have: - Case1: Document1.docx (Microsoft Word) - Case2: Email - Inbox (Google Chrome) -> but note: the window title is Email - Inbox, and the user is handling an email. We can consider this as a case for the email thread about the Annual Meeting. - Case3: Report_Draft.pdf (Adobe Acrobat) - Case4: Budget_2024.xlsx (Microsoft Excel) - Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx (Microsoft Word) Now, let's assign events to cases: Case1 (Document1.docx): - 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, FOCUS - 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, TYPING - 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, TYPING - 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z, SAVE - 2024-12-11T09:06:15.000Z, TYPING - 2024-12-11T09:06:30.000Z, SAVE - 2024-12-11T09:07:00.000Z, CLOSE Case2 (Email - Inbox): - 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, SWITCH (to Chrome) -> but note: the SWITCH event is from Word to Chrome. We can consider the start of the case as the SWITCH to Chrome, but then we have: - 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, CLICK (Open Email) - 2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z, SCROLL - 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z, CLICK (Reply) - 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z, TYPING - 2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z, CLICK (Send) But note: the SWITCH event is not directly an event of the case, but it marks the transition. We can either include the SWITCH as an event (like Start Email Handling) or not. However, the SWITCH event is about leaving one app and going to another. We can consider the events in the email case as: - 2024-12-11T09:02:00.000Z, Open Email - 2024-12-11T09:02:30.000Z, Scroll Email - 2024-12-11T09:02:45.000Z, Reply to Email - 2024-12-11T09:03:00.000Z, Compose Reply - 2024-12-11T09:03:20.000Z, Send Email But note: the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 is the one that leads to the email, so we can include it as the start of the case? But then the case would have a SWITCH event, which is not a direct activity on the email. Alternatively, we can define the case for the email by the email subject? But we don't have a clear subject, only the window title and the action of opening an email about Annual Meeting. Let's do: - Case1: Document1.docx - Case2: Annual Meeting Email (well create a case ID Annual_Meeting_Email) - Case3: Report_Draft.pdf - Case4: Budget_2024.xlsx - Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx"

We can keep the same activity name for each type. For the email case: - CLICK (Open Email) -> Open Email - SCROLL -> Read Email (assuming scrolling is part of reading) - CLICK (Reply to Email) -> Start Reply - TYPING -> Compose Reply - CLICK (Send Email) -> Send Reply For the PDF: - SCROLL -> Review Document - HIGHLIGHT -> Highlight Text For the Excel: - FOCUS -> Open Spreadsheet - TYPING -> Edit Spreadsheet - SAVE -> Save Spreadsheet For Quarterly_Report.docx: - FOCUS -> Open Document - TYPING -> Edit Document - SAVE -> Save Document - CLOSE -> Close Document"

    "Text": "Now, let's build the event log table. Well have columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp Well go through each event in the log and assign it to a case (if it belongs to one) and map the activity. Let's list the events and decide: 1. 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx - This is the first event for Quarterly_Report.docx, but note that the user immediately switches to Document1.docx. We can consider this as an Open Document for Quarterly_Report.docx? But then the user doesn't do anything until later. We can either: a) Ignore this event because the user didn't perform any meaningful activity (like editing) and then switched away. b) Include it as the start of the case for Quarterly_Report.docx. But note: at the end, the user works on Quarterly_Report.docx and then closes it. So we have two separate sessions? We can consider the entire Quarterly_Report.docx as one case, but then we have two periods of work. However, the first session only has a FOCUS and then the user leaves. We can consider the first FOCUS as an Open and then the second session as a Resume or just consider the entire case from first open to last close. However, in process mining, we want to see the entire lifecycle of a case (document). So we can include the first FOCUS as the start of the case, and then the later events as part of the same case. So for Quarterly_Report.docx, we have: - 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z: Open Document - 2024-12-11T09:07:15.000Z: Resume Document? Or just Open again? But note, the document was already open? We don't have an explicit close until the end. Alternatively, we can consider the first FOCUS as the open and then the user switches away (so the document is still open) and then comes back. So we can have: Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx - 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z: Open Document - 2024-12-11T09:07:45.000Z: Edit Document (because the user starts typing) -> but wait, the user types at 09:07:45, so we can have: - 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z: Open Document - 2024-12-11T09:07:45.000Z: Edit Document - 2024-12-11T09:08:00.000Z: Save Document - 2024-12-11T09:08:15.000Z: Close Document But note: the user did not do anything between 08:59:50 and 09:07:15? We don't have events, but the document was open and then the user came back to it. We can also note that the user might have been interrupted. So we can keep the entire case. However, the first FOCUS event for Quarterly_Report.docx is at 08:59:50 and then the next event for the same document is at 09:07:15 (FOCUS again). We can consider the first FOCUS as the open and then the second FOCUS as a resume? But we don't have a clear resume event. Let's keep it simple and use the same activity names for the same type of event, regardless of whether it's the first time or not. So for Quarterly_Report.docx, we have two FOCUS events? We can map FOCUS to Open Document only the first time, and then for the second time, we can map it to Resume Document? But we don't have a standard for that. Alternatively, we can map FOCUS to Open Document only when it is the first event for that document? But then we don't know if the document was already open. Since we are dealing with a log that doesn't have explicit open and close (except when we see CLOSE) we can define: - The first FOCUS on a document that hasn't been seen before -> Open Document - Subsequent FOCUS on the same document (without a close in between) -> Switch to Document But note: the user might have multiple documents open and switch between them. We don't have explicit open and close for all. However, in this log, we see CLOSE events for Document1.docx and Quarterly_Report.docx. Let's define: - If we see a FOCUS on a document that we haven't seen before (or after a CLOSE) then it's Open Document. Otherwise, if we see a FOCUS and the document was already open (i.e., we have seen a FOCUS or other events without a CLOSE) then we can map FOCUS to Resume Document. But note: the log does not have an explicit open event. The first event we see is FOCUS. We can assume that FOCUS means the document is being brought to the front, so it is already open. So we can map FOCUS to Switch to Document and then when we see a TYPING or other activity, we know the user is working on it. However, for simplicity, let's map: - FOCUS: Start Working on Document (or Open Document if we assume that FOCUS is the first event for a document). Let's look at the events for each case and map the activities: Case1: Document1.docx - 09:00:00 FOCUS -> Open Document - 09:00:30 TYPING -> Edit Document - 09:01:00 TYPING -> Edit Document - 09:01:15 SAVE -> Save Document - 09:06:15 TYPING -> Edit Document - 09:06:30 SAVE -> Save Document - 09:07:00 CLOSE -> Close Document Case2: Annual_Meeting_Email - 09:02:00 CLICK (Open Email) -> Open Email - 09:02:30 SCROLL -> Read Email - 09:02:45 CLICK (Reply to Email) -> Start Reply - 09:03:00 TYPING -> Compose Reply - 09:03:20 CLICK (Send Email) -> Send Reply Case3: Report_Draft.pdf - 09:04:00 SWITCH -> This is a switch from Chrome to Acrobat. We can consider the start of the case as the SWITCH? But note, the SWITCH event is not directly an activity on the PDF. We don't have a FOCUS event for the PDF? Actually, the SWITCH event is the one that brings the PDF to focus. So we can map the SWITCH event to Open Document for the PDF? But note, the SWITCH event is from Chrome to Acrobat, and the window is Report_Draft.pdf. So we can consider the SWITCH as the start of the case for the PDF. So for Case3: - 09:04:00 SWITCH -> Open Document - 09:04:30 SCROLL -> Review Document - 09:04:45 HIGHLIGHT -> Highlight Text But note: the SWITCH event is not specific to the PDF. It is a transition from one app to another. We can consider the first event that involves the document as the start. Alternatively, we can note that the user switches to Acrobat and the window is Report_Draft.pdf. So we can map: - 09:04:00 SWITCH -> Start Review (for the PDF) Let's map: - 09:04:00 SWITCH -> Open Document (for the PDF) Case4: Budget_2024.xlsx - 09:05:00 FOCUS -> Open Spreadsheet - 09:05:15 TYPING -> Edit Spreadsheet - 09:05:30 TYPING -> Edit Spreadsheet - 09:05:45 SAVE -> Save Spreadsheet Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx - 08:59:50 FOCUS -> Open Document - 09:07:15 FOCUS -> We already have an open? But note, the user switched away and then came back. We can map the second FOCUS to Resume Document? Or we can just map both to Open Document and then note that the case has two open events? That might be confusing. Alternatively, we can consider the entire case from the first FOCUS to the CLOSE. So we have: - 08:59:50 FOCUS -> Open Document - 09:07:45 TYPING -> Edit Document - 09:08:00 SAVE -> Save Document - 09:08:15 CLOSE -> Close Document But note: the user did not do anything between 08:59:50 and 09:07:15? We don't have events, but the document was open. We can consider the second FOCUS as a Resume activity. Let's define: - The first FOCUS event for a document (case) -> Open Document - Subsequent FOCUS events for the same document (case) -> Resume Document So for Quarterly_Report.docx, we have: - 08:59:50: Open Document - 09:07:15: Resume Document - 09:07:45: Edit Document - 09:08:00: Save Document - 09:08:15: Close Document But note: we don't have a TYPING event after the first FOCUS? So the first FOCUS is just an open and then the user switches away. Then later, the user resumes the document, edits, saves, and closes. This seems more accurate. So we'll map: - First FOCUS on a document (case) -> Open Document - Subsequent FOCUS on the same document (case) -> Resume Document"

    "Text": "Now, let's build the event log: Well create a table with: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp Well go event by event and assign: 1. 2024-12-11T08:59:50.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Quarterly_Report.docx     - Case ID: Quarterly_Report.docx     - Activity Name: Open Document 2. 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z, FOCUS, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx     - Case ID: Document1.docx     - Activity Name: Open Document 3. 2024-12-11T09:00:30.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx     - Case ID: Document1.docx     - Activity Name: Edit Document 4. 2024-12-11T09:01:00.000Z, TYPING, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx     - Case ID: Document1.docx     - Activity Name: Edit Document 5. 2024-12-11T09:01:15.000Z, SAVE, App=Microsoft Word, Window=Document1.docx     - Case ID: Document1.docx     - Activity Name: Save Document 6. 2024-12-11T09:01:45.000Z, SWITCH, FromApp=Microsoft Word, FromWindow=Document1.docx, ToApp=Google Chrome, ToWindow=Email - Inbox     - This event is a transition. We can assign it to the case of the target application? But note, we are defining cases by document.     We are going to assign this event to the email case? But the email case hasn't started yet? We don't have an event for the email case until the next CLICK.     Alternatively, we can note that this SWITCH event is the start of the email case? But the email case is about the Annual Meeting, and the user hasn't opened the email yet.     We can decide that the email case starts with the SWITCH to Chrome? But then the activity would be Start Email Handling or something.     However, to keep the event log clean, we can ignore the SWITCH events and only consider the events that are directly on the document (or email). But note, the SWITCH event is the one that brings the email to focus.     Let's map the SWITCH event to the email case and call it Open Email Client or Switch to Email. But then we have:        Case2: Annual_Meeting_Email          - 09:01:45: Switch to Email     But then we have:        - 09:02:00: Open Email (the specific email about Annual Meeting)     But note: the SWITCH event is from Word to Chrome, and the window is Email - Inbox. So we can map:          - 09:01:45: Open Email Inbox     But then the user opens the specific email. So we can have:          - Open Email Inbox          - Open Email          - Read Email          - Start Reply          - Compose Reply          - Send Reply     Alternatively, we can consider the entire sequence from switching to Chrome until switching away as the email case.     We have:          - 09:01:45: SWITCH -> Start Email Task     Let's map:          - 09:01:45: Start Email Task (or just ignore the SWITCH and start with the Open Email)     I think it's better to ignore the SWITCH events and only consider the events that are directly on the document (or email). But then we lose the context of how the user switched to the email.     Alternatively, we can include the SWITCH events as activities in the case of the target document? But note, the SWITCH event is about leaving one and going to another.     Given the ambiguity, let's not include the SWITCH events as activities in the event log. We'll only include:        - For document cases: FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLOSE, etc.     But then for the email case, we don't have a FOCUS event? We have a CLICK event to open the email.     We can define the email case as starting with the CLICK to open the email and ending with the CLICK to send the reply.     So we'll skip the SWITCH event for the email case.     Similarly, for the PDF case, we have a SWITCH event at 09:04:00. We can skip that and start with the SCROLL event? But then we don't have an open event for the PDF.     Let's reconsider:     We want to capture the process of how the user handles each task (document or email). The SWITCH event is not part of the task, it's a transition.     So we'll only include events that are directly on the document (or email) and ignore the SWITCH events.     Then the email case would be:        - 09:02:00: Open Email        - 09:02:30: Read Email        - 09:02:45: Start Reply        - 09:03:00: Compose Reply        - 09:03:20: Send Reply     Similarly, for the PDF case, we have:        - 09:04:30: Review Document (from SCROLL)        - 09:04:45: Highlight Text     But then we don't have an event that marks the start of the PDF case? We can consider the first event on the PDF (the SCROLL) as the start.     But note: the user switched to the PDF at 09:04:00, but we are ignoring the SWITCH. Then the PDF case starts at 09:04:30 with Review Document. But then we don't have an Open for the PDF.     Alternatively, we can use the SWITCH event as the start of the case for the PDF? But then we are including a SWITCH event as an activity.     Let's include the SWITCH events as the start of a case when there is no other event that marks the start (like a FOCUS). But note, the SWITCH event for the PDF is the first event that involves the PDF. So we can map:        Case3: Report_Draft.pdf          - 09:04:00: Open Document (from the SWITCH event)     We can do:        - For the email case, we don't have a FOCUS, so we use the SWITCH event as the start? But then the SWITCH event is not in the email case? It is a transition from Word to Chrome.     Given the complexity, let's define:        - For document-based cases (Word, Excel, PDF): the first event that involves the document (whether FOCUS or SWITCH) is mapped to Open Document.     So for the PDF case:        - 09:04:00: Open Document (from SWITCH)     Similarly, for the email case, we don't have a SWITCH event that goes to the specific email, only to the inbox. So we can use the CLICK to open the email as the start? But then we don't capture the time the user spent in the inbox before opening the email.     Alternatively, we can define the email case as starting when the user switches to Chrome (because the window is Email - Inbox) and then the subsequent events until switching away.     Let's try to define the cases by the window title and application, and include all events that have that window and application.     Then for the email case, the window is Email - Inbox and the application is Google Chrome. So we can assign:        Case2: Email - Inbox (Google Chrome)          - 09:01:45: SWITCH -> Open Email Inbox          - 09:02:00: CLICK -> Open Email          - 09:02:30: SCROLL -> Read Email          - 09:02:45: CLICK -> Start Reply          - 09:03:00: TYPING -> Compose Reply          - 09:03:20: CLICK -> Send Reply     But note: the window title remains Email - Inbox even when the user is replying? That might be the case because the reply window might be embedded in the inbox.     So we can assign the email case as:        Case ID: Email - Inbox (Google Chrome)        - 09:01:45: SWITCH -> Open Email Inbox        - 09:02:00: CLICK -> Open Email about Annual Meeting        - 09:02:30: SCROLL -> Read Email        - 09:02:45: CLICK -> Start Reply        - 09:03:00: TYPING -> Compose Reply        - 09:03:20: CLICK -> Send Reply     But then the case ID is not unique for different emails? But in this log, we only see one email being handled.     Given the time, let's proceed with the case IDs as:        Case1: Document1.docx (Microsoft Word)        Case2: Email - Inbox (Google Chrome)        Case3: Report_Draft.pdf (Adobe Acrobat)        Case4: Budget_2024.xlsx (Microsoft Excel)        Case5: Quarterly_Report.docx (Microsoft Word)     And then we map the activities as described.     Well produce the event log in the following table."
