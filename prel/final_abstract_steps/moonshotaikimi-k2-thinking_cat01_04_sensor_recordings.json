The data is from a single machine (M1) with various sensor readings over time 2. I need to identify patterns/phases in the readings 3. Assign meaningful manufacturing activity labels (like Cutting, Assembling, Welding, etc.) 4. Provide rationale for each label Let me examine the event log carefully:"

    "Text": "Wait, let me reconsider the Assembling Parts phase. The stable tool position with material flow might actually be Material Positioning or Feeding rather than assembly. But assembly could involve feeding parts into position. Let me think about typical manufacturing processes. Actually, looking at the pattern more carefully: - Events 4-6: High material flow, tool moving, high vibration - this is clearly some kind of material processing (Cutting) - Events 7-8: Reduced flow, stable tool, moderate vibration - this could be Positioning for Welding - Event 9: No flow, high temp/vibration, stable tool - this is clearly Welding - Events 11-12: Low flow, tool moving, low vibration - this could be Packaging or Unloading"
