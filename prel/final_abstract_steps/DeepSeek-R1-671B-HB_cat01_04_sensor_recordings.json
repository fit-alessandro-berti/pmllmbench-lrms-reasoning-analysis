    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the data provided in the event log. Each event has a timestamp, machine ID, and several sensor readings. The goal is to group these events into phases that correspond to manufacturing activities like cutting, welding, etc. I'll start by looking at the sequence of events for Machine M1, as all events here are from M1. Let me list out the sensor readings over time to spot any patterns or changes."

    "Text": "Looking at the Temperature column: Events 1-3 start at around 20°C, then jump to 50°C in event 4, keep rising to 58°C by event 6, drop to 40°C in event 7, then spike to 80°C in event 9 before dropping again. So there are significant temperature changes here. Pressure starts at 1 bar, goes up to 1.5 in event 5, then 2 in event 7, stays there until event 9, then drops back to 1. Vibration is 0 initially, then jumps to 30 Hz at event 4, peaks at 38, then drops to 10, then spikes to 50 in event 9. Material Flow is 0 for the first three events, goes to 5 in events 4-6, drops to 2 in events 7-8, then 0 again in 9-10, then 1 in 11-12. Tool Position is 0 at first, moves to 5, 7, 10, then 15 from event 7 onwards, then 20 in 11-12, back to 0. Energy usage is low initially (0.4-0.5), jumps to 2-3 kWh during the temperature rise, then 5 in event 9, and back down."

    "Text": "Now, let's try to group these. Events 1-3: low temp, no vibration, no material flow, tool at 0, low energy. This seems like an idle state or standby. Then events 4-6: temp increases, higher vibration, material flow starts, tool moves, energy up. Possibly an active process like cutting or welding. Then events 7-8: temp drops a bit, pressure and vibration lower but material flow continues, tool position is 15. Then event 9: temp spikes high, vibration jumps again, material flow stops, energy peaks. Maybe welding or another high-heat process. Events 10-12: temp and vibration drop, tool moves to 20, some material flow. Maybe cooling or inspection. Then events 13-15 return to initial state."

    "Text": "Cutting phase (4-6): temp 50-58, pressure increases to 1.5, vibration 30-38, material flow 5, tool moving from 5 to 10mm, energy 2-3 kWh. This makes sense as material is being cut with high flow rate. Assembling (7-8): temp drops to 40, pressure 2, vibration 10, material flow 2, tool at 15mm. Lower temp and vibration, maybe parts are being assembled with some pressure (2 bar). Lower material flow, maybe parts being aligned. Welding (event 9): Temp spikes to 80, vibration 50, material flow 0 (no material moving), tool position same as assembling (15mm?), energy 5kWh. High temp and vibration for welding, energy surge. Then events 10-12: temp drops to 30-25, vibration 1-5, material flow 0 then 1, tool moves to 20mm. Could be moving the welded product to inspection or packaging. Lower energy use here. Maybe during inspection, there's some movement (tool position change) and minimal material flow."

    "Text": "Wait, but event 10-12 have material flow 0 then 1. Maybe after welding, they stop material flow (event 9-10), then resume a little in 11-12. Maybe that's moving the product out, hence packaging. So events 11-12 with material flow 1 and tool moving to 20mm could be packaging. Then events 10 is a transition."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Cutting: High temp, vibration, material flow. Consistent with cutting operations where material is being fed (flow) and tool is moving. Assembling: Moderate temp, steady pressure, lower vibration, material flow reduced. Parts are being put together under pressure, with the tool positioned to hold components. Welding: Highest temp, energy spike, vibration spike. Material flow stops as welding doesn't require feeding. The tool remains in position to fuse parts. Packaging: Temperature cools, material flow resumes at a lower rate to move the product into packaging, tool moves to position for handling. Low energy compared to active processes."
