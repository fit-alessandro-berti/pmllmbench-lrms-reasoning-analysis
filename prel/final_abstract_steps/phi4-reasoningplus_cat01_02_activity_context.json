The first \"Verify Documents\" seems to be performed when documents are submitted via portal, but since it's incomplete, maybe not valid? Actually check context: for first Verify Documents, timestamp 09:20, agent checks identity documents, then a call is made because verification is incomplete, then customer uploads additional document and then re-checking of documents takes place. So we can rename these two \"Verify Documents\" events as something like \"Initial Document Verification\" vs \"Reverification after Additional Submission\"."

Context: \"Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy.\" So this is not about document issues but about clarifying account details.\n-- Second \"Call Customer\": 09:50 by FrontlineAgent, context: \"Follow-up call to confirm adjustments made.\" So that's a follow-up after an adjustment.\n\nCase C003:\n- \"Call Customer\" at 11:50, BranchOfficer.
