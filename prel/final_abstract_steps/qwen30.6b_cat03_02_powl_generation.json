First, I need to understand all the steps and how they can be represented with the given classes. Starting with step 1: verifying the Service Request. Once verified, contract setup (CS) must be done. So, the process starts with a transition that checks the SR. Then CS must be done. But how do I model that? Maybe a transition that adds a dependency. Then, after CS, DA and ACI can be done in parallel. Since they don't have ordering constraints, their transitions can be linked with a PartialOrder."

Also, when BNC is followed by D&R, maybe there's a transition that adds an edge from BNC to D&R, and then from D&R to BNC again? Or is it a loop that repeats?"
