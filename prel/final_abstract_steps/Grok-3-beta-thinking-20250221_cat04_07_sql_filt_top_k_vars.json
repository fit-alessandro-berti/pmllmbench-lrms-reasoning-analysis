Let me try to understand what is being asked here.\n\nWe have an event log in a table called event_log with columns case_id, activity, and timestamp. Each row represents an event in a process instance, identified by case_id. The timestamp tells us when each activity happened.\n\nFirst, I need to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id, ordered by the timestamp. So for each case, I want to get the list of activities in the order they occurred.\n\nThen, I need to group the cases by their complete activity sequence. That means cases that have the exact same sequence of activities will be grouped together. Each unique sequence is called a process variant.\n\nNext, I have to count how many cases correspond to each variant and find the top K variants based on their frequency, meaning the number of cases that follow that variant.\n\nFinally, I need to return all the events from the original event log that belong only to the cases that are part of these top K variants. So, any case that doesn't match one of the top K variants should be excluded from the final result."
