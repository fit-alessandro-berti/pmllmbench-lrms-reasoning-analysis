But the scenario says: The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So we need to model a choice. However, note that the scenario does not specify an activity for when the amount is below the threshold. So we can model two transitions after CA: one for Approval AP and one for bypassing approval lets call it Auto-Approval or just skip to payment. But the scenario only lists AP. Alternatively, we can have a silent transition no label for the bypass, or we can model a condition in the net."

Alternatively, we can have a transition labeled Approval only when its needed, and when not needed, we have an unlabeled invisible transition that just moves the token. But note: the scenario says The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold.

Actually, we have two transitions: AP and tau. So we have two arcs from p_after_CA to each of these transitions? No, we have two transitions, so we need two outgoing arcs from the place p_after_CA: one to AP and one to tau. But that would be a choice at the place. Alternatively, we can have two separate places? But that would be unnecessary. We can have a place that has two outgoing arcs to two transitions. So: Place p_after_CA has two outgoing arcs: one to AP and one to tau invisible transition.

Well use the following names for transitions with labels as described: CR: Claim Registration DV: Document Verification RDS: Re-Document Submission FC: Fraud Check II: In-depth Investigation CA: Claim Assessment AP: Approval P: Payment N: Notification CL: Closure We also have an invisible transition tau for the bypass after CA.
