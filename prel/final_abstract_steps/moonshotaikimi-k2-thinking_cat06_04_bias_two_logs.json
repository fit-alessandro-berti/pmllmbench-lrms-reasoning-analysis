CommunityGroup attribute: Group A has no community group affiliation (None), while Group B members can belong to Highland Civic Darts Club which confers advantages. 3. ScoreAdjustment: This is the most critical bias indicator. Group B members in the Highland Civic Darts Club receive a +10 score boost, which is NOT applied to any Group A members.

    "Text": "How bias manifests: Direct score manipulation: The +10 Community Boost is exclusively applied to Group B, creating an artificial advantage. Intersectional effect: The bias is based on a combination of LocalResident=TRUE AND CommunityGroup affiliation, but since Group A has no residents and no community affiliations, its excluded from benefits entirely. Threshold effects: The boost pushes marginal cases (like U003s 695705) above the approval threshold while comparable Group A cases (P002 with 710) are rejected. Resource allocation: Different rules engines are applied based on group membership."
