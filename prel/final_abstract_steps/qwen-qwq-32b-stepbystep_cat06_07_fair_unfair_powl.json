But in the POWL model, the SkillAssessment is an activity, and the threshold check would determine the next steps, but since it's part of the assessment's score, maybe that's handled in the activity's logic. Since the problem doesn't mention branching based on skill scores except disqualification, perhaps the SkillAssessment is followed by the next steps only if they pass. But in the POWL model, activities are executed in order, so maybe the SkillAssessment is just a step, and those who don't meet the threshold are excluded from proceeding. But the model should represent the process flow, not the outcome. Hmm, perhaps the SkillAssessment is an activity, and only those who pass proceed further.
