So the loop will always execute at least once if the initial test is done and the results are abnormal. But in the problem statement, the loop starts only if the initial test results are abnormal. So perhaps the initial test (CE or FBP) is followed by a loop that conditionally repeats. But since process trees don't have conditions, the loop is structured such that the body is executed once (SC and treatment), then the loop_part (RDT) is done, and if the condition is met (abnormal), the loop repeats. But how to enforce that the loop is only entered if the initial test is abnormal. Hmm, perhaps the problem statement implies that after the initial test, the loop is mandatory if abnormal. So the initial test is followed by the loop, which must execute at least once if the condition is true. But since process trees don't have conditional gates, the loop is structured as * (body, loop_part), which means the body is executed once, then optionally the loop_part and body again. So if the initial test is abnormal, the loop body (SC and treatment) is executed once, then the loop_part (RDT) is executed.
