    "Text": "Okay, let's see. I need to analyze this customer support ticket resolution event log to find which cases are taking longer than average and figure out why. Alright, first step is probably to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The resolution time would be from when the ticket was received to when it was closed. Let me go through each case one by one. Starting with Case 101: Received at 2024-03-01 08:00, closed at 10:15. So from 8am to 10:15am. That's 2 hours and 15 minutes. Let me check the timestamps again. Yes, 8:00 to 10:15 is 2h15m. Case 102: Received at 08:05, closed at 09:15 on March 2nd. Wait, the close is on March 2nd at 9:15. So from March 1 8:05 to March 2 9:15. Let's calculate that. From 8:05 March 1 to 8:05 March 2 is 24 hours, then plus 1 hour 10 minutes more? Wait, no. Wait, from March 1 8:05 to March 2 8:05 is exactly 24 hours. Then from 8:05 to 9:15 is another hour and 10 minutes. So total 25 hours and 10 minutes. But let me check the exact times. The close time is 2024-03-02 09:15. So yes, 24 hours plus 1 hour 10 minutes. So 25h10m. Case 103: Received at 08:10, closed at 09:30 same day. So 1 hour 20 minutes. Case 104: Received at 08:20, closed at 08:30 on March 2nd. So from March 1 8:20 to March 2 8:30. That's 24 hours and 10 minutes. Wait, 8:20 to next day 8:20 is 24 hours, then +10 minutes. So 24h10m. Case 105: Received at 08:25, closed at 09:30 on March 3rd. Let's see. From March 1 8:25 to March 2 8:25 is 24h. March 2 8:25 to March 3 8:25 another 24h. Then from March 3 8:25 to 9:30 is 1h5m. So total 48h + 1h5m = 49h5m. Wait, but wait. Let's check the exact timeline. March 1 8:25 to March 3 9:30. So two full days (March 1 to March 3 is two days later?), but actually, from March 1 8:25 to March 2 8:25 is 24h. March 2 8:25 to March 3 8:25 another 24h. Then from March 3 8:25 to 9:30 is 1h5m. So total 49h5m. That's way longer. So total times: Case 101: 2h15m Case 102: 25h10m Case 103: 1h20m Case 104: 24h10m Case 105: 49h5m"

But maybe first check which ones are significantly longer. 101, 103 are under 2.5 hours. 102 is ~25h, 104 ~24h, 105 ~49h. So 105 is way longer, then 104 and 102 are also much longer than 101 and 103. So the cases with significantly longer resolution times are 102, 104, 105. Especially 105."

    "Text": "Now, looking for potential root causes. Let's check each of these longer cases. Starting with Case 102: Timeline: - Receive: 08:05 - Triage: 08:30 (25 min wait) - Assign to L1: 09:00 (30 min after triage) - Escalate to L2: 11:30 (2h30m after assignment) - Then Investigate Issue (L2) at 14:00 (2h30m after escalation) - Resolve at 09:00 next day (19h later) - Close at 09:15. Wait, after escalating to L2 at 11:30, the next activity is Investigate Issue at 14:00 same day. So 2h30m wait between escalation and investigation. Then after that, from 14:00 to next day 09:00 is 19 hours. So that's a long wait. Then resolve and close quickly. But why did it take so long after investigation? Maybe the investigation took time, but the timestamp for Investigate Issue is at 14:00, then Resolve at next day 09:00. So from 14:00 to 09:00 next day is about 19 hours. So maybe the agent was busy, or needed to wait for something else. But let's check Case 104: Case 104: Receive 08:20 Triage 09:00 (40 min wait) Assign to L1 09:30 (30 min after triage) Investigate Issue 13:00 (3h30m after assignment) Then Resolve at next day 08:00 (so from 13:00 same day to next day 08:00 is 19 hours) Close at 08:30. So again, after Investigate Issue, there's a long wait until resolve. Wait, but in this case, the Investigate Issue is at 13:00 on March 1, then Resolve at 08:00 March 2. So 19 hours. So same as Case 102. Case 105: Receive 08:25 Triage 08:35 (10 min) Assign L1 09:00 (25 min) Investigate Issue 09:10 (10 min after assignment) Then Escalate to L2 at 10:00 (so after investigating for 50 min? Wait, Investigate Issue at 09:10, then escalate at 10:00. So maybe they tried to resolve but couldn't and escalated. Then after escalation, next activity is Investigate Issue again at 2024-03-02 14:00. So from 10:00 on March 1 to March 2 14:00 is about 28 hours. Then after that, resolve at March 3 09:00, which is 19 hours later. So the escalation step here seems to have a long wait before the L2 team starts investigating. So for Case 105, after escalating at 10:00 on March 1, the next activity is Investigate Issue by L2 at 14:00 next day. So 28 hours wait. Then from Investigate Issue (L2) to Resolve is 19 hours. Then close. So the main delays here are the time between escalation and L2's investigation, and then the time after L2's investigation until resolution."

Then Resolve at March 3 09:00, which is 19 hours later. So all three have 19h between investigation start and resolution. Wait, that's interesting. 19 hours. So maybe after starting the investigation, there's a standard wait time of 19 hours? But why? Maybe the agents work during business hours, and the investigation starts late in the day, so they work on it the next business day. Let's check. For example, Case 102: Investigate starts at 14:00 (2pm) on March 1. Then resolve at 09:00 next day. So if they work 9-5, then from 2pm to 5pm is 3h, then next day 9am to 9am is 24h. But 19h total? Wait, from 14:00 to next day 09:00 is 19 hours. So if the agent worked until 5pm, then next day starts at 9am. So from 2pm to 5pm is 3h, then from 17:00 to next day 9:00 is 16h. So total 19h. So maybe the investigation started in the afternoon, then they worked on it until end of day, then next day started work at 9am and resolved at 9am. So 19h total. But why does it take 19 hours to resolve after starting investigation? Maybe the issue is complex and requires multiple steps, but the time seems too long. But in Case 101, after Investigate starts at 09:00, resolve at 10:00 (1h). So much quicker. So why the difference?"

    "Text": "Let me tabulate the time between each activity for each case. For each case, calculate the duration between consecutive activities. Case 101: Receive to Triage: 10 min Triage to Assign: 10 min Assign to Investigate: 40 min Investigate to Resolve: 1h Resolve to Close: 15 min Total: 2h15m Case 102: Receive to Triage: 25 min (08:05 to 08:30) Triage to Assign: 30 min (08:30 to 09:00) Assign to Escalate: 2h30m (09:00 to 11:30) Escalate to Investigate (L2): 2h30m (11:30 to 14:00) Investigate to Resolve: 19h (14:00 to next day 09:00) Resolve to Close: 15 min Case 103: Receive to Triage: 5 min Triage to Assign: 15 min Assign to Investigate: 15 min Investigate to Resolve: 30 min Resolve to Close: 15 min Total: 1h20m Case 104: Receive to Triage: 40 min (08:20 to 09:00) Triage to Assign: 30 min (09:00 to 09:30) Assign to Investigate: 3h30m (09:30 to 13:00) Investigate to Resolve: 19h (13:00 to next day 08:00) Resolve to Close: 30 min Case 105: Receive to Triage: 10 min Triage to Assign: 25 min Assign to Investigate: 10 min Investigate to Escalate: 50 min (09:10 to 10:00) Escalate to Investigate (L2): 28h (10:00 March 1 to 14:00 March 2) Investigate (L2) to Resolve: 19h (14:00 March 2 to 09:00 March 3) Resolve to Close: 30 min So looking at these intervals: For the longer cases: Case 102: The big delays are between Escalate and Investigate (L2) (2h30m), and then Investigate to Resolve (19h). But wait, the Escalate to Investigate is 2h30m, which is not too bad. But then Investigate to Resolve is 19h. Similarly, in Case 104, Assign to Investigate is 3h30m, then Investigate to Resolve 19h. Case 105: Escalate to Investigate (L2) is 28h, which is very long. Then Investigate to Resolve is 19h. So the main delays seem to be: - The time between escalation and L2 starting investigation (especially in 105: 28h) - The time between investigation (whether L1 or L2) and resolution. In all three cases, after starting investigation, there's a long wait until resolution."

    "Text": "So the main issue is the time between escalation and L2 starting to investigate. For example, Case 105's escalation to L2 investigation took 28h, which is way longer than Case 102's 2.5h. Why the difference? Maybe the L2 team has a backlog, or certain escalations are prioritized differently. Another thing to check: when escalations happen. For example, in Case 102, they escalated at 11:30 on March 1. In Case 105, escalated at 10:00 March 1. Both on the same day. But why does 105 take 28h before L2 starts investigating, while 102 takes only 2.5h? Possible reasons: maybe the L2 team has a backlog, and tickets are processed in order. If Case 105 was escalated when the L2 team was already busy, it had to wait. Alternatively, maybe the escalation process itself is not properly prioritized. For example, some escalations are high priority and handled quickly, others are low priority and wait longer. Another angle: looking at the time between Assign to L1 and Escalation. In Case 102: Assign at 09:00, escalate at 11:30 (2.5h). In Case 105: Assign at 09:00, escalate at 10:00 (1h). So Case 105 escalated faster. But then the L2 team took longer to start. So maybe the issue is not the time to escalate, but the L2 team's response time. Now, for the cases without escalation, like 104. Assign to L1 at 09:30, then Investigate Issue starts at 13:00 (3.5h). Then Resolve next day. So the L1 team is taking time to start investigating after assignment. Maybe they have a backlog, so tickets wait in queue before L1 starts working on them. For example, in Case 101, Assign to L1 at 08:20, Investigate starts at 09:00 (40 min). Case 103: Assign at 08:30, Investigate at 08:45 (15 min). But Case 104: 3.5h. So maybe the L1 team is overloaded on certain days, leading to longer wait times before starting investigation. But in Case 104, the Triage to Assign took 30 min (same as others), but Assign to Investigate took longer. So the problem is after assignment to L1, the agent doesn't start working on it right away. Maybe the L1 agents are busy with other tickets, so new assignments wait in a queue. So possible root causes: 1. Escalation delays: When tickets are escalated to L2, there's a significant wait time before L2 starts working. Especially for Case 105, which took 28h. This could be due to L2 team backlog or insufficient staffing. 2. L1 team delays: For tickets that don't escalate, like Case 104, there's a long wait between assignment to L1 and starting investigation. Maybe L1 agents are overwhelmed, leading to slow start on tickets. 3. Long resolution times after investigation starts: In all long cases, after investigation starts, it takes ~19h to resolve. Which might indicate that once the investigation starts, the resolution process is taking longer than usual. But why? Maybe the issues are more complex, but perhaps there's a bottleneck in the resolution phase. However, in cases like 101 and 103, resolution happens quickly after investigation. So maybe the complexity varies, but perhaps some tickets require external dependencies (like waiting for information from another team, or waiting for a fix to be deployed)."

    "Text": "Wait, but for Case 105, after L2 starts investigating at 14:00 March 2, they resolve at 09:00 March 3. So that's 19h. Similarly for others. So maybe the L2 team has a standard process that takes ~19h, but that seems odd. Unless the resolution is done the next business day. But if they start investigating at 2pm, they might not resolve until next day morning. So maybe the issue is that the resolution step is happening the next day, which is normal, but why does it take 19h? Because from 2pm to next day 9am is 19h. So maybe that's the typical time. But in the case of Case 101, they start investigating at 9am, resolve at 10am (1h), which is quick. So maybe the time between investigation and resolution depends on when the investigation starts. If it starts late in the day, then resolution happens next day. But why would that be considered a delay? Because if the process expects resolution within a certain time, but the start time of investigation affects it. But maybe the main issue is not the time between investigation and resolution, but the time before starting investigation. For example, in Case 105, the escalation to L2 investigation took 28h, which is way longer than others. That's a big problem. Whereas in Case 102, escalation to L2 start is 2.5h. So why such a difference? Possible reasons: maybe the L2 team has a backlog, and tickets are processed in order. If Case 105 was escalated when the L2 team was already busy, it had to wait.

Case 102 escalated once, Case 105 escalated once. But maybe the L2 team is understaffed, leading to longer wait times for escalations. Also, looking at Case 105: after escalation, there's a 28h wait before L2 starts investigating. Then after that, 19h until resolution. So total time after escalation is 47h. But maybe the main issue is the 28h wait before L2 starts. That's a huge delay. Similarly, in Case 102, the escalation to L2 start is 2.5h, which is okay. So why is 105's wait so long? Possible root causes: - L2 team has a high volume of escalations, leading to a backlog. - The escalation process isn't properly prioritized; perhaps some tickets are deprioritized. - Communication breakdown between L1 and L2 teams, leading to delays in handing off. Another thing: maybe the time when escalations happen affects the response time. For example, if escalations happen on Friday afternoon, they might not get handled until Monday. But in this log, all events are within March 1-3. Let's check the dates. Case 105 escalated on March 1 at 10:00. L2 starts investigating on March 2 at 14:00. So next day. So if the L2 team works Monday-Friday, but this is a Monday escalation, they start next day. Wait, March 1, 2024. Let me check. 2024-03-01 is a Friday. March 2 is Saturday. March 3 is Sunday. Wait, but the event log shows Case 105's Resolve at March 3 09:00. So maybe the team works weekends? Or maybe not. If the company doesn't work weekends, then escalations on Friday would be handled Monday. But in this case, Case 105 escalated on March 1 (Friday) at 10:00. If the L2 team doesn't work weekends, then the next business day is Monday, March 4. But in the log, L2 Investigate is on March 2 (Saturday) at 14:00. So maybe they do work weekends. But then why wait until March 2 14:00? If they work weekends, then it should be handled same day or next day. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the issue is that L2 team has a backlog and only works during certain hours. But regardless, the 28h delay for Case 105's escalation to L2 start is a problem. Now, for Case 104: no escalation. Assign to L1 at 09:30, then Investigate starts at 13:00 (3.5h later). Then Resolve next day. So the L1 team might be busy. Let's see how many tickets are assigned to L1 around that time. For example, on March 1: Case 101: assigned at 08:20 Case 102: assigned at 09:00 Case 103: assigned at 08:30 Case 104: assigned at 09:30 Case 105: assigned at 09:00 So L1 agents are handling multiple tickets. If the L1 team has limited agents, maybe there's a queue. For example, if there's only one L1 agent, then each ticket has to wait for the previous one to be handled. But in Case 101: assigned at 08:20, then Investigate starts at 09:00 (40 min). Case 103 assigned at 08:30, Investigate starts at 08:45 (15 min). Hmm, maybe multiple agents. But Case 104 assigned at 09:30, then starts investigating at 13:00. So if the L1 team has multiple agents, but they're busy with other tasks. Alternatively, maybe the L1 team has a policy to prioritize certain tickets. But without more data, hard to say. Another observation: the time between Triage and Assign. For all cases, this seems relatively short. Case 101: 10 min, 102: 30 min, 103:15, 104:30, 105:25. So maybe triage is done quickly. The main delays seem to be: - For escalated tickets: time between escalation and L2 starting investigation (especially Case 105) - For non-escalated tickets: time between assignment and starting investigation (Case 104) - Time between starting investigation and resolving (all long cases have ~19h) But why is the investigation to resolve time so long? In Case 101, it's 1h. So maybe the issues that require escalation or take longer to resolve are more complex, but perhaps there's a bottleneck in the resolution phase. But the key here is that the long resolution times are due to delays in starting the investigation phase (either L1 or L2), and then the resolution phase itself taking longer. However, the main bottleneck seems to be the time between assignment/escalation and starting the investigation. For example, in Case 105, the escalation to L2 investigation took 28h, which is way longer than others. That's a major delay. Similarly, Case 104's assign to investigate took 3.5h, which is longer than others (which were 15-40 min). So maybe the L1 team has a backlog when there are more tickets, leading to longer wait times before starting investigation. Another angle: looking at the time between Receive and Triage. All cases seem to have short times here. So that's not a bottleneck. So possible root causes: 1. L2 team has a backlog, causing long delays in handling escalated tickets (as seen in Case 105's 28h wait). 2. L1 team has a backlog, causing delays in starting investigation for non-escalated tickets (Case 104). 3. The resolution step itself is taking longer for complex issues, but perhaps the process doesn't have enough resources to handle complex issues quickly. But why do some escalated tickets get handled quickly (Case 102) and others slowly (Case 105)? Maybe Case 105 was escalated during a high workload period, or it was a lower priority ticket. Another possibility: the escalation process itself might not be properly tracked. For example, maybe when a ticket is escalated, it's not immediately assigned to L2, but sits in a queue. If the L2 team doesn't have a clear process for handling escalations, they might not prioritize them. But in Case 102, escalation to L2 Investigate took 2.5h. In 105, 28h. So maybe some tickets are stuck in L2's queue. Another possible factor: the time between escalations and L2's start. Let's see how many escalations there are. In the log, only two escalations: Case 102 and 105. Case 102 escalated once, Case 105 escalated once. But maybe the L2 team is understaffed, leading to longer wait times for escalations. Also, looking at Case 105: after escalation, there's a 28h wait before L2 starts investigating. Then after that, 19h until resolution. So total time after escalation is 47h. But maybe the main issue is the 28h wait before L2 starts. That's a huge delay. Similarly, in Case 102, the escalation to L2 start is 2.5h, which is okay. So why is 105's wait so long? Possible root causes: - L2 team has a high volume of escalations, leading to a backlog. - The escalation process isn't properly prioritized; perhaps some tickets are deprioritized. - Communication breakdown between L1 and L2 teams, leading to delays in handing off. Another thing: maybe the time when escalations happen affects the response time. For example, if escalations happen on Friday afternoon, they might not get handled until Monday. But in this log, all events are within March 1-3. Let's check the dates. Case 105 escalated on March 1 at 10:00. L2 starts investigating on March 2 at 14:00. So next day. So if the L2 team works Monday-Friday, but this is a Monday escalation, they start next day. Wait, March 1, 2024. Let me check. 2024-03-01 is a Friday. March 2 is Saturday. March 3 is Sunday. Wait, but the event log shows Case 105's Resolve at March 3 09:00. So maybe the team works weekends? Or maybe not. If the company doesn't work weekends, then escalations on Friday would be handled Monday. But in this case, Case 105 escalated on March 1 (Friday) at 10:00. If the L2 team doesn't work weekends, then the next business day is Monday, March 4. But in the log, L2 Investigate is on March 2 (Saturday) at 14:00. So maybe they do work weekends. But then why wait until March 2 14:00? If they work weekends, then it should be handled same day or next day. Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the issue is that L2 team has a backlog and only works during certain hours. But regardless, the 28h delay for Case 105's escalation to L2 start is a problem."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Recommendations: - Analyze the L2 team's workload and response times. If some escalations take much longer than others, perhaps there's a need to prioritize high-impact tickets or increase L2 staffing. - Implement a SLA (Service Level Agreement) for escalation response times. For example, escalations should be handled within 4 hours. If not, alert managers. - For L1 team, check why some tickets take longer to start investigation. Maybe there's a queue management system to ensure tickets are handled in order, or additional resources during peak times. - Also, the time between investigation start and resolution seems consistently long for some cases. Maybe the resolution phase could be streamlined. For example, if the investigation reveals a known issue, the resolution could be faster. But if it's a new issue, it might take longer. However, if many tickets take 19h to resolve after investigation starts, perhaps the process for resolution is inefficient. Wait, but in Case 101, the investigation starts at 09:00 and resolves at 10:00. So 1h. So maybe the resolution time varies based on issue complexity. But if the same issue type takes longer, perhaps there's a need to improve processes for complex issues. But looking at the data, the main issue seems to be the long wait times before starting investigation (for both L1 and L2), and especially the L2 escalation delays. Another thing to check: the number of escalations. In the log, only two cases escalated. But maybe in reality, more escalations would show a pattern. But based on this data, the two escalated cases have different delays. Case 102 escalated to L2, and L2 started investigating quickly (2.5h), but then took 19h to resolve. Case 105 escalated, L2 took 28h to start, then 19h to resolve. So the main difference is the time before L2 starts working. So the biggest problem is the delay in L2 starting to work on escalated tickets. For Case 105, the 28h wait is a major issue. Possible reasons: - L2 team has too many tickets and is understaffed. - Escalations are not properly prioritized (e.g., all escalations are treated equally, even if some are urgent). - Manual handoff between teams causing delays. Recommendations: - Implement a dedicated escalation queue with SLAs. For example, escalations should be assigned to L2 within 2 hours. - Monitor L2 team workload and adjust staffing levels accordingly. - Automate the escalation process so that once L1 escalates, it's automatically assigned to L2 without manual intervention. - For the L1 team, analyze workload and ensure proper queue management to reduce time between assignment and investigation start. Another observation: Case 104 didn't escalate, but took a long time. Assign to L1 at 09:30, then Investigate starts at 13:00. So 3.5h. Whereas other L1 tickets started investigating within 40 min. So maybe the L1 team has a backlog. If multiple tickets are assigned to L1 around the same time, they might be queued. For example, on March 1: Case 101 assigned at 08:20 Case 103 assigned at 08:30 Case 102 assigned at 09:00 Case 105 assigned at 09:00 Case 104 assigned at 09:30 If there are only two L1 agents, they might be handling these sequentially. For example: Agent 1: 101 starts at 08:20, works until 09:00 (40 min), then next ticket. Agent 2: 103 assigned at 08:30, starts at 08:45 (15 min wait), etc. But then Case 104 assigned at 09:30 might have to wait longer if agents are busy. But without knowing the number of agents, it's hard to say. But the key is that the time between assignment and starting investigation varies widely, which suggests inconsistent handling. So possible recommendations: - Implement a queue system where tickets are assigned to agents based on availability, reducing wait times. - Monitor average wait time between assignment and investigation start, and set targets. - For escalated tickets, ensure that L2 team has a clear process for handling them promptly. Another thing: in Case 105, after escalating to L2, there's a long wait. Then when L2 starts investigating, it takes another 19h to resolve. So total time after escalation is 47h. But maybe the resolution step could be faster. But why does it take 19h? If the L2 team starts at 14:00, and resolves next day at 09:00, that's a normal business day. But if the resolution should happen within a few hours, then it's a problem. However, if the issue is complex, maybe 19h is acceptable. But compared to Case 102, which escalated and resolved in 19h after investigation start, but the escalation wait was only 2.5h. So the main issue is the escalation wait time for Case 105. So the main bottleneck is the time between escalation and L2 starting work. That's where the biggest delay occurs. In summary: - Cases 102, 104, 105 have significantly longer resolution times. - Case 105 has the longest due to a 28-hour delay between escalation and L2 starting investigation. - Case 104 has a long delay between L1 assignment and starting investigation. - All long cases have a ~19-hour delay between investigation start and resolution, which might be due to business hours (e.g., starting investigation late in the day), but could also indicate inefficiencies in resolution process. Root causes: 1. Inefficient escalation handling: L2 team has high backlog or slow response time to escalations. 2. L1 team workload issues causing delays in starting investigations for non-escalated tickets. 3. Possible lack of prioritization for urgent tickets. Recommendations: - Establish SLAs for escalation response times (e.g., escalate within 2 hours) and monitor compliance. - Increase L2 staffing during peak times or implement a more efficient ticket routing system. - For L1 team, analyze workload and ensure proper queue management to reduce time between assignment and investigation start. - Review the resolution process for complex issues to identify bottlenecks; perhaps provide more training or resources for L2 agents. - Consider implementing a priority system where high-impact tickets are escalated and handled more quickly. Another thought: maybe some tickets are being escalated unnecessarily. For example, in Case 105, the L1 agent escalated after only 50 minutes of investigation. Maybe they could have resolved it themselves, but instead escalated, causing longer delays. So checking if escalations are justified could help. If L1 agents are escalating too quickly without trying to resolve first, that could add unnecessary steps. But in the data, for Case 105: Assign to L1 at 09:00, Investigate Issue starts at 09:10, then Escalate at 10:00. So only 50 minutes of investigation before escalating. That's quite quick. Maybe they didn't have enough time to resolve it themselves. But if the issue is complex, maybe it's okay. But if the L1 agent could have resolved it with more time, but they escalated too soon, then that's a problem. Alternatively, if the escalation process is too slow, then even if escalated, the L2 team takes too long. So perhaps the root cause is a combination of unnecessary escalations (if L1 could handle it) and slow L2 response. But without knowing the ticket types, it's hard to say. But based on the data, the main issue seems to be the delays after escalation to L2. So to answer the task: 1. Which cases have longer times: 102, 104, 105. 105 is the longest. 2. Root causes: delays in L2 handling escalated tickets (especially Case 105's 28h wait), L1 team delays in starting investigation for non-escalated tickets (Case 104), and possibly unnecessary escalations leading to longer paths. 3. Recommendations: improve escalation process SLAs, monitor L2 workload, ensure proper prioritization, and review L1 escalation practices to ensure only necessary escalations."
