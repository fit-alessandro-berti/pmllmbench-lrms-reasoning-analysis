Alright, first step is probably to calculate the total resolution time for each case. The resolution time would be from when the ticket was received to when it was closed.

Yes, 8:00 to 10:15 is 2h15m. Case 102: Received at 08:05, closed at 09:15 on March 2nd. Wait, the close is on March 2nd at 9:15. So from March 1 8:05 to March 2 9:15. Let's calculate that. From 8:05 March 1 to 8:05 March 2 is 24 hours, then plus 1 hour 10 minutes more? Wait, no. Wait, from March 1 8:05 to March 2 8:05 is exactly 24 hours. Then from 8:05 to 9:15 is another hour and 10 minutes. So total 25 hours and 10 minutes. But let me check the exact times. The close time is 2024-03-02 09:15. So yes, 24 hours plus 1 hour 10 minutes. So 25h10m. Case 103: Received at 08:10, closed at 09:30 same day. So 1 hour 20 minutes. Case 104: Received at 08:20, closed at 08:30 on March 2nd. So from March 1 8:20 to March 2 8:30. That's 24 hours and 10 minutes. Wait, 8:20 to next day 8:20 is 24 hours, then +10 minutes. So 24h10m. Case 105: Received at 08:25, closed at 09:30 on March 3rd. Let's see. From March 1 8:25 to March 2 8:25 is 24h. March 2 8:25 to March 3 8:25 another 24h. Then from March 3 8:25 to 9:30 is 1h5m. So total 48h + 1h5m = 49h5m. Wait, but wait. Let's check the exact timeline. March 1 8:25 to March 3 9:30. So two full days (March 1 to March 3 is two days later?), but actually, from March 1 8:25 to March 2 8:25 is 24h. March 2 8:25 to March 3 8:25 another 24h. Then from March 3 8:25 to 9:30 is 1h5m. So total 49h5m. That's way longer."

But maybe first check which ones are significantly longer. 101, 103 are under 2.5 hours. 102 is ~25h, 104 ~24h, 105 ~49h. So 105 is way longer, then 104 and 102 are also much longer than 101 and 103.

Maybe the agents work during business hours, and the investigation starts late in the day, so they work on it the next business day. Let's check. For example, Case 102: Investigate starts at 14:00 (2pm) on March 1. Then resolve at 09:00 next day. So if they work 9-5, then from 2pm to 5pm is 3h, then from 17:00 to next day 9:00 is 16h. So total 19h. So maybe the investigation started in the afternoon, then they worked on it until end of day, then next day started work at 9am and resolved at 9am."

    "Text": "But looking at Case 105: Escalate at 10:00 March 1, then L2 Investigate starts at 14:00 March 2. So 28 hours. That's a big wait. So maybe the L2 team is not handling escalations promptly. If the escalation process has a long wait time before L2 starts working on it, that's a bottleneck. Similarly, in Case 102: Escalate at 11:30, then L2 Investigate starts at 14:00 same day (2.5h). That's not too bad, but then the resolution takes 19h. But in Case 105, the wait for L2 to start investigating is 28h. That's way longer. So maybe the main issue is the time between escalation and L2 starting to investigate."

    "Text": "Recommendations: - Analyze the L2 team's workload and response times. If some escalations take much longer than others, perhaps there's a need to prioritize high-impact tickets or increase L2 staffing. - Implement a SLA (Service Level Agreement) for escalation response times. For example, escalations should be handled within 4 hours. If not, alert managers. - For L1 team, check why some tickets take longer to start investigation. Maybe there's a queue management system to ensure tickets are handled in order, or additional resources during peak times."
