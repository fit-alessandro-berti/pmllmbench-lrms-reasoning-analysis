    "Text": "In process mining, a case is usually a single instance of a process. For example, if the process is creating a quarterly report, then all activities related to that report would be in one case. Alternatively, if the user is working on multiple things, each could be a separate case. But looking at the log: The user is working on two different Word documents: Quarterly_Report.docx and Document1.docx. But Document1 seems to be a draft thats being worked on, then later referenced in Quarterly_Report."

But in Chrome, the window title might not change much. Hmm.) Case 4: Report_Draft.pdf Case 5: Budget_2024.xlsx"

    "Text": "The case ID is determined by the document being worked on. So for each document (window title), all events related to that window would be part of the same case. For Document1.docx: FOCUS at 09:00:00 TYPING at 09:00:30, 09:01:00 SAVE at 09:01:15 Then later, SWITCH from Excel to Document1 at 09:06:00. So when switching back to Document1, thats another FOCUS event for Document1. Then TYPING at 09:06:15, SAVE at 09:06:30, then CLOSE at 09:07:00. So yes, all these events belong to Document1 case."

    "Text": "For the SWITCH event: The From windows case is where the event belongs. So if you switch from App A to App B, the SWITCH event is part of App As case. Yes, that makes sense. Because the action of switching away from App A is part of App As process. Then the next events in App B are part of App Bs case. So for the SWITCH event at 09:01:45: FromApp=Word, FromWindow=Document1.docx, ToApp=Chrome, ToWindow=Email - Inbox. So the SWITCH event itself would be part of the Document1 case. Then the next events in Chrome would be part of the email case. Similarly, switching from Chrome to Acrobat: SWITCH event is part of email case. Then Acrobat events are part of Report_Draft case. Switching from Excel to Document1: SWITCH event is part of Excel case (Budget_2024), then Document1 events are part of Document1 case."

    "Text": "Now, for the event log table. The required attributes are: Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Additional attributes can be included, like App, Window, Keys, etc., but the main ones are Case ID, Activity, Timestamp. But for process mining tools, sometimes additional attributes are useful. So perhaps include App, Window, and any other relevant attributes. This creates a coherent event log where each case represents a distinct process instance (e.g., working on a specific document or email), and activities are standardized for analysis."
