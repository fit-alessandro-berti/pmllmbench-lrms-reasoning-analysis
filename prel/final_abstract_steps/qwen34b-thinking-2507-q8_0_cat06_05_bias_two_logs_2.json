It could lead to underrepresentation of non-club members (like U002) 3. The adjustment is applied only to those who are already in the club, which might not be representative of the broader workforce 4. Since Group B candidates are all marked as LocalResident (TRUE), this might be targeting local business owners who have different opportunities"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also important: The LocalResident being TRUE for Group B might indicate they're local to the area, but the bias is specifically tied to the club affiliation, not just being local. That's crucial - the bias is about professional association, not geographic location."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Final conclusion: Group B exhibits bias through the +5 CulturalFit adjustment for LocalBusinessLeadersClub members. This is unfair because it gives an artificial advantage to candidates with specific professional affiliations while systematically disadvantaging others."
