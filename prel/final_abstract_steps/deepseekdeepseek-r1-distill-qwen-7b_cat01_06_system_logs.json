My goal is to convert these into events suitable for process mining tools. That means I need to group related events into cases and come up with meaningful activity names."

For example, the user starts by FOCUSing on Microsoft Word, then TYPING to edit a document, saving it, then switching to Google Chrome to send an email, and so on. Each of these could be a separate case because they involve different applications and windows."

Or is the entire process of editing and sending an email considered one case? I think the latter makes more sense because the user is handling a task that involves multiple applications."
