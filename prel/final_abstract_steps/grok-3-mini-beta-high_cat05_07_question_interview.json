    "Text": "1. Initial Contact and Documentation Review: Landlord contacts regional office. Property coordinator reviews documents (deeds, certificates, inspection reports). If missing or outdated, requests updates. 2. Recording Property Details: Coordinator records details into central database (square footage, units, location, amenities, expected rental price). 3. Assigning Property Manager: Based on workload, geographic specialization, experience, track record. Introductory call/meeting to align expectations and discuss special conditions. 4. Property Inspection and Marketing: Schedule photographer and inspector. Address any issues found by inspector. Digital marketing team creates listings and updates pricing. 5. Activating Property and Tenant Screening: Activate in rental portal. Handle tenant applications, screening (credit checks, references). Negotiate terms if multiple applicants. 6. Finalizing Lease and Quality Checks: Finalize lease, collect deposit, schedule move-in. Compliance checks, financial verification, IT integration. 7. Overall Process: Multiple decision points, stakeholders, exceptions, communication flows."

How is the central database structured conceptually? Category 2: Understanding Decision Criteria - For assigning property managers: what factors are weighted more heavily? How is workload measured? For tenant screening: what criteria are used to select tenants? For pricing: how are market trends analyzed? Category 3: Clarifying Roles and Responsibilities - Who does what? E.g., what is the property coordinator's exact role vs. property manager? What about the digital marketing team? How do responsibilities overlap or hand off between teams? Category 4: Verifying Timing and Sequencing - What is the typical timeline for each step? Are there dependencies between steps? How long does the entire process usually take? What can cause delays? Category 5: Learning about Exception Handling - How are exceptions like missing documents or inspection failures handled? What about special cases like properties needing special insurance or custom lease clauses?"

How do you decide which property manager to assign to a new property? What criteria do you use, and how are they prioritized? 4. Could you walk me through a typical introductory meeting between the property manager and the landlord? What key topics are covered? 5. What is the process for scheduling and conducting the property inspection and photography? How do you select the photographers and inspectors? 6. If issues are found during inspection, how do you collaborate with the landlord to resolve them? Are there standard procedures or timelines? 7. How does the digital marketing team determine the pricing for a new listing? What data sources or models do they use? 8. What steps are involved in activating the property in your rental portal, and who is responsible for that? 9. In tenant screening, what factors influence the decision to approve or reject an applicant? How do you handle competitive situations with multiple applicants? 10. Can you explain the quality check process after a tenant is selected? Who performs these checks and what do they entail? 11. How are exceptions, such as properties requiring special insurance, managed within the onboarding process? 12. What tools or methods do you use to track communication and progress throughout the onboarding process? 13. Typically, how long does the entire property onboarding process take from initial contact to the tenant moving in? What factors can affect this timeline? 14. Are there any regional differences in how this process is handled across different cities or offices?"
