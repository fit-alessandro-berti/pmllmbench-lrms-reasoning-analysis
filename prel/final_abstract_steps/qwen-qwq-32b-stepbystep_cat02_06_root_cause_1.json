    "Text": "So the root causes could be 1 Delay in the Level2 team responding to escalated tickets In case 105 it took 28 hours between escalation and the Level2 starting work on it Thats a big issue 2 The time between investigation and resolution is overnight which might be due to the team not working outside business hours However if the investigation to resolve takes 19 hours thats a day so maybe the Level2 team is only working during the day so the ticket is left overnight leading to that delay But thats a structural issue if they cant work outside hours Alternatively maybe after investigation they need to wait for more information from the customer or something but not indicated in the log Looking for other possible factors Looking at the steps between activities For example in Case 102 between Assign 900 and escalate 1130 is 25 hours Maybe the Level1 agent spent that time trying to handle it before escalating That might be acceptable or not but the main delays are postescalation Similarly in case 104 after assign the investigation starts at 1300 4 hours after assign But then from investigate to resolve is overnight Another point the escalation itself might be a step that requires time But the main issue is the time between escalate and the next step investigation by Level2 In case 102 thats 25 hours but in 105 its 28 hours So thats a big difference So maybe some escalations are handled quickly others not Another possible factor the time between investigation and resolve Let me check each case Case 101 investigate 900 to resolve 1000 is 1 hour So quick Case 102 investigate 1400 to resolve 900 next day 19 hours So overnight but if the team only works 85 then maybe its just the overnight delay But thats part of the total time Similarly case 104 investigate at 1300 resolve next day 800 19 hours Same as 102 Case 105 investigate after escalate is on March 2nd 1400 then resolve at 3rd 900 which is 23 hours So the big delays are between escalate and next investigation especially in 105 and between investigation and resolve overnight However maybe the overnight times are unavoidable but if the team isnt working nights thats just part of the cycle time But the 28hour delay between escalate and investigation in case 105 is a problem Another possible issue is the time between Assign and investigation For example in case 104 after Assign at 930 investigation starts at 1300 thats 35 hours Maybe thats a delay before starting the investigation Not sure Wait in case 101 the Assign to investigation is 40 minutes assign at 820 investigate starts at 900 So 40 mins Case 102 Assign at 900 then escalate at 1130 So between assign and escalate the investigation started at 1130 escalate is the next step but the actual investigation after escalation is at 1400 Wait maybe the steps are Assign to Level1 then they start investigating but cant so escalate then the Level2 needs to take over So the time between escalate and the next investigate step by Level2 is the key In case 102 thats 25 hours but in 105 its 28 hours So thats a huge discrepancy So the root causes could be 1 Delay in the Level2 team responding to escalated tickets In case 105 it took 28 hours between escalation and the Level2 starting work on it Thats a big issue 2 The time between investigation and resolution is overnight which might be due to the team not working outside business hours However if the investigation to resolve takes 19 hours thats a day so maybe the Level2 team is only working during the day so the ticket is left overnight leading to that delay But thats a structural issue if they cant work outside hours"

    "Text": "So to sum up the factors causing delays are 1 Long delays between escalation and the Level2 team starting work eg case 105s 28h delay between escalate and Level2s investigation 2 Overnight delays between investigation and resolution when the team is not available leading to overnight delays like 19 hours between investigation and resolve in case 102 and 104 3 Possibly the time between investigation and resolve is too long even during active hours Additionally in case 105 after escalate to Level2 the next investigate is on the same day Wait no case 105s escalate is on 1st at 1000 then next activity is investigate on 2nd 1400 Thats a day and a half Thats a big delay in Level2s response So the root causes are likely Delays in the Level2 team addressing escalated tickets eg 28 hours in case 105 Overnight delays between investigation and resolution because the team isnt working during nights Maybe the Level2 team is overburdened or slow in starting their part Additionally in case 105 after escalate to Level2 the investigation by Level2 is delayed So the Level2 team isnt getting to the ticket quickly Another point the number of steps For example case 105 had an escalate then after escalate they have to investigate again adding more steps But the time is the key So the main factors are Escalation handling significant delays in when Level2 starts working on the ticket after escalation Overnight delays nonbusiness hours causing extended resolution times Additionally maybe the time between assign and escalate is too long but in case 105 the escalate was only 50 minutes after assigning assigned at 900 escalate at 1000 So thats okay Other possible factors Maybe some steps have long waiting times between activities For example in case 105 after escalate 1000 on 1st to the next step investigate on 2nd 1400 is 28 hours Thats the key issue So recommendations would be to ensure that escalated tickets are addressed quickly by Level2 maybe better escalation processes or more resources for Level2 Also maybe afterhours coverage to reduce overnight delays or better communication between teams to reduce the time between escalate and investigation Another possible cause is that after escalate the ticket sits until the next business day hence the delay For instance if the escalate happens at 1000 on the 1st and the next days investigate is at 1400 that would be 28 hours If the business hours are 85 then after escalate at 1000 maybe the Level2 team is busy and they dont pick it up until the next day So maybe the Level2 team is overworked leading to long queues So to summarize the root causes 1 Delayed response from the Level2 team after escalation eg 28 hours in case 105 2 Overnight delays between investigation and resolution if the process cant proceed outside business hours 3 Possibly after investigation theres a long wait for resolution which could be due to team availability or inefficiency So the recommendations would be to improve Level2s response time maybe by adding more staff better prioritization or better escalation management Also maybe allowing some coverage outside regular hours to reduce overnight delays Also ensuring that when the investigation is done the resolve step is done the same day if possible Also maybe the process could have a better way to track escalated tickets to ensure theyre picked up promptly Another idea Maybe the Level2 team isnt getting the tickets quickly enough after escalation So the key issue is the Level2s responsiveness Another thing In case 105 after the first investigation by Level1 9101000 then escalate then Level2 doesnt pick up for a day and a half Thats a big issue So summarizing Root causes 1 Delay in Level2 teams response to escalated tickets leading to long gaps between escalation and investigation Root cause 2 Overnight delays when the process halts during nonbusiness hours increasing total time Root cause 3 Prolonged delays between investigation and resolution possibly due to team availability or inefficiency Proposals Improve Level2 teams responsiveness by adding staff better prioritization or better communication Implement afterhours coverage or improve scheduling to reduce overnight delays Streamline the process between investigation and resolution to reduce that steps time Also maybe the escalation process itself is slow or theres a backlog in Level2 Another observation Case 105s total time is almost double that of 102 and 104 which also had escalations but 102 and 104 took about 2425 hours while 105 is 49 hours So the 28hour delay between escalate and investigation is the key differentiator So the main factors are the time between escalation and the Level2s action and the overnight delays Therefore the recommendations should address those points"
