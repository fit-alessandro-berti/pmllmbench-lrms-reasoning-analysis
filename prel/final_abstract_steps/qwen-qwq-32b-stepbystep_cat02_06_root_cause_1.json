Let me see the steps: Receive (8:05) -> Triage (8:30) – 25m. Then Assign (9:00) – 30m after triage. Then until escalate is 2.5 hours...Then escalate to investigate...Then investigation starts at 14:00, then the next step is resolve at 9:00 next day (March 2nd 9:00).

Wait, that's the next day. So from 10:00 to 14:00 next day is 28 hours? Wait, March 1st 10:00 to March 2nd 14:00 is 28 hours. That's a huge delay between escalate and the next investigate step...Then after that, the investigation on the 2nd at 14:00, then resolve on the 3rd 9:00. So between investigate and resolve is 23 hours. That's another big gap. So the big delays in 105 are between escalate and next investigate (28h), then investigate to resolve (23h)."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So perhaps when a ticket is escalated, there's a delay before the Level-2 team picks it up. Like, after escalate, the Level-2 might not start the investigation immediately. In case 102, the escalate to investigate is 2.5 hours. Maybe that's okay, but in case 105 it's 28 hours. That's a big issue...So the main issues seem to be: 1. Long delays after escalation, particularly in cases where the Level-2 team takes too long to start working on the ticket (like case 105's 28h delay between escalate and Level-2's investigation)."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Also, after investigation, the resolve step is taking too long. Like in case 102 and 104, the time between investigation and resolve is overnight. Maybe the agents are not working during off-hours, so the clock stops? Or maybe they need to work during the next day."

    "Text": "Looking for other possible factors: Looking at triage times...Assign is done quickly in all cases...The main problem seems to be after escalation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the root causes could be: 1. Delay in the Level-2 team responding to escalated tickets. In case 105, it took 28 hours between escalation and the Level-2 starting work on it. That's a big issue. 2. Also, after investigation, the resolve step is taking too long. Like in case 102 and 104, the time from investigation to resolve is overnight. Wait, so from 14:00 to 9:00 next day is 19 hours. That's a long time for investigation to resolution...So the root causes are likely: Delays in the Level-2 team addressing escalated tickets (e.g., 28 hours in case 105). Overnight delays between investigation and resolution because the team isn't working during nights. Maybe the Level-2 team is overburdened or slow in starting their part."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So recommendations would be to ensure that escalated tickets are addressed quickly by Level-2, maybe better escalation processes or more resources for Level-2. Also, maybe after-hours coverage to reduce overnight delays, or better communication between teams to reduce the time between escalate and investigation...Improve Level-2 team's responsiveness by adding staff, better prioritization, or better communication. Implement after-hours coverage or improve scheduling to reduce overnight delays. Streamline the process between investigation and resolution to reduce that step's time."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Another observation: Case 105's total time is almost double that of 102 and 104, which also had escalations, but 102 and 104 took about 24-25 hours, while 105 is 49 hours. So the 28-hour delay between escalate and investigation is the key differentiator. So the main factors are the time between escalation and the Level-2's action, and the overnight delays. Therefore, the recommendations should address those points."
