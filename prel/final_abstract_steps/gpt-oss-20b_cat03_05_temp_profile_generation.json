Wait: The instruction says Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times. But we are generating output; we can give numbers? The scenario says Your task: Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. For each pair of activities that appear ... assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. So we need to give numbers. The earlier instruction about Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt refers to earlier part of conversation? Actually it's part of instructions: Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times. That might mean that when writing prompts for LLM, don't give numeric times; but here we are generating answer with numeric estimates."

Actually storage maybe variable; let's set avg=604800 seconds (~7 days) std=432000? But maybe simpler: use realistic values but arbitrary.
