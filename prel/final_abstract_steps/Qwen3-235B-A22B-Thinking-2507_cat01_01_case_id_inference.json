Dr. Lee is working in both Surgery and ER? Possible if it's a small hospital or Dr. Lee is cross-departmental. But logically, for the 45M patient, it's an ER case, so Dr. Lee might be an ER physician here, while for the 28M, it's a surgical case. So same doctor name, but different contexts - doesn't contradict the grouping since patient attributes differ."
