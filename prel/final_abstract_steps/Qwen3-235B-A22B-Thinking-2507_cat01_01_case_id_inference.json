For example, Event 12 Doctor consultation for 45M at 8:23:10 timestamp right after event 11 8:22:54 for 62F, but since theyre different patients, its fine that consultations happen close together. Event 6 Doctor consultation for 28M at 8:13:00 in Surgery department before the ER patients activities, which makes sense because its a scheduled surgery, not an emergency."

Event 7 is X-ray for 45M in Radiology, but for 28M no imaging mentioned they went straight to surgery consultation. Thats fine, different treatment paths."

Dr. Lee is working in both Surgery and ER possible if its a small hospital or Dr. Lee is cross-departmental. But logically, for the 45M patient, its an ER case, so Dr. Lee might be an ER physician here, while for the 28M, its a surgical case. So same doctor name, but different contexts does not contradict the grouping since patient attributes differ."

All within 2 minutes, but different departments and patients, so plausible. Triage happens shortly after registration for ER patients: 45M reg 8:05 triage 8:10 5 min later, 62F reg 8:07 triage 8:12 5 min later. For surgery patient, registration at 8:07:15, then consultation at 8:13:00 5.75 min later, which might be quicker since its scheduled. All sequences look clean."
