Wait, but how to model that in the DECLARE terms? The problem states that for these four keys, each activity's value is 1.0 and confidence. So perhaps an 'existence' rule could be something like: If A exists (supports), then B must exist with certain conditions. But how do you express that if IG exists then DD must exist? That's a conditional statement. But according to the problem's key structure, maybe it's not possible here because these keys don't handle pairs or multiple activities."

    "Text": "However, considering that all values are 1.0 and confidence for these keys, perhaps they can be treated as rules where those activities always happen when their conditions are met with full certainty.

Possible entries in existence: IG exists for every process instance.

But according to the problem statement's example for chain rules (like 'chainsuccession'), this would require that after A exists, B follows then C. In our scenario, if PC is created (A), then LT (B) followed by UT (C) occurs. So: chainresponse = { (\"PC\", \"LT\", \"UT\"): {\"support\": 1.0, \"confidence\": 1.0}, } ... Similarly, succession rules could track the order of activities: for example, AG must follow TFC/CE and tests (LT/UT) approval gate exists before proceeding to MP then FL... chainsuccession: { (\"AG\", \"MP\", \"FL\"): {\"support\": 1.0, \"confidence\": 1.0}, }"
