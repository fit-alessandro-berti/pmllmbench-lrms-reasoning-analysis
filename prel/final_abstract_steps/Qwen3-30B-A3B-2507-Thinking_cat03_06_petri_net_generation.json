The decision is after DV. How about: We model the DV activity as a transition. After DV, we have a place dv_done. Then we split from dv_done to two places: one for documents complete and one for documents incomplete. But note, we dont want to model the decision as a place? We can use a choice (a place that can be marked by either the complete or incomplete branch). Standard way: use a place that is the result of DV, and then two transitions from that place. So: Place: dv_after Transition: dv_complete (label=DV_complete) -> leads to fc_before Transition: dv_incomplete (label=DV_incomplete) -> leads to rds_before Then we have a transition for RDS (label=RDS) that goes from rds_before to dv_after."

    "Text": "However, note: the problem says Approval (AP) is the activity. So the transition for the approval activity is AP. But we have a condition (if threshold exceeded) that triggers the AP activity. So we have two transitions from ca_after: one for when approval is needed (and then we do AP) and one for when not. Well label: The transition that leads to AP: we can call it AP_needed (meaning the condition that approval is needed) and then the AP transition (activity) will be the next step. However, in the problem, the step is called Approval (AP), so the activity is the approval. We dont have an activity for the condition. So we can model the condition as a split without an activity. Therefore, we can have: ca_after -> (if needed) -> ap_before ca_after -> (if not) -> p_before And then the transition for the approval activity (AP) is from ap_before to ap_after. Similarly, for the other conditions. Now, note: the problem does not require modeling the condition as an activity, so we can use a split (without a transition) by having two arcs from ca_after to ap_before and to p_before. But in Petri nets, we can have multiple arcs from a place to two different places (without a transition). However, the standard way is to use a transition for the condition? Actually, we dont need an activity for the condition, so we model it by having two outgoing arcs from the place. So we can do: ca_after has two outgoing arcs: one to ap_before (labeled with the condition if threshold exceeded, but we dont have a transition for that condition) one to p_before (labeled if threshold not exceeded) But note: the problem says the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So the condition is inherent, and we dont have an activity for the condition. Therefore, we model the condition as two arcs without a transition. Similarly for the other conditions (DV and FC). So we remove the transitions DV_complete, DV_incomplete, FC_no_doubt, FC_doubt? Actually, no: the condition is modeled by the split (multiple arcs). The activities are the transitions. Therefore, we dont need the transitions for the conditions (like DV_complete). We just have: dv_after has two outgoing arcs: one to fc_before (for the complete case) -> well label the arc with complete but in the code we dont label arcs, we just have the arcs. one to rds_before (for the incomplete case) However, the problem says the transition for DV is the activity DV, so we have a transition for DV (which is the activity) that goes from cr_after to dv_after. Then, after DV (so at dv_after), we have two choices: complete or incomplete. We model that by having two arcs from dv_after to two different places. Similarly, for FC: we have a transition for FC (activity) from fc_before to fc_after. Then after FC (fc_after), we have two arcs: one to ca_before (for no doubt) and one to ii_before (for doubt). So we dont need the transitions DV_complete, DV_incomplete, FC_no_doubt, FC_doubt. Therefore, we adjust: Places: start cr_after dv_after rds_before fc_before fc_after ii_before ca_before ca_after ap_before ap_after p_before p_after n_after closed Transitions (with labels as the activity names): CR: start -> cr_after DV: cr_after -> dv_after RDS: rds_before -> dv_after [but note: RDS is a step that happens after DV fails, so its an activity that we have to model as a transition] FC: fc_before -> fc_after II: ii_before -> fc_before CA: ca_before -> ca_after AP: ap_before -> ap_after P: p_before -> p_after N: p_after -> n_after CL: n_after -> closed And the splits (without transitions) for the conditions: From dv_after: arc to fc_before (for complete) arc to rds_before (for incomplete) From fc_after: arc to ca_before (for no doubt) arc to ii_before (for doubt) From ca_after: arc to ap_before (for threshold exceeded) arc to p_before (for threshold not exceeded)"
