Actually, we don't need an activity for the condition, so we can have two arcs. Therefore, we don't need the transitions for the conditions (like DV_complete).

We are using the string names as the place names. But note: the Place objects have a name attribute. However, in the code above, we are using the string as the name when creating the Place. Then we assign the Place object to a variable (like start). When we add to the net, we use the Place object. This is correct. Let's write the code."
