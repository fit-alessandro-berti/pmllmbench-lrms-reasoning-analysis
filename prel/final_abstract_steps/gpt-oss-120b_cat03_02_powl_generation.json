Need to create nodes for each activity: SR, CS, DA, ACI, BNC, D&R, CD, MD, QA, SA, GLA. Use loops: loop between BNC and D&R (Operator.LOOP). Use XOR choice between CD and MD (Operator.XOR). Use partial orders: overall root StrictPartialOrder with nodes being the main components: SR, CS, parallel tasks (DA, ACI), loop node, xor node, final tasks (QA, SA), GLA. Need to add edges to enforce ordering constraints."
