Actually typical representation: * (A,B) means first execute A, then optionally repeat B followed by A? Wait description: * (A,B) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again. So first part is mandatory execution of A; after that you can exit or do B + repeat of A."
