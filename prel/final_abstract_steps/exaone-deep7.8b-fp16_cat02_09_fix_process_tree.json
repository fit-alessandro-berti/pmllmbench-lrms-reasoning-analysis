    "Text": "The pseudocode defines a sequence starting with creating and approving the requisition. Then there's a parallel block (AND operator) that includes creating the purchase order, receiving goods, receiving invoices, matching invoices, and paying. Finally, it closes the case. The problem is that this setup allows steps in the parallel block to occur out of order, which isn't correct for the Procure-to-Pay process."

    "Text": "The correct sequence should be: Create Purchase Requisition, Approve Purchase Requisition, Create Purchase Order, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice to PO, Pay Invoice, and Close Case. The issue is that the current model allows steps 3 through 7 to be in any order within the parallel block, which is incorrect."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "By replacing the parallel block with a sequence (Operator.SEQUENCE) that enforces the correct order of steps after approve_req, the model would ensure the domain logic is strictly followed, preventing out-of-order execution."

    "Text": "The corrected model enforces strict ordering by making each step explicitly follow the previous one: First, create and approve the requisition, then create the purchase order, then receive goods, and so on, until close case. This adjustment ensures that operations like paying an invoice before receiving it are no longer possible."
