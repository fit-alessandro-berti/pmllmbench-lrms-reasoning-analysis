    "Text": "First, the process starts with market research and R&D, then moves to securing components from different countries. Theres a parallel gateway for component sourcing, which splits into four tasks. After securing all components, they ship to Malaysia for assembly. Then theres a quality check with an exclusive gateway for rework or scrap. Packaging follows, then shipping via air or cargo, customs clearance, distribution to regions, local warehousing, and different distribution channels. Finally, inventory monitoring and adjusting orders or proceeding to the next sales cycle."
