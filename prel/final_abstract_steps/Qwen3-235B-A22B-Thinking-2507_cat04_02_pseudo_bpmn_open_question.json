    "Text": "For redesign I should focus on three pillars prediction to route smarter automation to eliminate manual steps and adaptability to handle edge cases Let me brainstorm First the XOR gateway for request type is problematic Instead of binary classification we could use ML to predict customization likelihood during intake That way highrisk requests get routed to specialists early Ill add a Predictive Triage subprocess here Second the parallel checks Task C1C2 are manual but could be automated with APIs Credit checks can pull from financial systems inventory from ERP no human needed And we should add realtime monitoring so if one check lags it triggers alerts Third the approval loop is inefficient Instead of looping back after rejection we could have conditional approvals lowrisk custom requests autoapproved highrisk routed to managers And for rejections add a quick fix option to avoid restarting the whole process Fourth the custom path needs more flexibility Instead of a single feasibility analysis we could have modular checks like breaking customization into components design sourcing etc so only problematic parts get escalated"
