    "Text": "Lets break down the anomalies from the provided model: Anomaly 1: (R, P): Average time ~1.04 days (90000 seconds) with a very low standard deviation of 1 hour (3600 seconds).    - This is suspicious because the standard deviation is very low compared to the average, meaning the time between Receive and Approve is very consistent, which might indicate an automated or rigid schedule that does not account for the complexity of the process. Anomaly 2: (P, N): Average time 7 days (604800 seconds) with a high standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds).    - This is a long delay with high variability, which might indicate a bottleneck or inconsistent process in notifying customers after approval. Anomaly 3: (A, C): Average time 2 hours (7200 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 hour (3600 seconds).    - This is a relatively quick closure after assignment, which might indicate that some claims are closed without going through the necessary steps (like Evaluate and Approve) or that these steps are being skipped. Anomaly 4: (E, N): Average time 5 minutes (300 seconds) with a standard deviation of 1 minute (60 seconds).    - This is a very quick transition from Evaluate to Notify, which might indicate an automated notification system that triggers immediately after evaluation, but it might be too fast if there are other steps required (like approval) in between."

    "Text": "For each anomaly, we can:   - Compute the actual time between the two activities for each claim.   - Compare with the expected range (average ± k * standard deviation) to find outliers. Well use k=2 for a rough cutoff (about 95% confidence if normal distribution)."

    "Text": "Note: The claim_events table has a timestamp column for each event. We need to get the first occurrence of each activity for the claim. We can use MIN() with CASE statements to get the first timestamp for each activity. Example for (R, P):   SELECT     claim_id,     MIN(CASE WHEN activity = R THEN timestamp END) AS R_timestamp,     MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) AS P_timestamp  FROM claim_events  GROUP BY claim_id  HAVING MIN(CASE WHEN activity = R THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL     AND MIN(CASE WHEN activity = P THEN timestamp END) IS NOT NULL"

    "Text": "Then, we can compute the difference and filter by the expected range. However, note that the temporal profile model might be built on the entire history, but we are looking for deviations. We can compute the actual average and standard deviation for the entire dataset and then compare with the model, or we can look for individual claims that are outside the expected range. Since the prompt asks to identify specific claims where the time between activities falls outside expected ranges, well do that. Lets write a query for each anomaly pair. Well use a common table expression (CTE) to get the timestamps for each activity per claim, then compute the difference and filter. Well also join with the claims table to get additional information (like claim_type, customer_id, claim_amount) and with the adjusters table if needed (via the resource in claim_events)."
