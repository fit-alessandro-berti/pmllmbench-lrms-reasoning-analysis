Sequence must be: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] Close Case 2. Specific ordering rules: - Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. - Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision. - Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. - If approved: Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case. - If rejected: do not finalize documentation before closing the case. What is not allowed: - Skipping activities in the sequence. - Changing the order (e.g., Risk Assessment before Credit Check). - Performing Finalize Documentation after a rejection. - Closing the case without following the decision logic. Desiderata (Recommended): 1. Credit Check should be completed within 24 hours after application is received. 2. Inform Applicant should be done within 48 hours of the loan decision. 3. It is encouraged to perform a Follow-up Call before closing the case (but not required)."

Yes (same day, within 30 minutes) Risk Assessment (2024-01-10 10:00) -> after Credit Check? Yes Loan Decision (Approved) (2024-01-10 11:00) -> after Risk Assessment? Yes Inform Applicant (2024-01-10 13:00) -> after Loan Decision? Yes (within 2 hours, so within 48 hours) Finalize Documentation (2024-01-10 13:30) -> because approved, and before Close Case? Yes Close Case (2024-01-10 14:00) Normative rules: - Sequence is correct: Application Received -> Credit Check -> Risk Assessment -> Loan Decision -> Inform Applicant -> Finalize Documentation -> Close Case (and since approved, finalize is required). - No violations. Desiderata: - Credit Check within 24 hours: yes (30 minutes after application). - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of loan decision: loan decision at 11:00, inform at 13:00 same day -> within 2 hours, so yes. - Follow-up Call: not present, but it's only recommended. So this is a desideratum violation? Actually, the desideratum says sometime before closing the case, but it's not present. However, it's not a strict rule. So we note that it's missing but it's not a normative violation."

    "Text": "Case 2: - Activities: Application Received (2024-01-11 08:00) Risk Assessment (2024-01-11 08:20) -> This is before Credit Check? Yes, and Credit Check hasn't happened yet -> violates normative rule: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Credit Check (2024-01-11 09:00) -> now happens after Risk Assessment -> which is out of order. Loan Decision (Rejected) (2024-01-11 09:30) Finalize Documentation (2024-01-11 10:00) -> but loan was rejected -> normative violation: should not finalize documentation after rejection. Close Case (2024-01-11 10:30) Normative violations: 1. Ordering: Risk Assessment was done before Credit Check (violates Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment). 2. After rejection, they performed Finalize Documentation (which is not allowed). Desiderata: - Credit Check: happened at 09:00, which is 1 hour after application (08:00) -> within 24 hours? Yes (1 hour). - Inform Applicant: missing? Wait, the log does not have Inform Applicant activity at all. But normative rule requires that Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. So skipping an activity (Inform Applicant) is a normative violation? Let me check the log: Case 2: Application Received Risk Assessment Credit Check Loan Decision (Rejected) Finalize Documentation Close Case We don't see Inform Applicant. This is a violation of the normative sequence: the step Inform Applicant is skipped. So actually, there are three normative violations in Case 2: a) Skipped Inform Applicant (which is required in the sequence). b) Ordering: Risk Assessment before Credit Check. c) Finalize Documentation after rejection."

Since approved, Finalize Documentation is required and it is done before Close Case. Check order: Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes. Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes. Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes (but late, which is only desideratum). Finalize Documentation after approval: yes, and before Close Case. So no normative violations.

    "Text": "Summary: Normative Violations: - Case 1: None. - Case 2: 1. Skipped Inform Applicant (required step). 2. Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check (order violation). 3. Finalize Documentation performed after rejection (not allowed). - Case 3: None. Desiderata Violations: - Case 1: Missing Follow-up Call (but note: the desideratum says sometime before closing, so missing it is a violation of the recommendation). However, the log does not show it. Also, timing for Credit Check and Inform Applicant were good. - Case 2: - Credit Check was within 24 hours? Actually, it was done within 1 hour -> so no timing violation for Credit Check. - Inform Applicant: skipped -> so we cannot check timing, but skipping is a normative violation so we don't consider desiderata for timing of this step? Actually, the desiderata for timing of Inform Applicant would only apply if the step exists. Since it doesn't, we don't have a desideratum violation for timing of Inform Applicant? But note: the desiderata says applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision) - but if the step is skipped, then the desideratum about timing doesn't apply because the step is missing. However, the main issue is the normative violation of skipping the step. - Follow-up call: missing -> violation of desideratum. - Case 3: - Credit Check: took 49 hours (>24) -> violation. - Inform Applicant: took 51 hours (>48) -> violation. - Follow-up call: missing -> violation."

    "Text": "Suggestions for interpretations: Case 2: The normative violations are severe. The process did not follow the required sequence. Why might this happen? - Perhaps an error: the Risk Assessment was done by mistake before the Credit Check. - Also, the step Inform Applicant was skipped entirely. This might be an oversight. - Finalizing documentation for a rejected loan might be a mistake (maybe the employee did not update the system correctly). Case 3: The delays might be due to high workload or a backlog. The missing follow-up call might be because the team was busy. Since these are only desiderata, it's not a critical issue but indicates areas for improvement. Case 1: It followed the normative rules and met the timing desiderata, but the follow-up call was missing. Why? Maybe the team decided that for a straightforward approval, a follow-up call was not necessary? Or it might be an oversight. Note: The desiderata violations are not severe, but they represent suboptimal behavior (delays and missing an optional step)."
