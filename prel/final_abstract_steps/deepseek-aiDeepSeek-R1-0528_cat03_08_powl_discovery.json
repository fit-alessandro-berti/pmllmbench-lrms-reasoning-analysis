However, note that in the loop definition, after the first A, we either exit or do B and then A again. So the sequence AS -> IQC -> AS is: First AS (the first time) -> then we choose to do B (IQC) and then A (AS) again.

However, note the timestamps: AS (10:00) -> IQC (10:15) -> IQC (10:30) -> AS (10:45) So after the first IQC at 10:15, we have another IQC at 10:30 and then AS at 10:45.

But note: after the IQC loop, we must go back to AS? However, the loop operator doesnt allow that: the second child is a single activity (or a POWL model) that is executed and then we go back to the first child. So: Loop1 = * ( AS, IQC_Loop ) where IQC_Loop = * ( IQC, skip ) [meaning: do IQC, then either exit (and then we go back to AS? but note: after IQC_Loop we go back to AS) or do skip?
