If there's sufficient inventory, they should do Authorize Payment → Package items → Ship order → Close order. If not, they go Cancel order → Close order."

That's a problem because according to the rules, authorize should come before package. So this violates the order. They packaged without authorizing payment first. Also, shipping after that would be okay if they had authorized properly, but since packaging was done out of order, it’s a violation."

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive → Check → Authorize → Cancel → Ship → Close. Wait, here they canceled the order but then shipped afterwards. The normative process says once you cancel, you shouldn't ship because cancellation implies insufficient inventory and no fulfillment steps should follow. So shipping after cancel is definitely a violation. Also, why authorize payment if they are going to cancel? That seems odd. Maybe even authorizing before knowing inventory was sufficient or not?"

Skipping packaging and going straight to shipping is a violation because packaging is required before shipping. Also, no mention of canceling or insufficient inventory here—maybe the inventory was sufficient but they skipped steps."
