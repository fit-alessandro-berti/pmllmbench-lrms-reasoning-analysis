In process trees, loops are defined with a 'do' part and a 'redo' part... * ( A, B ) is a loop. So the process tree A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again... In this scenario, the loop body includes SC, then exclusive choice of TM or SPT, then RDT. And the decision to loop back is based on RDT results. But RDT is part of the loop. Mapping to * (A, B): A might be the main part... B is the part that might be executed before looping back... There's a mismatch. Perhaps it's better to have A as the entire body... Perhaps I need to use a silent step or something for the decision... I think for this, I can set A as the sequence of SC, exclusive choice of TM or SPT, and then the RDT exclusive choice... I could use B as an empty process or just not add a label, but I think using tau is appropriate for silent decisions... I'll go with that: for the loop, * (A, tau), where A is -> (SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA))."

Start with sequence... -> (A, RG, IA) -> (TI -> TC) -> X(CE, FBP) -> [loop part] -> ... The loop part is after X(CE, FBP), and it's conditional on abnormal results... 'If the results are abnormal, a loop commences...' So there's a decision after the initial diagnostic test... I need an XOR after the initial test... After X(CE, FBP), there is an exclusive choice (based on results): Option 1: abnormal - then enter the loop... Option 2: normal - then proceed directly (perhaps with a tau or nothing)... In process trees, I can have an XOR with two children: one is the loop part, the other is tau (silent step, meaning no visible activity). Then, after the XOR, the sequence continues. Yes, that should work."
