How long does it take from SS to OP? Probably a short time, maybe a few hours. Let's say average 3600 seconds (1 hour) with a low standard deviation of 600 seconds. Then OP to RC: This is the lead time for the supplier. Suppose it's about a week, so 604800 seconds (7 days). Standard deviation could be a couple of days, say 172800 seconds (2 days). RC to QI: Once components are received, inspection might take a day or so. Let's say 86400 seconds (1 day) with some variation, so standard deviation 3600 seconds. QI to CA: After inspection, assembly starts. Maybe a couple of days, 172800 seconds, with some variability, so standard deviation 86400. CA to PT: Testing after assembly might take a day or two, so 86400 average and 3600 standard deviation. PT to PK: Packaging after testing is quick, maybe a few hours, 10800 seconds average, low standard deviation of 1800. PK to WS: Storing in the warehouse is quick, maybe a few hours, 7200 seconds average, standard deviation 1800. WS to DT: Distribution might take a couple of days, 172800 seconds average, with some variation, standard deviation 86400. DT to AS: After distribution, after-sales support starts. This could be almost immediate, so maybe a day, 86400 seconds, with some variation, standard deviation 3600."

    "Text": "Now, considering pairs that are not directly connected. For example, SS to RC: How long from selecting a supplier to receiving components? This would be SS OP RC, so the time from SS to OP plus OP to RC. If SS to OP is 1 hour and OP to RC is 7 days, total is about 7 days and 1 hour. So average 604800 + 3600 = 608400 seconds, standard deviation would be the sum of the individual standard deviations squared, but since we're estimating, maybe 172800 + 600 = 173400, but that's not accurate. Alternatively, we can estimate it as the same as OP to RC's standard deviation, which was 172800, so maybe 172800. Wait, but actually, the standard deviation of the sum of independent variables is the square root of the sum of their variances. So if SS to OP has a standard deviation of 600 and OP to RC has 172800, the variance for SS to RC would be (600)^2 + (172800)^2. The square root of that would be approximately 172803. But since we're estimating, maybe just take the larger one, 172800."
