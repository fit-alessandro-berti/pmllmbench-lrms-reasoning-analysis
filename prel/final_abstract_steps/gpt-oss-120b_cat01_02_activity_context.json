Call Customer appears multiple times with different purposes (request missing docs, clarify discrepancy, follow-up, return request). Adjust Account appears multiple times across cases but maybe only once per case? In C002 and C003 each have Adjust Account once. So only Verify Documents and Call Customer need renaming. Also maybe Initiate Request appears once per case, no need. Approve Request once."
