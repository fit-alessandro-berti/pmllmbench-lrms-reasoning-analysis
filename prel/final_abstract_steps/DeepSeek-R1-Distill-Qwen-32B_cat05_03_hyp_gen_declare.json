    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the main anomalies are 1 The noncoexistence constraint between E and C is incorrect because it prevents them from cooccurring which is necessary Instead it should be a precedence constraint ensuring E comes before C 2 The model lacks constraints that enforce the correct order between E P N and C For example after E comes P then N then C The current model doesnt capture this so claims could be closed without going through approval or notification 3 The respondedexistence for E with A is correct but perhaps there are other activities that should be responded to For example A should be responded by E but maybe other steps like P should be responded by N etc"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
