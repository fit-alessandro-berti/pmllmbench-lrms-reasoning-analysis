But the loop operator * (A, B) is defined as: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again, repeating until exit. So for * (AS, IQC), it would be: do AS, then either stop or do IQC and then AS again. So the possible sequences are: - AS (exit immediately) - AS -> IQC -> AS (exit after one loop) - AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS (exit after two loops), etc. Which matches the observed behavior."

Therefore, the StrictPartialOrder at the root would have nodes = [OR, MS, QS, loop1, loop2, PK, lb_choice, DP, D] and order = OR->MS, MS->QS, QS->loop1, loop1->loop2, loop2->PK, PK->lb_choice, lb_choice->DP, DP->D."

Wait, looking at Case 3: | 3 | AS | ... | 3 | IQC | ... | 3 | IQC | ... <--- Wait, two IQCs in a row? ... But given the operator definitions, the loop * (A, B) is A followed by optional (B -> A). So if A is AS and B is IQC, then you can't have two IQCs in a row; it would be AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC etc. So two IQCs in a row wouldn't be possible. Therefore, the Case 3 log must have a typo. Given that, I'll proceed under the assumption that the intended sequence is AS -> IQC -> AS -> IQC etc., so the loop * (AS, IQC) is correct."
