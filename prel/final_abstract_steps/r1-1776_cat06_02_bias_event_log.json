C003 had 715 as non-local and was rejected."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - IND",
    "Text": "But how does that tie into the adjustments? The main explicit bias here is the +10 adjustment for being in Highland Civic Darts Club. This directly affects their scores and could lead to approvals they wouldnt get otherwise (like C004 going from 690 to 700)."

    "Text": "Additionally, looking at outcomes for non-locals: only one case (C005) was approved because their score was high enough (740). The other non-local case (C003) had a lower score (715) and was rejected. But if locals with similar scores would be approved? Wait: Are there any local cases without community group that have scores around 715? Looking at locals without community group: only C002 has PreliminaryScore of 720 which was approved without adjustment. Theres no local case here with a score around 715 without community group to compare. But if we assume that locals without community group need to have their preliminary score as-is (since they dont get adjustments), then perhaps locals need to reach a certain threshold (maybe >=700?), while non-locals need higher? But in this data: Locals: C001: Adjusted to 720 Approved C002: No adjustment (720) Approved C004: Adjusted to 700 Approved Non-locals: C003: No adjustment (715) Rejected C005: No adjustment (740) Approved So maybe the cutoff is lower for locals (700) than for non-locals (maybe around >=730?). That would explain why C003 at 715 was rejected but a local with same or lower would be approved if adjusted via community. Alternatively, perhaps other factors during manual review affect it. However, in ManualReview activity entries for all cases except perhaps adjustments via CommunityGroup dont show other score changes except whats done in PreliminaryScoring. Therefore, two main points of bias: 1. CommunityGroup-based adjustments giving +10 points only to members of Highland Civic Darts Club. This favors applicants from that group regardless of actual credit factors. 2. Possible geographic bias against non-local residents requiring higher scores for approval compared to locals who may benefit from lower thresholds or additional adjustments. This creates unfairness because individuals not in the favored community or who arent local residents may need higher inherent creditworthiness to achieve similar outcomes. For example: A local applicant in Highland could get approval with a lower initial score due to the +10 boost. A non-local applicant needs a much higher preliminary score (like 740) compared to locals who might get approved at lower scores (like 700). This systemic bias disadvantages those without such affiliations or geographic statuses even if their creditworthiness is comparable."
