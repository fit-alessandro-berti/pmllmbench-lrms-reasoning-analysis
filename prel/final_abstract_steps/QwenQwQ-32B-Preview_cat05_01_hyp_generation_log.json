I have four cases here, each with a series of activities performed at different times by different resources. There's also some additional information like channel, credit scores, and amounts. First, I need to understand the normal flow of the process."

Possibilities include: - Human error: workers might not be following the standard procedure. - System flaws: the system might allow activities to be recorded out of order. - Process optimizations: perhaps in some cases, steps are reordered to improve efficiency, but this needs to be managed carefully. - Rush orders: for priority orders, steps might be overlapped or reordered, but this should be controlled."
