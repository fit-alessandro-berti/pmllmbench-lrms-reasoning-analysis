Create Purchase Requisition 2. Approve Purchase Requisition 3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) 4. Receive Goods (after supplier ships) 5. Vendor Invoice Received 6. Match Invoice to PO (3-way match: PO, goods receipt, invoice) 7. Release Payment 8. Close Case"

All timestamps are in logical order with reasonable gaps like goods received a day after PO, which makes sense for shipping time."

    "Text": "Next, Case 1002. Hmm, this one jumps out. After creating the requisition at 08:30, it immediately issues the PO at 08:40 skipping approval? Then at 07:00 next day (Feb 3), invoice is received and payment released within 15 minutes! But approval happens much later at 08:00 on the same day as payment? Thats backwards. Approval should come before PO issuance. Also, goods are received on Feb 4, after payment? Thats a major red flag paying before receiving goods violates basic controls. And matching the invoice happens days after payment? Payment should only happen after matching. This case has multiple violations: no pre-PO approval, payment before goods receipt, and matching after payment."

How can you pay without an invoice? Then goods are received on Feb 10, after payment. And matching happens on Feb 11, post-payment. This sequence is completely inverted. Payment should be the last step after matching."

You cant receive goods without a PO first; the supplier needs the PO to ship. Also, invoice received next day, matched, paid all after goods receipt but PO was issued after goods arrived? This suggests goods were received without a formal PO, which breaks procurement controls. Might indicate maverick buying or unauthorized purchases."

    "Text": "Now, why are these problematic? For Case 1002: Payment before goods receipt could mean paying for undelivered goods (supplier fraud) or inventory loss. Skipping approval enables unauthorized spending. For Case 1003: Paying without invoice leads to incorrect amounts or duplicate payments. For Case 1004: Receiving without PO makes it hard to verify legitimacy could be unauthorized purchases or missing documentation for audits."
