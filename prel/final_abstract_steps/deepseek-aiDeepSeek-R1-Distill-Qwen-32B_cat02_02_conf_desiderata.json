    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "First, Ill look at the normative constraints. The process must follow a strict sequence: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [If Approved: Finalize Documentation] Close Case. There are specific ordering rules that cant be skipped or reversed. Also, certain activities are only allowed under specific conditions, like finalizing documentation only if the loan is approved."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, lets look at each case one by one. Case 1: Activities in order: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. Timestamps are sequential, and each activity follows the correct order. No issues here. It seems to comply fully with the normative rules."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 2: The sequence is: Application, Risk Assessment (without Credit Check first), then Credit Check, Loan Decision (Rejected), Finalize Documentation, Close Case. The problem here is that Risk Assessment happened before Credit Check, which violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Also, after the loan was rejected, they still finalized documentation, which is not allowed. So, Case 2 definitely has normative violations."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3: The process starts with Application, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case. The normative sequence is followed correctly. However, the Credit Check happened two days later, which is more than 24 hours after the application, violating the desideratum. Also, Inform Applicant was done two days after the Loan Decision, exceeding the recommended 48 hours. Additionally, theres no Follow-up Call, which is another desideratum. So, Case 3 doesnt violate the strict rules but fails some best practices."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, to answer the questions: 1. Which cases violate normative rules? Case 2 violates because it did Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalized documentation after rejection. 2. Which cases fail desiderata? Case 3 fails because Credit Check was late, Inform Applicant was delayed, and no Follow-up Call. 3. Justifications: For Case 2, maybe there was an urgent need or a system error that caused the order to be mixed up. The documentation finalization after rejection might have been a mistake. For Case 3, delays could be due to processing backlogs or resource issues. The lack of a Follow-up Call might be an oversight or considered unnecessary in this case."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think that covers all the points. I need to make sure Im not missing any other violations. Let me double-check each case against the normative constraints again. Case 1: All activities in correct order and no extra steps. Good. Case 2: Wrong order and unauthorized documentation. Definitely a violation. Case 3: Correct order but missed the timing and follow-up. Just desiderata issues. I think thats it. Now, I can structure the answer accordingly."
