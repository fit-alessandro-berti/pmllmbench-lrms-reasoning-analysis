C005 is Non-Resident with No Club and got Approved (Score 740). So, being a Non-Resident isnt an automatic rejection. The bias is specifically tied to the Club adjustment which correlates with residency in this dataset. Check: Is the Manual Review biased? Reviewers vary (#7, #3, #4, #2, #5). The decision seems driven by the Rules Engine based on the Adjusted Score. The reviewers didnt override the score logic; they seemingly validated it. The bias is embedded in the Scoring Engine logic (the +10 rule)."

C004 Final: 700 -> Approved. C003 Final: 715 -> Rejected. Gap: 15 points. This confirms the adjustment isnt just a tie-breaker; it changes the outcome fundamentally."
