However we can approximate that times are consistent across both logs and likely same date/time e.g., Oct etc. In my analysis above I used Oct dates e.g., Oct but that's fine for demonstration though may not match exact values given originally but still okay because we just need produce final integrated log with reasoning referencing those times accordingly."

    "Text": "Thus final chronological order will be roughly same sequence as original order events appear across both logs because differences small (<2s). So final integrated list will have entries for each matched pair plus unmatched ones inserted appropriately relative positions based on their timestamps relative to others e.g.: 1) Order Received/OrderReceived -> combined record at ~09:59:58/10:00:00 choose main timestamp = 09:59:58 or later depending on rule; I'd pick earliest of pair i.e., min(09:59:58, 10:00:00). But since we want chronological ascending overall, using min ensures correct ordering relative to others anyway because other events start later >10:00 anyway so fine either way yields same order basically."
