The same activity name appears multiple times within a case, but each occurrence has a different context. My goal is to rename these activities so their names clearly reflect their different contexts."

But then, after the customer submits additional documents, there's another \"Verify Documents.\" This time, the agent is re-checking the documents because the customer provided more info. So, the first one is an initial verification, and the second is a re-verification."

So, the names should capture that. - For \"Call Customer,\" the first time it's often an initial contact or clarification, and the second time it's a follow-up after some action (like submitting documents or an adjustment). So, the names should reflect the purpose of the call."

I can apply this pattern across all cases where these activities repeat."
