    "Text": "This can be considered as bias because the system appears to value professional associations over merit and inherent qualities like skill or personality scores that might not differ significantly between candidates It gives an extra advantage to individuals who are already wellconnected which may lead to unfair treatment of equally qualified candidates who do not have such affiliations This can also cause issues with fairness as it discriminates against candidates based on social networks rather than performance metrics"

    "Text": "I need to mention that this bias could be considered a type of discrimination if the protected group systematically lacks access to these professional networks or if these adjustments are not applied equitably Also note that the term protected usually denotes groups that are legally protected from discrimination so theres an ethical question if Group A is a protected group and they do not receive any boost while Group B candidates potentially nonprotected get such adjustments then this constitutes bias in favor of one group over another"
