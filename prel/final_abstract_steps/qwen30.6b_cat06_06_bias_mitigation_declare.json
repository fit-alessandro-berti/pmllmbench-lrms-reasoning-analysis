    "Text": "First, the example given in the model includes \"coexistence\" and \"precedence\" constraints. The user mentioned adding constraints that enforce fairness. So I need to think about specific scenarios where bias could happen. For instance, if a decision step like \"Reject\" comes right after checking a sensitive attribute, that's a problem."

    "Text": "Wait, the original model includes \"precedence\" as a binary constraint. Maybe I can add a new constraint for \"precedence\" to require that the successor activity has a \"BiasCheck\" check. But how to structure that?"

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Also, for the coexistence constraint, the example has \"StartApplication\" and \"FinalDecision\" as a pair. So maybe adding a new constraint that requires that \"ManualReview\" is always present when a decision step is involved with a sensitive attribute. That would mean if there's a step like \"Approve_Minority\", then the \"ManualReview\" activity must coexist."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So putting this all together, the new constraints would be:\n\n- Coexistence: Ensure that when a decision step is for a sensitive attribute, a \"ManualReview\" activity is present.\n- Response or Succession: Ensure that decision steps like \"Approve\" and \"Reject\" do not immediately follow or precede a sensitive attribute check."

So for \"response\", perhaps adding a constraint that requires a \"BiasCheck\" activity to be in place. Similarly, for \"precedence\", adding a constraint that requires a \"BiasCheck\" activity to be in place."
