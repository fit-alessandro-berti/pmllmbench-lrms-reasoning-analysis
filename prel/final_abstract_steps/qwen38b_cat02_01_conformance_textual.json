    "Text": "Case 3 Sequence Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close Oh here after Cancel they did Ship Order But according to the norm after Cancel the next step should be Close Order Shipping after cancellation is a violation The norm states that Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after cancellation So this case is invalid"
