So the model needs to allow for a loop where RMI and VF can repeat. Also, the main flow is RA followed by VF, then AE, then possibly a loop, then AD, SC, AC."

    "Text": "This doesn't fit. Because in the logs, after RMI, VF is always done. So perhaps the loop is structured as a sequence where after AE, there's a loop that allows RMI and VF to occur any number of times (including zero), but each RMI must be followed by VF. How to model this. Alternatively, perhaps the loop is designed such that: After AE, there's a loop where the body is RMI followed by VF, and this can occur zero or more times. So that would be modeled as a loop where the main path allows for repeating the RMI and VF steps."
