    "Text": "The reasoning identifies repeated patterns across different cases (A1 and B2): retrieving raw material, scanning a barcode, placing on a table, aligning, preheating, welding corners, checking welds, coating, drying, and a final visual inspection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "By examining the sequence of events in cases A1 and B2, the reasoning generalizes that these events are grouped into distinct high-level steps: Material Preparation, Assembly, Coating Application, and Quality Inspection. Events with similar purpose and temporal proximity are grouped together."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The reasoning checks proposed groupings against the event log structure, ensuring each low-level event is included in exactly one high-level step and that all steps occur in logical order with no overlap."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The reasoning uses domain knowledge and provided examples, such as 'Material Preparation' and 'Quality Inspection,' to define meaningful high-level process steps relevant to manufacturing workflows."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The reasoning validates the groupings by analyzing whether the chronological order of events and the involved resources (e.g., Operator A, Coating Unit) support their inclusion in specific high-level steps."
