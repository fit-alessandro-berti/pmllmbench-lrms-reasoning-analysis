    "Text": "Okay, lets tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative rules and the desiderata for each case. Let me start by recalling the key points from Part 1 and Part 2. Normative Rules Strict Rules: - The sequence must be: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant If Approved: Finalize Documentation Close Case. - Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. - Risk Assessment before Loan Decision. - Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. - If approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. If rejected, no Finalize Documentation before closing. Desiderata Recommended but Not Strict: - Credit Check within 24 hours of Application Received. - Inform Applicant within 48 hours of Loan Decision. - Follow-up Call before closing optional, not required."

    "Text": "Now, looking at the event log for each case. Case 1: - Timestamps: Application Received at 09:00, then Credit Check at 09:30, Risk Assessment at 10:00, Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00, Finalize Documentation at 13:30, Close Case at 14:00. - Let me check the sequence. All steps follow the correct order. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, etc. Also, after Loan Decision, Inform Applicant is done, then Finalize Documentation since its approved, then Close Case. No issues here. Desiderata: Credit Check was within 30 minutes, so thats fine. Inform Applicant was 2 hours after decision, which is within 48 hours. No follow-up call, but thats not required. So Case 1 is compliant with all rules and desiderata."

    "Text": "Case 2: - Application Received at 08:00, then Risk Assessment at 08:20 no Credit Check yet. Thats a violation of the normative rule that Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then Credit Check is done at 09:00, but the Risk Assessment was already done before. Also, the Loan Decision is Rejected, but then Finalize Documentation is done at 10:00, which is not allowed after rejection. So two normative violations here. The order is wrong Risk before Credit, and Finalize Documentation after rejection. The desiderata arent violated here since the main issues are normative."

    "Text": "Case 3: - Application Received at 09:00. Credit Check at 14:00 more than 24 hours later, which violates the desideratum. Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision approved, Inform Applicant at 16:00, which is 2 days after the decision decision was at 14:00 on 14th, inform at 16:00 on 16th, thats 48 hours? Wait, the decision was on 14th at 12:00 14:00 is 14:00, so 14th at 12:00? Wait, the event log says: Wait, let me check the timestamps again for Case 3. Case 3: - Application Received: 2024-01-12 09:00 - Credit Check: 2024-01-14 10:00 so 2 days later, which is more than 24 hours, violating the desideratum - Risk Assessment: 2024-01-14 11:00 - Loan Decision: 2024-01-14 12:00 - Inform Applicant: 2024-01-16 15:00 which is 2 days after the decision, which is 48 hours? Lets see: decision was on 14th at 12:00. Inform is 16th at 15:00. So thats 2 days and 3 hours. The desideratum says within 48 hours, which is 2 days. So this is 2 days and 3 hours, which is beyond 48 hours. So thats a desideratum violation. Also, no follow-up call. But the normative rules are followed: sequence is correct. So Case 3 has desiderata issues but no normative violations."

    "Text": "So, summarizing: Normative Violations: - Case 2: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize Documentation after rejection. - Case 1: No violations. - Case 3: No normative violations. Desiderata Violations: - Case 2: No desiderata issues since those are not strict. - Case 3: Credit Check was 2 days after application, which violates the 24-hour recommendation. Also, Inform Applicant was 2 days and 3 hours after decision, which is beyond the 48-hour recommendation. Also, no follow-up call, but thats not required. So the answer should list which cases have normative violations, then which have desiderata issues. Wait, but the desiderata are recommended but not strict. So for Case 3, the Credit Check was 2 days after application, which is a desideratum violation. Also, Inform Applicant was 2 days and 3 hours after the decision, which is beyond the 48-hour recommendation which is 2 days. So thats a desideratum violation. Also, no follow-up call. But the follow-up is not required, so thats not a violation. So the desiderata violations are the two timing issues. So for the answer: 1. Normative violations: Case 2. 2. Desiderata violations: Case 3 Credit Check delay, Inform delay. Now, the user might want explanations and possible justifications. For example, Case 2s Risk Assessment before Credit Check could be a mistake, maybe a typo in the log? But the user says to explain the reasons. So for Case 2, the order is wrong, which is a normative violation. For Case 3, the desiderata are not met, but they are not strict. So the final answer should list these points. Also, perhaps in the desiderata part, need to mention that even though the follow-up call is not required, its recommended. So Case 3 didnt do it, but thats not a problem."
