Similarly, B2 spans from 08:00:05 to 08:01:50. This suggests that events within the same time frame are likely part of the same process step."

It could be part of a material preparation step. - Scan barcode: Scanning is likely an assembly action, maybe part of material handling or quality check. - Place metal sheet: Placing could be part of manufacturing or assembly. - Align metal sheet: Alignment is a precise action, possibly in an assembly or quality control. - Preheat metal sheet: Preheating might be part of quality control or assembly. - Welding actions: These are more involved, so they might be part of an assembly step or possibly an inspection. - Inspect weld integrity: This could be a quality check. - Apply protective coating: Another assembly step. - Visual check: This could be a quality check. - Dry coating: Another quality check."

Similarly, from 08:00:15 to 08:01:00, we have pick up welding tool, weld corner A, weld corner B, measure weld integrity, apply protective coating, and dry coating. These are welding-related actions, so they might be part of an assembly step involving welding."
