impossible Because after receiving the ticket at 0820 how can it go back to triage That suggests maybe a typo in the data entry Ah Wait no this must be an error because each case should have sequential activities without looping back So perhaps theres a mistake here Let me check again Looking at Case 104s events as per users table First event Receive Ticket 0820 Second Triage Ticket 0900 40 minutes later Third Assign to Level-1 Agent 0930 But then the next activity under case 104 would be Investigate Issue at 1300 same day Wait thats possible So after assign theres a gap until investigate starts But that doesnt make sense because typically triage comes before assigning Wait maybe there was an error in how Im reading the data Alternatively perhaps Case 104s events are misordered here Let me recheck The users table lists each row as part of their case ID So for example under Case ID column rows with IDs 101 to 105 show up sequentially Wait no the user provided a list where Cases start from 101 and go down in order but not necessarily consecutive numbers Wait the actual data presented Looking at the users table as given here the block of text its structured such that each case is listed under its ID For example Case 101 has six events starting with Receive Ticket followed by triage assign etc until close Similarly for Cases 102 to 105 So in reality when looking at the users table as presented here noted earlier perhaps I misread how cases are structured because of formatting issues Let me re-examine The initial data block provided is a list where each case starts with Case ID followed by its events For example 101 Receive Ticket then Assign to Level-1 Agent etc up to Close Ticket Then 102s first event is Received at 0805 Then next entries under Case 102 are Triage Assign Escalate Investigate Resolve Close So thats six events for each case except maybe some have more Wait no each ticket case has multiple steps so the number of rows per case depends on how many activities that particular ticket had For example Case 101 from Receive to Assign is three steps then Investigate Resolve Close So total five events Wait lets count Case 101s events as listed in the users table assuming each row under a case ID represents an event 1 2024-03-01 0800 Receive Ticket 2 2024-03-01 0810 Triage Ticket 3 2024-03-01 0820 Assign to Level-1 Agent 4 2024-03-01 0900 Investigate Issue 5 2024-03-01 1000 Resolve Ticket 6 2024-03-01 1015 Close Ticket Total of six events Or is each step considered one event so maybe the first case 101 has five steps from receive to close But regardless when calculating total resolution time for a case we take the difference between the earliest and latest timestamp across all its events So lets correct my earlier mistake with Case 104 Case 104s timeline is as follows 1 Receive Ticket 0820 2 Triage Ticket 0900 40 minutes later 3 Assign to Level-1 Agent 0930 Wait the users table for case 104 lists after assign next entries under Case 104 are Investigate Issue at 1300 same day Wait this is confusing because in reality triage should come before assigning So maybe theres a typo here where between Assign and Investigate there was an activity like Escalation or something else thats missing due to formatting errors when the data was pasted But given that I have to work with the provided data as-is perhaps Case 104s timeline is 1 Receive 0820 2 Triage 0900 40 min 3 Assign 0930 But then next activity under case 104 is Investigate Issue at 1300 same day This suggests that after assign 0930 theres a wait until investigate starts at 1300 which would be almost four hours of downtime before investigation begins That seems odd but perhaps its correct in the data provided Then Resolve Ticket on March 02 0800 and Close Ticket at 0830 same day next morning Wait no March 2nds times are after midnight from March 1st so if resolve is at 0800 on March 2nd that would be early morning Then close at 0830 So total time for Case 104 From first event 0820 March 1 to last close ticket at 0830 March 2 The duration here is from start of receive 0820 on day 1 to end of close 0830 next day Thats a bit over 24 hours But how long exactly From 0820 to midnight same day is 23h40m plus 0830 the next day totals 32h10m But thats not possible because March 2nds time of close is on the same night as receive since its at 0830 Wait no its actually from morning to late evening Wait receiving happens at 0820 on March 1st closing closes ticket at 0830 next day So total duration would be From 0820 March 1 to midnight 23h40m Then midnight to 0830 March 2 8h30m Total = 32 hours and 10 minutes But thats the same as Case 102s duration Wait no earlier I thought case 102 took over a day but now Im confused Let me recalculate each case properly"

the users table as presented earlier the initial block after receive ticket at 0805 triage is at 0830 Then assign to level-1 agent But then escalate next Wait theres confusion here because when I look back at how cases are structured in the provided data For example Case 101s events proceed as Receive Triage Assign Investigate etc with timestamps increasing Similarly for other cases But given that some tickets may require escalation and others dont this is normal So lets correctly parse each cases timeline from first to last event Rechecking the users provided data Case 102 has six events after receive 1 Receive Ticket 0805 2 Triage Ticket 0830 3 Assign to Level-1 Agent Wait no next after triage is assign but according to the data as given earlier in my initial analysis Wait this is getting too confusing without seeing the exact table structure However based on standard process steps Typically a tickets lifecycle would be Receive Triage Assign Investigate Resolve Escalation might occur after investigate or during assign depending on policy Assuming that for case 102 After triage at 0830 and assigned to Level-1 agent next event but then escalate That doesnt make sense So perhaps theres an error in how the data is presented here where between assign and escalated there are missing events due to formatting issues when pasting Alternatively maybe after assigning if escalation isnt required immediately those steps could be omitted from recording until actually performed But given that Case 102s timeline includes escalate at 1130 AM same day after triage then investigate starts next event which is the following activity So in this case between assign and escalated there might have been a gap where investigation started but wasnt recorded as such Or perhaps theres an unlogged delay This suggests that Case 102 took over two days from receive to close because after receiving at 0805 on March 1st the ticket was triaged by 0830 25 minutes later assigned same day Then escalated to Level-2 agent immediately That would be unusual but possible if policies require escalation even for level-1 assignments Wait no if assign is done by a Level-1 agent and then escalate from there that might indicate an issue in the workflow where tickets are always escalated after assignment causing delays Alternatively maybe during investigation which starts later they decide to escalate But according to Case 102s timeline After triage at 0830 assign is next event Wait no the data as presented earlier shows for case 102 the events in order are 1 Receive 0805 2 Triage 0830 3 Assign 0900 But then escalate happens later So after assign whats done first investigate or escalated Theres a gap here Alternatively perhaps theres an error and Assign to Level-1 Agent is followed by escalation without investigation in between Assuming that the data provided for case 102 skips some steps due to formatting like the Escalate row being separated then From receive at 0805 March 1st to escalate on 1130 AM same day Thats a gap of over three hours with no recorded activity except triage and assign Then after escalated investigate starts next event which is scheduled for 1400 2h30m later So from receive to investigation start date is the following mornings afternoon That would mean almost two days passed before starting investigation But in reality if escalate happens on March 1st at 1130 AM then maybe theres a waiting time until an agent becomes available Alternatively this suggests that after triage and assign there was no activity for several hours maybe agents were busy or process delays leading to escalation being initiated by system automatically without investigation But thats speculative For Case 104 Timeline from receive at 0820 March1 Triage at 0900 same day Then Assign Next event after assign would be Investigate Issue on the following afternoon 1300 So theres a long gap between assign and investigate starting This could indicate that investigation wasnt started promptly leading to delays Additionally for Case 104 From receive to close is from March1 0820 to next days 0830 which spans over midnight making it about 32 hours total if the last event is on March2 at 0830 This suggests that after triage and assign there was a significant delay before investigation began For example maybe agents were unavailable or other priorities took longer So potential root causes for Cases 102 and 104 1 Case 102 Escalation without Investigation If tickets are escalated to Level-2 agent but investigation hasnt started yet as per the gap between assign and escalate in some cases this could delay resolution Delays post-triage assign The ticket wasnt assigned properly or there was a backlog causing escalation after several hours 2 Case 104 Long Waiting Time Between Assign and Investigate From triage at 0900 to investigate start the next afternoon 1300 wait of about 4h20m Potentially unnecessary delays in investigation scheduling or agent availability"
