In * (A, B), A is the body, and B is for the loop part. Perhaps: A = -> (SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA)) And B = something, but in the prompt, its execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. To model the loop, I might need B to be empty or tau... No, the operator * (A, B) means: execute A, then choose to exit or execute B and then A again. So, for our case, A could be the full body, and B could be the body again, but that might not be right. Perhaps its better to think of A as the do part, and B as the redo part, which is the same as A. In standard process trees, for a loop like while condition, its modeled with the body as the main part. To simplify, Ill make the loop as * ( body, body ), where body is -> (SC, X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA)) That way, it executes body, then either exits or executes body again, and so on. Yes, that matches."
