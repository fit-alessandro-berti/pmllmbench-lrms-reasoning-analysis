Is there an escalation path? - How does the coordinator verify authenticity of documents? - What constitutes outdated for inspection reports? **Assignment:** - How is workload measured? (Number of properties, units, complexity score?) - What happens if no manager has the right geographic specialization? - How are unique requirements categorized and matched? - Who has final say in the assignment decision? **Inspection & Prep:** - What is the typical turnaround time between scheduling and actual inspection? - What severity levels exist for inspection issues? Which ones block progress vs. can be fixed later? - Who bears the cost of repairs - landlord or company? - What happens if the landlord refuses to make required repairs? **Marketing & Activation:** - How is pricing determined? Algorithm, committee, individual judgment? - What happens if market trends shift during the onboarding process? - How long does the marketing preparation typically take? - What determines which platforms/properties get brochures vs. just online listings? **Tenant Selection:** - What criteria differentiate suitable from unsuitable tenants beyond standard credit/background checks? - How are conflicts resolved when multiple tenants are interested? - What is the negotiation authority of the property manager for discounts? - What happens if no suitable tenants apply within a certain timeframe? **Governance:** - At what point do compliance and financial reviews occur? (Before or after lease signing?) - What happens if compliance or finance flags issues post-lease signing? - How are audit findings tracked and resolved? **Cross-cutting:** - What is the typical total duration from initial contact to tenant move-in? - What communication protocols exist when the process stalls? - How are custom lease clauses vetted? - What special insurance scenarios exist and how are they handled? - How is knowledge transferred if a property manager leaves mid-process? - What metrics measure success of this onboarding process? - What is the most common bottleneck or failure point?"
