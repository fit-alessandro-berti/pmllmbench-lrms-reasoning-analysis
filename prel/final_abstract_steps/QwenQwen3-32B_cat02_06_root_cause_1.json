The main delay here is between investigation and resolution. The Level-2 agent took 17 hours to resolve, which is long. Maybe Level-2 is understaffed or the issue is complex.

  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Possible root causes: \n1. Escalations leading to longer resolution times: Cases that required escalation (102, 105) had longer times. The time between escalation and investigation or resolution was significant. This could indicate that Level-2 agents are either understaffed, slow to respond, or the handoff between Level-1 and Level-2 is inefficient. \n2. Long waiting times between activities: In Cases 102, 104, 105, there are long gaps between when an activity is completed and the next one starts. For example, in Case 104, 13 hours between investigation and resolution. This could be due to agents not being available, tickets not being prioritized, or delays in the process. \n3. Inefficient investigation or resolution steps: Even in non-escalated cases (like 104), the resolution step took a long time. This might indicate that the agents are taking too long to resolve the issues, perhaps due to lack of training, complex issues, or other constraints. \n4. Delays in initial steps: In some cases, like Case 102, the triage and assignment steps took longer than average. For example, Case 102 was received at 08:05, triaged at 08:30 (25 minutes), assigned at 09:00 (another 30 minutes). That's 55 minutes for the initial steps, which is longer than the 5 minutes in Case 101 and 5 minutes in Case 103. Maybe the triage process is slow, leading to delays in assigning tickets to agents."

    "Text": "Recommendations:\n- Improve Escalation Process: Ensure that Level-2 agents are available to handle escalations promptly. Perhaps increase staffing in Level-2 or implement a more efficient handoff process between Level-1 and Level-2.\n- Reduce Waiting Times Between Activities: Implement a system to monitor and reduce the time between activities. For example, set service level agreements (SLAs) for each step to ensure tickets are not left unattended. Use automation to assign tickets immediately after triage.\n- Optimize Investigation and Resolution Steps: Provide training to agents to handle common issues more efficiently. Use knowledge bases or AI tools to speed up the resolution process. For cases that take too long, investigate the root cause and address bottlenecks.\n- Enhance Triage and Assignment Efficiency: Streamline the triage process to reduce the time before tickets are assigned to agents. Use automated triage tools if possible.\n- Monitor and Analyze Performance Metrics: Continuously track key metrics like time to triage, time to assign, time to escalate, and time to resolve. Use this data to identify patterns and address recurring issues."
