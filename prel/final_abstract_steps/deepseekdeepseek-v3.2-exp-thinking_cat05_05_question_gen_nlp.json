    "Text": "For RD, questions could explore how design choices impact the entire supply chain. For sourcing, it is important to address risks in global supplier networks. Manufacturing questions should consider flexibility and quality control. Logistics needs focus on resilience and cost-speed trade-offs. Distribution should examine regional strategies and last-mile challenges. Finally, data and analytics questions should tie everything together with predictive insights and system integration."

Each question should prompt consideration of multiple factors rather than a single answer. I will ensure they are thought-provoking by including elements like trade-offs, future scenarios, and hidden costs."
