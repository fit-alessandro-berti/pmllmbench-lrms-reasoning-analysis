The response should be structured to first analyze the current process bottlenecks, then propose specific changes to each problematic area, and finally discuss the impact on performance metrics."

    "Text": "For automation, I can suggest RPA for validation tasks and AI for feasibility analysis. For dynamic routing, a smart gateway with predictive scoring would help. The approval process can be optimized with tiered approvals and auto-approval thresholds. The key is to show how these changes interconnect rather than treating them as isolated improvements."
