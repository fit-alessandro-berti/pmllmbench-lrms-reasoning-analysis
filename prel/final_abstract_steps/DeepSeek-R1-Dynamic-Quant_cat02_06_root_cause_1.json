If theres a delay like case104 waiting 3h30m, provide alerts or prioritize tickets accordingly. 3. Analyze Level 2 Team Workload: In cases like 105 where post escalation delays are long, check if the specialized team has adequate capacity or if tickets pile up during certain times e.g., end of day. 4. Automate Hand off Processes: Use automated systems to route escalated tickets immediately and trigger alerts for Level 2 agents so they can act promptly. 5. Implement Time Tracking Between Steps: Measure the time each step takes, identify bottlenecks where delays commonly occur like between Assignment and Investigation, and address resource allocation there. 6. Batch Processing Issues: If some steps are handled in batches e.g., processing at certain times of day leading to delays, consider more real time processing. 7. Review Shift Hours or Availability: Ensure that support teams have coverage during critical hours; perhaps after escalation tickets arent processed outside business hours, causing multi day delays."
