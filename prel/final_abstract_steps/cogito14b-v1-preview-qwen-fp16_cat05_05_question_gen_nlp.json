The process involves multiple international suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, distribution across various regions, and uses digital systems and analytics."

    "Text": "First, I need to understand the key components of this supply chain: RD, sourcing from different countries with varying lead times and quality standards, assembly, logistics (air vs sea freight), inventory management strategies (JIT for high-demand markets, monthly shipments for slower ones), distribution centers worldwide, compliance issues, digital systems, data analytics, sustainability efforts."
