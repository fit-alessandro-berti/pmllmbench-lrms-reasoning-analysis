    "Text": "We are given a temporal profile model that shows average time intervals and standard deviations between activities in an insurance claim handling process. The activities are: R (Receive), A (Assign), E (Evaluate), P (Approve), N (Notify), C (Close). Anomalies we can identify: 1. R to P (Receive to Approve): Average time is about 25 hours (90000 seconds) with a standard deviation of only 1 hour (3600 seconds). This suggests a very rigid timeline for approval, which is unusual because the approval typically follows several steps (including evaluation). 2. P to N (Approve to Notify): The average time is 7 days (604800 seconds) with a standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds). This is a very long time for notification after approval and with high variability. It could indicate a backlog in the notification step or resource constraints. 3. A to C (Assign to Close): The average time is only 2 hours (7200 seconds) from Assign to Close. Typically, after assignment, there should be evaluation and approval before closing. This suggests that some claims are being closed immediately after assignment without going through the required steps, which is a process deviation. 4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify): Only 5 minutes (300 seconds) on average between evaluation and notification. This is extremely short and might indicate that the system is automatically sending a notification immediately after evaluation, which might be premature if approval is still pending."

    "Text": "Now, we generate hypotheses for these anomalies: 1. R to P (Receive to Approve) with very low STDEV: Hypothesis 1: There is an automated system that approves claims exactly 25 hours after receiving, regardless of the evaluation step. Hypothesis 2: The evaluation and approval steps are being recorded at the same time for most claims. Hypothesis 3: The data might be missing intermediate steps for these claims. 2. P to N (Approve to Notify) with long average and high STDEV: Hypothesis 1: The notification step is a manual process that is under-resourced, leading to a backlog. Hypothesis 2: There might be a requirement for a cooling-off period before notification, but sometimes it is bypassed. Hypothesis 3: The notification system may have a batch process that runs weekly. 3. A to C (Assign to Close) being too short: Hypothesis 1: Adjusters are closing claims without performing the evaluation and approval steps, possibly because the claims are deemed invalid. Hypothesis 2: The system might be closing claims automatically when an assigner marks them as no action required. 4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short: Hypothesis 1: The evaluation step is incorrectly recorded before the approval step. Hypothesis 2: The notification is automated to be sent as soon as the evaluation is done, but the approval might be happening after."

    "Text": "Now, we propose verification approaches using SQL queries on the claim_events table. For R to P (Receive to Approve) anomaly: We want to find claims where the time between R and P is between 24 and 25 hours. Also, we can check if there are claims where P occurs before E (evaluation) or immediately after assignment without evaluation. We can also check for claims that have an approval without an evaluation event."

    "Text": "However, note that the adjusters table is linked to claims via the claim_events only through the resource field (if the resource is the adjuster) but the claims table does not have an adjuster_id. We might need to join via the claim_events for the assignment event to get the adjuster. Alternatively, we can do: WITH assign_events AS ( SELECT claim_id, resource AS adjuster_id, timestamp AS a_time FROM claim_events WHERE activity = A ) SELECT a.adjuster_id, a.name, COUNT(*) AS claim_count, AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (n_time - p_time))) AS avg_delay FROM ( SELECT c.claim_id, ce_p.timestamp AS p_time, ce_n.timestamp AS n_time, ae.adjuster_id FROM claims c JOIN claim_events ce_p ON c.claim_id = ce_p.claim_id AND ce_p.activity = P JOIN claim_events ce_n ON c.claim_id = ce_n.claim_id AND ce_n.activity = N AND ce_n.timestamp > ce_p.timestamp JOIN assign_events ae ON c.claim_id = ae.claim_id ) t JOIN adjusters a ON t.adjuster_id = a.adjuster_id GROUP BY a.adjuster_id, a.name;"

    "Text": "For E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short: We look for claims where the time between E and N is less than 10 minutes (300 seconds) and check if there is an approval (P) that occurs after E but before N? If approval happens after, then it might be that the notification is premature. This query will show claims where evaluate and notify are very close and whether there was an approval in between (which would indicate that the approval was done after evaluation but before notification, so it is not premature). If has_approval_after_e_before_n is false, then the notification might have been sent before approval. We can also check the resource that is doing the evaluation and the notification to see if it is the same resource or if there is a pattern."
