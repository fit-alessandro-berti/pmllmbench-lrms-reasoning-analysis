    "Text": "We are given a temporal profile model that shows average time intervals and standard deviations between activities in an insurance claim handling process. The activities are: R (Receive), A (Assign), E (Evaluate), P (Approve), N (Notify), C (Close). The model is: ('R', 'A'): (3600, 600) # 1 hour between Receive and Assign ('R', 'E'): (86400, 28800) # 1 day between Receive and Evaluate ('R', 'P'): (90000, 3600) # ~25 hours between Receive and Approve (STDEV only 1 hour) ('A', 'C'): (7200, 3600) # 2 hours between Assign and Close ('E', 'N'): (300, 60) # 5 minutes between Evaluate and Notify ('E', 'C'): (3600, 3000) # 1 hour between Evaluate and Close (STDEV 50 minutes) ('P', 'N'): (604800, 172800) # 7 days between Approve and Notify ('N', 'C'): (1800, 300) # 30 minutes between Notify and Close Anomalies we can identify: 1. R to P (Receive to Approve): Average time is about 25 hours (90000 seconds) with a standard deviation of only 1 hour (3600 seconds). This suggests a very rigid timeline for approval, which is unusual because the approval typically follows several steps (including evaluation). It might indicate that the approval is happening without the intermediate steps, or that the steps are being recorded in a non-sequential order, or that there is an automation that approves claims at a fixed time. 2. P to N (Approve to Notify): The average time is 7 days (604800 seconds) with a standard deviation of 2 days (172800 seconds). This is a very long time for notification after approval and with high variability. It could indicate a backlog in the notification step or resource constraints. 3. A to C (Assign to Close): The average time is only 2 hours (7200 seconds) from Assign to Close. Typically, after assignment, there should be evaluation and approval before closing. This suggests that some claims are being closed immediately after assignment without going through the required steps, which is a process deviation. 4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify): Only 5 minutes (300 seconds) on average between evaluation and notification. This is extremely short and might indicate that the system is automatically sending a notification immediately after evaluation, which might be premature if approval is still pending."

    "Text": "Now, we generate hypotheses for these anomalies: 1. R to P (Receive to Approve) with very low STDEV: Hypothesis 1: There is an automated system that approves claims exactly 25 hours after receiving, regardless of the evaluation step. This might be a scheduled batch job. Hypothesis 2: The evaluation and approval steps are being recorded at the same time (or within an hour) for most claims, making the time between Receive and Approve appear consistent. Hypothesis 3: The data might be missing intermediate steps (like evaluation) for these claims, so the approval is directly recorded after assignment. 2. P to N (Approve to Notify) with long average and high STDEV: Hypothesis 1: The notification step is a manual process that is under-resourced, leading to a backlog and variable wait times. Hypothesis 2: There might be a requirement for a cooling-off period before notification, but sometimes it is bypassed, leading to variability. Hypothesis 3: The notification system may have a batch process that runs weekly, causing a fixed wait of about a week but with the possibility of early notification in some cases. 3. A to C (Assign to Close) being too short: Hypothesis 1: Adjusters are closing claims without performing the evaluation and approval steps, possibly because the claims are deemed invalid or fraudulent at assignment. Hypothesis 2: The system might be closing claims automatically when an assigner marks them as no action required without going through the full process. 4. E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short: Hypothesis 1: The evaluation step is incorrectly recorded before the approval step, so the notification is sent immediately after what is recorded as evaluation, but actually the approval happens after evaluation and then notification quickly. Hypothesis 2: The notification is automated to be sent as soon as the evaluation is done, but the approval might be happening after, which is out of order."

    "Text": "Now, we propose verification approaches using SQL queries on the claim_events table. We assume that the claim_events table has the following columns: event_id, claim_id, activity, timestamp, resource, and additional_info. We will focus on writing queries that: Identify claims with negative anomalies (i.e., time intervals that are too short or too long). Try to correlate these anomalies with adjusters, claim types, or resources. Verification Queries 1. For R to P (Receive to Approve) anomaly: We want to find claims where the time between R and P is between 24 and 25 hours (to see if its rigidly fixed). Also, we can check if there are claims where P occurs before E (evaluation) or immediately after assignment without evaluation. 2. For P to N (Approve to Notify) anomaly: We look for claims where the time between P and N is longer than 7 days (or also very short, which might indicate automation). We can also group by region or adjuster to see if the delay is associated with specific resources. 3. For A to C (Assign to Close) being too short: We look for claims where the time between A and C is less than, say, 1 hour (or even immediately) and without the required steps (E, P) in between. We can also check if these claims have a specific claim type or region. 4. For E to N (Evaluate to Notify) being too short: We look for claims where the time between E and N is less than 10 minutes (300 seconds) and check if there is an approval (P) that occurs after E but before N? If approval happens after, then it might be that the notification is premature. We can also check the resource that is doing the evaluation and the notification to see if its the same resource or if theres a pattern. These queries should help in verifying the anomalies and understanding the underlying causes."
