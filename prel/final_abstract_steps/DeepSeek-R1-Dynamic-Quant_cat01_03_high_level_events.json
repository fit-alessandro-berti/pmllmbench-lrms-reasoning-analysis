Each case starts with retrieving raw metal sheets, scanning barcodes, placing on tables... So maybe the first few steps relate to preparing materials? Like Material Preparation or Setup."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",

So maybe the first five events are Material Preparation: getting materials ready. Then Assembly starts when Operator B picks up the welding tool. Welding is part of assembly. But measuring weld integrity might be a quality step during or after assembly."

That way, each major process step has its own phase, including the relevant checks."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

  {

Material Preparation ... 2. Welding Operations ... 3. Post-Welding Processing: Quality Check and Coating 4. Final Inspection ..."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Group 1: Material Preparation Activities: Retrieve raw metal sheet Scan barcode Place on table Align with Robot Arm Preheat Rationale: These steps are all about preparing the material for assembly. Retrieving, scanning likely to track materials, placing in position, alignment ensures proper setup, and preheating readies the metal for welding. Group 2: Welding Assembly Activities: Pick up welding tool Weld corner A Weld corner B Rationale: Operator B picks up a specific tool required for welding and performs spot welds on two corners. These are direct assembly actions to join parts, so grouped as the core assembly phase. Group 3: Post-Welding Quality Check Activity: Measure weld integrity Rationale: After welding, check quality of the welds using a sensor before proceeding further. This is an immediate QC step ensuring that the assembly meets standards. Group 4: Coating & Curing Activities: Apply protective coating Dry coating Rationale: Protective coatings are applied and then dried to ensure proper adherence and finish. These steps prepare the product for final use, involving specific units Coating Unit #3, Heating Unit #2. Group 5: Final Inspection Activity: Visual check Rationale: A visual inspection by Operator C is typically a final quality control step before the product is considered complete."

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Alternative approach: After welding, applying coating could be part of Finishing steps. Then drying and checks as separate? Alternatively, considering all actions after Welding excluding QC belong to Coating & Curing with their own QCs."
