    "Text": "When writing the SQL queries I should ensure they check for out-of-sequence events missing steps and resource involvement Queries need to filter case_ids where certain events dont follow the expected order check for missing events and see if resources overlap points where steps should have been sequential Also using JOINs with resources and orders tables would add context like checking if Confirm Shipment precedes Ship Goods and creating a resource table to ensure single resource per step"
