Explanation: In the domain knowledge, for the Order-to-Cash process, after checking inventory, if sufficient, the activities should be performed in a specific order: Authorize Payment first, then Package Items, and then Ship Order. However, the process tree models these activities as parallel, allowing them to occur in any order, such as shipping the order before authorizing payment, which could lead to financial or logistical issues, like shipping without payment confirmation."
