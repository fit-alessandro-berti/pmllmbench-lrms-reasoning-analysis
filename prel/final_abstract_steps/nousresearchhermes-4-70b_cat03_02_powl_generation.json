After CS, two tasks can be done in parallel: Datacenter Allocation DA and Access Control Initialization ACI. We can model this with a partial order that has DA and ACI as nodes and no order between them. But note that both must complete before moving to the next step."

    "Text": "After DA and ACI, we have a loop: Base Network Configuration BNC then optionally if issues Debug and Reconfigure DR and then repeat the loop BNC again until stable. Interpretation: In each iteration of the loop, we do the base configuration BNC and then, if there are issues, we do a debug and reconfigure DR. Then, if the configuration is still not stable, we go back to the beginning of the loop which would be to do BNC again. The loop operator is defined as execute A, then either exit the loop, or execute B and then A again. This matches: We do A BNC and then if we exit, we are done no issues. If we dont exit meaning we have issues, then we do B DR and then we do A BNC again."

    "Text": "Steps as a sequence: Start SR CS DA and ACI in parallel loop BNC DR xor CD or MD QA and SA in parallel GLA. How to model: We can break the model into several partial orders and operator nodes. The entire process is a partial order of the following nodes: The sequence for step 1 SR CS with an edge, The parallel step 2 DA ACI with no edge between them, The loop node, The xor node, The parallel step 5 QA SA with no edge between them, The final node GLA. And then we set the order: CS must be before DA and ACI, DA and ACI must be before the loop node, loop node must be before the xor node, xor node must be before QA and SA, QA and SA must be before GLA."

    "Text": "Create the root StrictPartialOrder with the list of all nodes: SR CS DA ACI loop node xor node QA SA GLA. Then add the edges: root order add edge SR CS, CS DA, CS ACI, DA loop node, ACI loop node, loop node xor node, xor node QA, xor node SA, QA GLA, SA GLA. This means that both DA and ACI must be done before the loop node can start, and both QA and SA must be done before GLA. There is no edge between DA and ACI so they are concurrent, and no edge between QA and SA so they are concurrent. Double-check the entire flow: SR CS DA and ACI in parallel loop node xor node QA and SA in parallel GLA. This matches the scenario."
