But note: after D&R, we go back to BNC? Actually, the problem says: This (BNC followed by optional D&R) repeats until the configuration is stable. - This is a typical loop structure: we do BNC, then conditionally do D&R, and then if the condition (issues) holds, we loop back to BNC. However, note that the problem says repeats, meaning that if the loop continues, we do BNC again? But actually, the next iteration would be: after D&R we go back to BNC? That doesn't seem right."

Or do we just redo the D&R? The problem says: This (BNC followed by optional D&R) repeats until the configuration is stable. Interpretation: - In each iteration of the loop, we do the base configuration (BNC) and then, if there are issues, we do a debug and reconfigure (D&R). Then, if the configuration is still not stable, we go back to the beginning of the loop (which would be to do BNC again). Otherwise, we exit."

But in our case, we have: We want to do: BNC (A) then, if needed, do D&R (B) and then loop back to BNC (A). So the loop would be: *(BNC, D&R) ? But note: if we do D&R, then we go back to BNC, which is the next iteration. This matches: We do A (BNC) and then if we exit, we are done (no issues). If we don't exit (meaning we have issues), then we do B (D&R) and then we do A (BNC) again? But wait: after D&R we go back to A (which is BNC) to redo the base configuration? That might be the requirement."

    "Text": "How to model the entire flow? We have to create a partial order that connects the nodes in the order of the steps, but with the parallel tasks as independent. We can model the entire process as a partial order of the following nodes: ... However, the partial order in the root must set that the loop_node is after both DA and ACI? We can do: root.order.add_edge(DA, loop_node) root.order.add_edge(ACI, loop_node) This means that both DA and ACI must be done before the loop_node can start? Actually, no: the partial order condition says that if there is an edge from X to Y, then X must be done before Y. But here, we have two edges: DA->loop_node and ACI->loop_node. That means that to start the loop_node, both DA and ACI must have been completed? However, note: the partial order is a set of edges. The loop_node will start only when both DA and ACI have been completed because we have two dependencies? But wait: the loop_node is a single node. So we require that both DA and ACI are done before we start the loop_node? That is correct."

Actually, we have: root.order.add_edge(QA, GLA) and root.order.add_edge(SA, GLA) This means that GLA can only start after both QA and SA have been completed? But note: the partial order condition: if we have an edge from A to B, then A must be done before B. So for GLA, we have two predecessors: QA and SA. Therefore, GLA cannot start until both QA and SA are done? However, in the scenario, step 5 says: Once the deployment method has been chosen and completed, there are some final tasks that must happen in a partial order: ... Both QA and SA must be completed before final sign-off, so GLA must wait for both. So that is correct."

After the loop_node completes (meaning the configuration is stable), we go to the xor_node: which will execute either CD or MD.
