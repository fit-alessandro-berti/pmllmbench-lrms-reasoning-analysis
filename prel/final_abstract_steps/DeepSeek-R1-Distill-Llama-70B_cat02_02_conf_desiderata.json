The process has a strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case.

    "Text": "Moving on to Case 2. The first activity is Application Received, but the next activity is Risk Assessment without a Credit Check. That's a problem because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they do the Credit Check after Risk Assessment, which is out of order. Next, they make a Loan Decision (Rejected), but then they Finalize Documentation. The rules say that if the loan is rejected, they shouldn't finalize documentation. After that, they Close the Case. So Case 2 has two violations: doing Risk Assessment before Credit Check and finalizing documentation after a rejection."

    "Text": "Case 3 starts with Application Received, but the Credit Check happens two days later, which is beyond the recommended 24 hours (desideratum). Then Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant two days later (again, beyond the 48-hour recommendation), Finalize Documentation, and Close Case. They also didn't do a Follow-up Call, which is part of the desiderata. So, no normative violations here, just desiderata issues."

    "Text": "For Case 2, the Risk Assessment before Credit Check might have been an error or oversight. Maybe the person thought they could skip it or didn't know the rules. As for finalizing documentation after rejection, perhaps they were unaware of the rule or thought it was necessary regardless of the decision."

    "Text": "In Case 3, the delay in Credit Check could be due to high volume or system issues. The late Inform Applicant might be because the decision took time to process or communicate. Not doing a Follow-up Call might be due to resource constraints or an oversight."
