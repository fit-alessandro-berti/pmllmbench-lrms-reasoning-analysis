R to A: 1 hour avg, STDEV 10 minutes (600 sec). That seems normal unless there's a specific reason. 2. R to E: 24 hours average, 8 hours STDEV. That's a day between Receive and Evaluate on average. Maybe that's okay if evaluate takes time but the std dev is high here? Wait, 8 hours stdev from 24 would mean most are within like less than two days. Hmm, maybe not too bad."

So about 95% of cases would be between 15 and 35 hours. That suggests approvals are happening pretty strictly around an hour after receive. But in reality, you might expect more variability if there were different reasons for approval. This seems too rigid."

Example SQL using window functions and CTEs might look complex, so perhaps a common table expression that joins each activity with the next one for each claim. But given PostgreSQLs capabilities, heres an approach: For each pair (R, P), calculate the average time from receive to approval. Then select claims where this time is significantly below (or above) what the model expects. Sample query idea using window functions and CTEs: WITH OrderedEvents AS (...), RPdiffs AS (...), RPstats AS (...) SELECT ... This is getting complicated. Maybe better to compute for each R-P pair.
