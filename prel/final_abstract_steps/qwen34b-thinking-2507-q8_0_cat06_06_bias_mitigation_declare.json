Wait, looking at the given model example: it has StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo.

So perhaps the model needs to have activities that check these attributes, but the current model doesnt have them. However, the users instructions say to add constraints, not activities.

Coexistence between any decision thats biased (like Reject_Minority) and ManualReview. Wait, but in the model, activities are named like StartApplication, FinalDecision.

Lets assume that the model needs to have activities like CheckApplicantRace, ManualReview, etc., but the users example model doesnt have them. However, the instructions say to add constraints, so perhaps the activities are already in the model (but in the given example, they arent). Hmm. Wait, the problem says: the model is specified as a Python dictionary with particular keys corresponding to different DECLARE constraints. So the activities are the keys in the constraints. Wait, in the given model, the activities are the keys in the existence constraint. So to add a new constraint that involves ManualReview, I need to first add ManualReview as an activity in the model?

So add a non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and Reject. But since these activities arent in the model, Ill have to define them."
