Hmm, the given model has some existing constraints like existence, coexistence, response, etc. But the main issue is that they want to prevent discrimination based on sensitive attributes like ApplicantAge, ApplicantGender, ApplicantRace."

So, maybe adding a non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and Reject would help. But wait, the user also wants coexistence: if there's a decision for a minority, then ManualReview must coexist."

So, perhaps new activities like ManualReview are part of the process that need to be added. Wait, the original model has activities like StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo. But the user mentions sensitive attributes like ApplicantRace. So maybe the process involves activities that check these attributes. For example, CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantAge, etc."

    "Text": "So, for example, if there's an activity like CheckApplicantRace (which is a sensitive attribute check), then before a decision like Reject, there must be a ManualReview. So, possible new constraints: 1. Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject. So, add a non-succession constraint: CheckApplicantRace cannot immediately precede Reject. 2. Coexistence between any decision that's biased (like Reject_Minority) and ManualReview."

But since the problem says to add constraints, not activities, perhaps the user expects me to add constraints that reference these activities even if they aren't in the original model. But that might not be valid."

    "Text": "Let's try to add some constraints without adding new activities. For example, the existing RequestAdditionalInfo might be used as a check for sensitive attributes. But that's a stretch. Another idea: The succession constraint already exists between RequestAdditionalInfo and FinalDecision. The user wants to prevent FinalDecision from being a Reject immediately after a sensitive attribute check. So if RequestAdditionalInfo is the activity that checks sensitive attributes, but in the given model, RequestAdditionalInfo is a single activity that might be used for multiple purposes."

    "Text": "I think the safest way is to add the coexistence constraint for ManualReview and FinalDecision, and a non-succession constraint between ManualReview and FinalDecision (but that doesn't make sense). Wait, the user wants to prevent biased outcomes, so the idea is that after checking a sensitive attribute (e.g., CheckApplicantRace), you must do ManualReview before making a decision. So, new constraints: - succession: CheckApplicantRace must precede ManualReview. - succession: ManualReview must precede FinalDecision. - coexistence: ManualReview must coexist with FinalDecision (for sensitive cases). But the activities aren't in the model."
