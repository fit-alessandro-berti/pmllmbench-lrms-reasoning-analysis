    "Text": "So, the plan is: 1. Assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This will help in checking the sequence of activities. 2. Use window functions to look for the next two activities in the sequence to ensure they follow immediately after the first activity in the sequence. 3. Calculate the time difference between the Create Order and Confirm Order events for the identified sequences. 4. Mark the cases that meet both conditions (sequence and timing) and then exclude all their events from the final result."

    "Text": "Wait, but how do I ensure that the three activities are consecutive? Lets think. For each occurrence of Approve Purchase Requisition, I need to check if the next activity (by timestamp) is Create Order, and the one after that is Confirm Order. So, using the row_number partitioned by case_id and ordered by timestamp, I can check the next two rows. Alternatively, using the LEAD window function. For each row, check the next two activities. If the current activity is Approve Purchase Requisition, the next (LEAD 1) should be Create Order, and the next after that (LEAD 2) should be Confirm Order. That way, the three form a consecutive sequence. But wait, what if there are other activities in between? For example, if after Approve Purchase Requisition theres another activity before Create Order? Then the LEAD approach would not catch that. So, the LEAD function would check the next two rows in order, which are the immediate next events. So, if the three activities are consecutive, their row numbers would be consecutive. So, the LEAD approach should work here."

    "Text": "Wait, but in the ordered_events CTE, do we need the ROW_NUMBER? Because in the LEAD function, the order is determined by the PARTITION and ORDER BY. So, even without the ROW_NUMBER, the LEAD functions would work as they are ordered by timestamp. So, perhaps the ordered_events CTE can be simplified."

    "Text": "But lets test for possible edge cases. For example, a case that has the sequence but the time difference is exactly 5 days. Then, its not included in problem_sequences, so the case is not excluded. Thats correct. Another edge case: a case has the correct sequence, but between Create Order and Confirm Order theres another event. But in our approach, since were checking the next two activities after Approve, if theres an event in between, the next_act1 would not be Create Order, so the sequence wouldnt be detected. So, thats correct because the problem requires the three activities to be in direct succession. What if a case has the sequence but the Confirm event is not the third in the sequence? For example, Approve followed by Create followed by another event, then Confirm. Then, the LEAD(2) would not capture it. So, the sequence is not detected. Correct."
