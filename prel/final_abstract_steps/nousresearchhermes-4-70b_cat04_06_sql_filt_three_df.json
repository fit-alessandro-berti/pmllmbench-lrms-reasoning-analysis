    "Text": "First, I need to identify the cases that have the exact sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' in immediate succession. That means no other events from the same case can be between these three. So, for each case, I need to check the order of activities and ensure that these three appear consecutively in that exact order. Next, among those cases, I need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' in that sequence is more than 5 days. If both the sequence and timing conditions are met, the case should be excluded from the final result."

    "Text": "So, the plan is: 1. Assign a row number to each event within a case, ordered by timestamp. This will help in checking the sequence of activities. 2. Use window functions to look for the next two activities in the sequence to ensure they follow immediately after the first activity in the sequence. 3. Calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events for the identified sequences. 4. Mark the cases that meet both conditions (sequence and timing) and then exclude all their events from the final result."

    "Text": "Alternatively, using the LEAD window function. For each row, check the next two activities. If the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next (LEAD 1) should be 'Create Order', and the next after that (LEAD 2) should be 'Confirm Order'. That way, the three form a consecutive sequence."

    "Text": "But wait, what if there are other activities in between? For example, if after 'Approve Purchase Requisition' there's another activity before 'Create Order'? Then the LEAD approach would not catch that. So, the LEAD function would check the next two rows in order, which are the immediate next events. So, if the three activities are consecutive, their row numbers would be consecutive. So, the LEAD approach should work here."

    "Text": "Putting it all together: First, create a CTE that identifies the sequences and checks the time difference. Then, collect the case_ids from there. Then, in the main query, select all events where the case_id is not in that list. So, the SQL query would look something like: WITH ordered_events AS (...), problem_sequences AS (...) SELECT el.* FROM event_log el WHERE NOT EXISTS (...)"

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in the ordered_events CTE, do we need the ROW_NUMBER? Because in the LEAD function, the order is determined by the PARTITION and ORDER BY. So, even without the ROW_NUMBER, the LEAD functions would work as they are ordered by timestamp. So, perhaps the ROW_NUMBER is not necessary. Let me check. The ordered_events CTE includes ROW_NUMBER() but in the with_leads CTE, we use LEAD functions. However, the ROW_NUMBER is not used in the with_leads. So, perhaps the ordered_events CTE can be simplified."

    "Text": "Testing for possible issues: - What if a case has the sequence but the time difference is not more than 5 days? Then, it's not in problem_sequences, so the case is included. Correct. - What if a case has the sequence but the 'Confirm' event is not the third in the sequence? For example, 'Approve' followed by 'Create' followed by another event, then 'Confirm'. Then, the LEAD(2) would not capture it. So, the sequence is not detected. Correct."
