Process Steps: Supplier Selection (SS): Choosing the supplier from whom components will be procured. Order Placement (OP): Placing the order for the required components. Receive Components (RC): Receiving the ordered components at the warehouse. Quality Inspection (QI): Inspecting the received components for quality. Component Assembly (CA): Assembling the components into a sub-unit of the product. Product Testing (PT): Testing the final assembled products functionality. Packaging (PK): Packaging the final product for shipment. Warehouse Storage (WS): Storing the packaged product in the warehouse until shipping. Distribution (DT): Shipping the product to retailers or customers. After-Sales Support (AS): Providing support and maintenance after the sale. Definition of Temporal Profile: A dictionary where keys are pairs of activities (tuples) and values are (average_time, standard_deviation). Scope: Include pairs of activities that eventually follow each other in the process, not just directly consecutive ones. Constraint: The LLM must estimate these times (no specific data provided). The dictionary should include a representative subset ensuring complexity (non-consecutive pairs included)."

Self-Correction on ZETA: The prompt defines ZETA but does not ask me to calculate deviations based on ZETA. It asks me to provide the dictionary containing AVG and STDEV. I do not need to write code to check for deviations just the profile itself. Check Scope: Representative subset ensuring complexity. I have 10 activities. There are 10*9/2 = 45 possible ordered pairs in a linear flow. I dont need all 45 but a good sample. Ill aim for about 12-15 pairs.
