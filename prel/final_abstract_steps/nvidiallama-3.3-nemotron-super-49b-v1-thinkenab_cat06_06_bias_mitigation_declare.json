    "Text": "The instructions mention three types of new constraints: Coexistence, Response/Succession, and Non-succession. Let's think about each. For Coexistence: If a decision for a sensitive applicant (like Approve_Minority or Reject_Minority) happens, there must be a ManualReview. So, any decision activity thats variant of a sensitive group should coexist with ManualReview. But how are these activities named? Maybe the decision activities are named with suffixes indicating the sensitive attribute, e.g., Reject_Minority. So, I need to add coexistence constraints where these decision activities must have a ManualReview in the same trace."

    "Text": "For Response/Succession: Activities that disclose sensitive attributes (like CheckApplicantRace) should not directly lead to decisions without a BiasMitigationCheck. So, for example, after CheckApplicantRace, there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before a decision. This could be a response constraint where CheckApplicantRace must be responded by BiasMitigationCheck, and then that check must precede the decision. Alternatively, a succession constraint ensuring that CheckApplicantRace is followed by the check before the decision. Wait, but the problem says cannot immediately follow, so maybe using a response or succession constraint to enforce an intermediary step."

    "Text": "Now, looking at the given model, there are activities like RequestAdditionalInfo leading to FinalDecision. But the sensitive attributes and their checks arent in the original model. So I need to introduce new activities related to sensitive attributes and the mitigations. Let me outline possible new activities: - Sensitive attribute checks: CheckApplicantRace, CheckApplicantGender, CheckApplicantAge - Bias mitigation activities: BiasMitigationCheck - ManualReview - Decision activities with sensitive variants: Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority, etc. (Assuming that the decisions are tagged with the sensitive attribute they pertain to.)"

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "But the problem states that the process might be susceptible to bias based on sensitive attributes. So the original models FinalDecision might not have these variants. So perhaps the new constraints need to target any decision that involves a sensitive attribute. Alternatively, maybe the decisions are generic, but the process must ensure that when a sensitive attribute is considered, certain checks are in place. Wait, the problem says: ensure that the sequence of activities does not discriminate based on these attributes. So the constraints should prevent sequences where a sensitive attribute check directly influences a decision without mitigation."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, first, I need to add constraints that: 1. When a decision (like Approve or Reject) is made for a sensitive applicant, there must be a ManualReview coexisting in the trace. So coexistence between, say, Reject_Minority and ManualReview. 2. After checking a sensitive attribute (e.g., CheckApplicantRace), there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before making a decision. So CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck, which then leads to the decision. Alternatively, using a chain response or succession. 3. Prevent a direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject (non-succession constraint)."
