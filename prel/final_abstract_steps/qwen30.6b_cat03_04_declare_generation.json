The DECLARE model has specific keys, and each keys value is a dictionary with activities and their support and confidence values. First, I need to map each activity from the given scenario to the appropriate keys. Let me start by listing all the activities mentioned: Idea Generation (IG), Design Draft (DD), Technical Feasibility Check (TFC), Cost Evaluation (CE), Prototype Creation (PC), Laboratory Testing (LT), User Testing (UT), Approval Gate (AG), Marketing Plan (MP), and Final Launch (FL)."
