So that's an X operator between CE and FBP, with CE having the condition for cardiovascular and FBP the other. Wait, but how do I represent conditions in pm4py? Maybe I need to use the label of each process tree node to denote the condition, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, maybe the operator X itself implies the exclusive choice without needing additional conditions. Hmm."
