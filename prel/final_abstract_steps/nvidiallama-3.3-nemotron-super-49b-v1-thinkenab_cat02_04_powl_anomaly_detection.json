    "Text": "Second the LOOP on Approve and Issue Invoice A LOOP in POWL means that the children can be executed multiple times possibly with a loop back So after approving and issuing an invoice the process could loop back to repeat Approve and Issue Invoice again Normally once an order is approved the invoice is issued once and then payment is awaited Repeated approvals and invoices might indicate errors like incorrect invoicing or inefficiency leading to multiple invoices for the same order which could confuse the customer or cause financial issues"
