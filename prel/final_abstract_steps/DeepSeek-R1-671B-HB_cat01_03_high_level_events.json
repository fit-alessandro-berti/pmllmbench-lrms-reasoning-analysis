    "Text": "Looking at Case A1 and B2, the events start with retrieving a raw metal sheet, scanning the barcode, placing it on a table, aligning, and preheating. These all seem like initial setup steps. Maybe the first high-level step is Material Preparation since they involve getting the raw material ready for processing. The same sequence is present in both cases, so that's consistent."

    "Text": "Next, after preheating, there's picking up a welding tool, welding corners A and B. Those actions are performed by Operator B, which might indicate a shift to assembly. Welding is part of putting the product together, so this could be grouped under an Assembly phase. The use of a specific tool and the same operator makes sense here."

    "Text": "Following welding, there's a measurement of weld integrity by a quality sensor. That sounds like a quality check specific to the welding step. Then applying a protective coating and drying it. This could be part of a finishing or coating process. Finally, a visual check by Operator C. The quality checks after each major step might be grouped into a Quality Inspection phase, but in the sample, the weld measurement and coating application are separate."

    "Text": "Looking at the sequence: Retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat → Material Preparation. Pick up tool, weld corners → Assembly. Measure weld integrity → Quality check for welding. Apply coating, dry → Coating Process. Visual check → Final inspection. These seem logical and sequential."

    "Text": "Alternatively, perhaps after Assembly, applying coating and drying are part of a Finishing step, and then the visual check is part of Quality Inspection. But in the sample, the weld check is right after welding, then coating, then drying, then another check. So maybe the steps are: Material Preparation, Welding Process (including the welding and the integrity check), Coating Process (apply coating, dry), Final Inspection (visual check)."

    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "If I grouped all quality checks into one single step (including weld integrity and visual checks), this would aggregate non-consecutive events, which might not be temporally close. So it may be better to keep the weld check part of the welding phase and the visual check as part of Final Inspection."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Thus, the proposed groupings are: Material Preparation: Retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat. Welding & Welding Quality Check: Pick tool, weld A/B, measure integrity. Coating & Curing: Apply coating, dry. Final Quality Inspection: Visual check. Each group represents a distinct phase in the process, with each phase consisting of related activities."
