    "Text": "Looking at the sample, the steps that involve quality checks are measuring weld integrity and visual check. These could be two separate quality steps, but grouping them together under Quality Inspection might make sense. However, they are separated by other steps (coating and drying). So if we group all quality checks into a single high-level step, the timestamp would have non-consecutive events. But high-level steps can consist of non-consecutive events. Wait, but probably the groupings should be based on temporal proximity and logical sequence. So, maybe each quality check is part of the preceding step. For example:\n\n- After welding, check the weld (part of welding step).\n\n- After coating and drying, check the overall product (part of final inspection step).\n\nAlternatively, having separate quality steps. But the user instruction says to group into coherent stages, so probably the checks are part of their respective process steps. However, typically, quality checks can be their own phase. So perhaps:\n\n1. Material Preparation\n\n2. Welding Assembly\n\n3. Protective Coating\n\n4. Drying\n\n5. Quality Inspections (including both weld check and visual)\n\nBut that may split steps too much. Alternatively, Quality Inspections could include both checks.

Alternatively, Welding and its check could be two groups, but in practice, the check is part of the welding phase. Let's check the timestamps in case A1:\n\nWelding steps occur at 08:01:00 (pick up tool), 08:01:05 (weld A), 08:01:10 (weld B). Then at 08:01:20, measure weld. Then coating at 08:01:30. So the time between welding and coating is 10 seconds. The time between welding steps and the check is 10 seconds. So they are temporally close. But between the weld check and coating is 10 seconds (08:01:20 to 08:01:30). So the check is right after welding. So grouping welding and check into one step is reasonable."

Alternatively, visual check could be part of Quality, but in this case, the check is after coating. So maybe:\n\nHigh-level steps:\n\n1.

However, if grouping all quality checks into a single high-level step would require aggregating non-consecutive events, which might not be temporally close.

This includes getting the metal sheet, scanning for tracking, positioning, and preheating.

Ensuring the welds are secure before moving on.\n\nProtective Coating & Curing: Applying a protective layer and drying it. This is a finishing step to protect the product.\n\nFinal Quality Inspection: A last check to ensure the product meets visual standards before completion.\n\nWait, but in the sample log, Case A1's events after Welding Integrity Check are:\n\nApply coating, dry, then visual check. So in Coating & Curing group, we have apply and dry. Then the visual check is a separate step. But is the visual check part of the coating process? No, it's the final check. So grouping as Final Quality Inspection makes sense. However, in the sample, there's only the visual check here. But perhaps in a larger log, there might be more steps. In this subset, it's just the visual check. But the name could be Final Quality Inspection. Alternatively, maybe the Final Quality Inspection includes other checks beyond visual, but in the sample, it's just the visual. Let's think. The problem says the sample is a subset but the full log is large. The instruction says to use this subset to infer rules. So based on this sample, the visual check is the last step, so it's the Final Quality Inspection."
