    "Text": "So, the answer is that the model allows a trace where the order is canceled and then received again, which is impossible because the process ends after canceling. Therefore, such a trace is: 1. Receive Order 2. Check Inventory 3. Cancel Order 4. Close Order 5. Receive Order 6. Check Inventory 7. Cancel Order 8. Close Order But in reality, after step 4, the process ends, so step 5 can't happen. Therefore, this trace is invalid, but the model allows it. So, that's the specific trace that the model permits but shouldn't, because it's logically impossible."
