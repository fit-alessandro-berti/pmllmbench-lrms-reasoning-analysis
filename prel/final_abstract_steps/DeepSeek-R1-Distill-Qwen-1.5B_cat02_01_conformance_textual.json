Wait, after Authorize payment, it cancels instead of proceeding to Package items. According to the norm, after authorizing payment, the next step should be Package items, not Cancel. So this case violates the norm because it cancels before Package items are done."

    "Text": "But wait, in Case 3, after Authorize, it cancels instead of Package. That's also wrong because after Authorize, you should go to Package, not Cancel. So Cases 3, 4, and 5 all have violations because they skip Authorize and go to Cancel."

So they're wrong because the norm says you should go to Authorize before Package. \n - Case 3: After Authorize, instead of Package, they cancel. So that's also wrong because the norm says Package should come after Authorize. \n So all three cases (3, 4, 5) violate the norm, whereas Cases 1 and 2 follow the norm correctly."
