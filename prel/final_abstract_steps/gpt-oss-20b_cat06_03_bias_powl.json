In particular, focus on the XOR operator that chooses between checking local affiliation (D) and skipping that step. Can you identify how this branching introduces subtle bias favoring certain applicants? Discuss the implications of giving a non-legally protected group an incremental advantage and how it might impact fairness and equity in the final loan decisions."

    "Text": "We need to discuss bias introduced by XOR branch: if applicant is local resident/member of known community group, they get a subtle score uplift; otherwise skip. This gives advantage to those who are part of that group, which may be correlated with race/ethnicity or other protected characteristics. Even if not legally protected, it can still create disparate impact."
