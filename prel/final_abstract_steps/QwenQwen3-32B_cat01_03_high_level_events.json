So maybe the steps are: Material Preparation (1-5) Structural Welding (6-8) Weld Integrity Check (9) Protective Coating Application and Drying (10-11) Final Visual Inspection (12) That seems logical. Each group has a clear purpose."

For example, steps 1-5 are done by Operator A and Robot Arm, then Operator B does welding, then Quality Sensor, then Coating Unit, then Operator C. So each group is handled by different resources, which might indicate different process steps."

    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Let me check if theres any overlap or if some steps could be merged. The welding and integrity check are separate because the integrity check is a quality assurance step. The coating and drying are two steps but part of the same process. The final visual check is a separate QA step, possibly to catch any issues after coating."
