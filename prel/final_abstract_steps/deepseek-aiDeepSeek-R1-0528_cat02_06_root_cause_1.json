    "Text": "Now, let's see which cases are significantly above the average (e.g., above 1.5 * 1224 = 1836 minutes). Case 101: 135 < 1836 -> not long Case 102: 1510 < 1836 -> not long (but note: 1510 is above average but below 1.5x average? Actually 1.5*1224=1836, so 1510<1836 -> not flagged as significantly longer) Case 103: 80 -> not Case 104: 1450 < 1836 -> not Case 105: 2945 > 1836 -> significantly longer. However, note that the problem says significantly longer than average. We might also consider cases that are above average and also have a substantial absolute delay? But let's stick to the threshold. Alternatively, we might note that cases 102, 104, and 105 are all above average (1224 minutes) but only case 105 exceeds 1.5x. However, let's also note that cases 102 and 104 are both above 24 hours (which is a full day) and case 105 is over 2 days. So we might want to consider cases 102, 104, and 105 as having longer resolution times. But the problem says significantly longer. We can set a threshold arbitrarily. Let's use: Threshold = average + 1 standard deviation? But we don't have that many data points. Alternatively, we can see the median? But we have only 5 cases. Since the average is 1224 minutes, and cases 101 and 103 are very short (135 and 80 minutes), while 102, 104, and 105 are long, we can consider 102, 104, and 105 as the ones that are significantly longer."

Now, only case 105 (2945 minutes) is above 2281.3. Alternatively, we can use a simpler approach: since the two short cases are under 150 minutes and the three long ones are over 24 hours, we can consider the three long ones (102, 104, 105) as significantly longer. Given the context, I think its safe to say cases 102, 104, and 105 are the ones that take significantly longer."

    "Text": "Step 2: Determine potential root causes. Let's look at the event sequences for cases 102, 104, and 105. Case 102: Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:05 Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:30 (25 minutes after receive) Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00 (30 minutes after triage) Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 11:30 (2.5 hours after assignment? But note: assignment at 09:00, escalate at 11:30 -> 2.5 hours) Then, Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 14:00 (2.5 hours after escalation? 11:30 to 14:00 is 2.5 hours) Then, Resolve Ticket: next day at 09:00 (about 19 hours after investigation? 2024-03-01 14:00 to 2024-03-02 09:00 is 19 hours) Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 09:15 Observations: - There is a long gap between escalation and investigation (2.5 hours) but that is within the same day. - The major delay is between investigation and resolution: 19 hours (overnight). This suggests that after the Level-2 agent investigated, the resolution did not happen until the next morning. Case 104: Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:20 Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 09:00 (40 minutes) Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:30 (30 minutes after triage) Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 13:00 (3.5 hours after assignment) Resolve Ticket: next day at 08:00 (19 hours after investigation? 2024-03-01 13:00 to 2024-03-02 08:00 is 19 hours) Close Ticket: 2024-03-02 08:30 Observations: - There is a delay of 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation (by Level-1 agent). This might be a waiting time. - Then, after investigation, the resolution happens the next day (19 hours gap). This is similar to case 102. Case 105: Receive Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:25 Triage Ticket: 2024-03-01 08:35 (10 minutes) Assign to Level-1 Agent: 2024-03-01 09:00 (25 minutes) Investigate Issue: 2024-03-01 09:10 (10 minutes after assignment) Escalate to Level-2 Agent: 2024-03-01 10:00 (50 minutes after investigation by Level-1) Then, Investigate Issue (by Level-2?): 2024-03-02 14:00 (next day, about 28 hours after escalation) Resolve Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:00 (19 hours after the Level-2 investigation? 2024-03-02 14:00 to 2024-03-03 09:00 is 19 hours) Close Ticket: 2024-03-03 09:30 Observations: - After escalation, there is a very long gap (28 hours) until the Level-2 agent investigates. - Then, after investigation by Level-2, there is a 19-hour gap until resolution."

    "Text": "Common patterns: - Cases 102 and 104 both have a 19-hour gap between the last investigation and resolution. This gap spans overnight and suggests that the resolution step is being done the next business day. - Case 105 has a long gap (28 hours) after escalation and before the Level-2 investigation, which also spans overnight and then some. Additionally, note that escalations occur in cases 102 and 105, but not in 104. However, case 104 also had a long resolution time. In case 104, there was no escalation, but there was a 3.5-hour gap between assignment and investigation by Level-1, and then a 19-hour gap from investigation to resolution. The 19-hour gap in cases 102, 104, and 105 (after investigation) is very consistent and points to a shift change or non-working hours. Also, in case 105, the gap after escalation (28 hours) is even longer."

    "Text": "Potential root causes: 1. Escalations: - When a ticket is escalated (as in 102 and 105), there might be a delay in the Level-2 team picking it up. In case 105, the Level-2 investigation didnt start until the next day at 14:00 (over 28 hours after escalation). This indicates that the Level-2 team might be overloaded or the ticket is not being handled promptly after escalation. 2. Long waiting times between activities: - In case 104, 3.5 hours between assignment and investigation by Level-1. - In case 102, 2.5 hours between escalation and investigation by Level-2? Actually, escalation at 11:30 and investigation at 14:00 (same day) is 2.5 hours, which is within a shift. 3. Overnight delays: - The 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution in cases 102, 104, and 105 suggests that the resolution step is not happening until the next business day. This might be because: a. The agent who investigated the issue does not resolve it immediately, and it gets postponed. b. The resolution step requires approval or input that is not available until the next day. c. The support team does not work 24/7, so if the investigation finishes late in the day, the resolution is done the next morning. - Similarly, in case 105, the escalation happened at 10:00 on day1, and then the Level-2 investigation didnt start until 14:00 the next day (which is a gap that includes a full night and part of the next day). 4. Also note that in case 102, the Level-1 agent worked on the ticket for 2.5 hours (from 09:00 to 11:30) before escalating. This might be acceptable if the issue is complex, but it also contributes to the total time."

    "Text": "Step 3: Insights and Recommendations. Insights: - The most significant delays occur when a ticket is not resolved on the same day it was investigated. This is seen in all three long cases (102, 104, 105) with a 19-hour gap between investigation and resolution. - Escalations introduce additional delays, especially in the handover to Level-2 (as seen in case 105 with 28 hours between escalation and Level-2 investigation). - There might be inefficiencies in the handover process between shifts or between teams. Recommendations: 1. To address the overnight delay between investigation and resolution: - Implement a policy that requires agents to resolve the ticket on the same day if the investigation is completed by a certain time (e.g., 2 hours before the end of the shift). - If the investigation is completed near the end of the shift, hand over the ticket to the next shift for resolution. 2. For escalations: - Improve the escalation process to ensure that Level-2 agents are promptly notified and assigned tickets. Consider setting service level agreements (SLAs) for escalation response time. - Monitor the workload of Level-2 agents to avoid bottlenecks. 3. Reduce waiting times between activities: - For Level-1 agents, ensure that assigned tickets are picked up promptly. Consider real-time alerts for new assignments. - Analyze why there is a 3.5-hour gap in case 104 between assignment and investigation. It could be due to agent workload or prioritization. 4. Consider extending support coverage to avoid overnight delays, or implement a follow-the-sun model if the business requires 24/7 support. 5. Additionally, for tickets that require escalation, Level-1 agents should be trained to escalate faster if they identify that the issue is beyond their capability, to avoid spending too much time before escalation. Overall, the main bottleneck appears to be the resolution step happening the next day after investigation, and the delay in handling escalated tickets. We also note that the triage and assignment steps are relatively quick (within an hour) in most cases. Therefore, focusing on the investigation-to-resolution phase and the escalation process would yield the most improvement."
