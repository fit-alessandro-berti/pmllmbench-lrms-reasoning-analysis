Maybe priority orders have different rules, but according to the assumed process, even priority should follow steps?

Looking at the provided data for case 1003: In the third table section for case 1003: Activities are: 15: Register Order 16: Perform Credit Check 17: Ship Goods (missing Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment before this) Then 18: Issue Invoice, 19: Confirm Shipment (after shipment), and 20: Payment.
