    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the normative process and the requirements. The strict rules outline a sequence for processing a loan application: Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant [Finalize Doc if Approved] Close Case. There are specific ordering rules, like Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment, and Finalize Documentation can only happen if approved and before closing. Also, skipping steps, reversing order, or finalizing docs after a rejection are not allowed. Then there are the desiderata: recommendations like completing Credit Check within 24 hours, informing within 48 hours of the loan decision, and a follow-up call before closing. These are best practices but not strict rules."

    "Text": "Looking at the event logs for cases 1, 2, and 3. Starting with Case 1: All steps are in order, including Finalize Documentation after approval and closing. The timestamps show Step 1: 9:30 after 09:00 (within 24h), Step 2: 10 hours after 09:30 (which is 11:00, same day). Step 4: Loan Decision. Step 5: Inform Applicant at 13:00, three hours after. The criteria is within 48 hours of loan decision, which is ok. The follow-up call is missing, but that's a desideratum. So Case 1 is good for normative but missing the follow-up."

    "Text": "Case 2: Here, Risk Assessment happens before Credit Check. That's a no-no. Then after rejection, Finalize Documentation is done before closing. Also not allowed. So Case 2 violates both normative rules."

    "Text": "Case 3: Credit Check happens 24 hours after Application Received (Received 09:00, Credit Check at 10:00 same day? Wait, timestamp is 2024-01-14 10:00, which is 24h later. Wait, Application was on 2024-01-12 09:00, so 24h later would be 09:00 on 2024-01-13. Wait, the timestamp for Credit Check is 2024-01-14 10:00. Wait, 14th is two days later. Wait, maybe a miscalculation. Wait, the normative rule doesn't mention timing as a strict rule. The normative is about the order. The time for Credit Check is a desideratum, not normative. Wait, the problem says Desiderata are recommended timing, like Credit Check within 24h. But the Normative is only the order. Wait, looking back: Identifying Cases That Fail the Normative Rules No, the normative timing is not enforced. The step to check process time for Credit Check is a desideratum. Wait, the problem states that the mandates are strict with ordering, but the timing is part of desiderata. Wait, the key constraints in Normative Process Behavior specify the sequence but not time windows. The timing is part of the best practices. So in Case 3, the Credit Check happens 48h after Application Received, which violates desideratum but not normative."

    "Text": "Similarly, Inform Applicant is at 15:00 on 16th, which is within 48h. Wait, 12:00 (decision) to 15:00 (inform) same day is within 48h. Wait, maybe a miscalculation. From 14th 12:00 to 16th 15:00 is two full days plus 3 hours, which is under 48h (48h is two days). Wait, 14th 12:00 + 48h is 16th 12:00. So 15:00 is within. So Case 3's time violations are to desiderata. So the normative rules are satisfied."

    "Text": "Case 2 has two normative violations: wrong order and Finalize after rejection. Case 1 and 3 have desideratum deviations but not normative. Case 1 had a follow-up call missing. Case 3 same. So summarizing: Normative violations: Case 2. Two violations. Desideratum failures: Case 1 (follow-up call missing), Case 3 (Credit Check 24h late and Inform after 48h might be edge but within, but wait, the Inform Applicant is at 15:00 on 16th, which is within 48h, but the time since decision is from 14th 12:00. So Inform is at 15:00 on 16th. 48h is 48 hours, which is 2 days. So 12:00 on 14th + 48h = 12:00 on 16th. So Inform at 15:00 is within 48h. But the Credit Check was started on 12th, done on 14th. That's 48 hours. The desideratum is within 24 hours, so 48 is too late. Therefore Case 3's Credit Check is a partial time failure. Inform is ok. Also, the follow-up call isn't there, but that's another absence. Therefore, the answer should list Case 1 and 3 for desideratum, Case 2 for normative. Also, for Case 2's undesideratum: the Finalize after rejection is bad. The other half is the wrong order and missing Credit Check. So the answer should break it down."
