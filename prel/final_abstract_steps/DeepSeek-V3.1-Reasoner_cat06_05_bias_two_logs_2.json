    "Text": "The key is to identify the bias mechanism first - the +5 adjustment for the club affiliation in Group B. Need to break down why this is problematic: it creates unequal treatment, introduces non-job-relevant factors, and disproportionately impacts the protected group (non-locals who cant join the club)."
