    "Text": "Now lets think about incorporating predictive analytics and dynamic resource allocation Predictive Analytics We could analyze past requests to predict which new requests are likely to be custom This could help in routing requests more efficiently from the start Dynamic Resource Allocation Instead of fixed paths we could have a more flexible flow where resources are allocated based on current load and priority For example if the system is busy with standard requests custom requests might get more resources Automation Tasks like validation feasibility analysis and quotation preparation could be partially or fully automated using AI and rules engines"
