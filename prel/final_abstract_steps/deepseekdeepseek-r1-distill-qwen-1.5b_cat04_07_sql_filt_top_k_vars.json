    "Text": "First, the task is to construct a SQL query for DuckDB. The goal is to determine the sequence of activities for each case_id. So, I think I need to group the events by case_id and then order each group by timestamp. DuckDB's window functions might be useful here. I can use the window function with order by timestamp to get the sorted order of activities."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next, I need to group cases by their complete activity sequence. That means for each sequence, I have to count how many times each unique sequence appears. This sounds like a SQL COUNT on the activity sequence. So, I should create a temporary table or use a subquery to capture each unique activity sequence and its count."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then, the third part is to count how many cases correspond to each variant. This is straightforward—group the cases by their activity sequence and count the number of cases per sequence. This will give the frequency of each variant."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Finally, I need to determine the top K variants based on their frequency. I'll sort these variants in descending order of frequency. Once I have the top K, I need to return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. This requires joining the original data with the resulting counts and filtering based on the variant's inclusion in the top K."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "I should also make sure that the queries are efficient and don't cause any performance issues. DuckDB is optimized for such operations, but I need to be cautious about the data size and how I structure the queries."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let me outline the steps: 1. For each case_id, sort the activities by timestamp to get the sequence. 2. Group cases by their activity sequences and count occurrences. 3. Group the cases by their activity sequences and count the cases per variant. 4. Sort the variants by frequency in descending order."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "I think I can use window functions to get the activity sequence for each case. Then, use COUNT on the sequence to group them. For filtering, I'll join the data with the results of step 4 and apply an ON clause to include only cases that are part of the top K variants."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "I should also consider if there are any edge cases, like varying case_id values or activity types. But for now, the SQL structure should handle these as long as the queries are correctly scoped."
