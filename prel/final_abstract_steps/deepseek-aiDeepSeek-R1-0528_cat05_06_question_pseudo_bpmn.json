    "Text": "Let's break down the process and think about areas that might be interesting to probe: 1. Start Event: What triggers the process? Is it a new product launch, a new sales cycle, or something else? 2. Market Research: How is this conducted? What factors are considered? How does it influence the design? 3. R&D - Design Prototype: How are design decisions made? How do they account for component availability? 4. Parallel Gateway (split) for Securing Components: Why are these specific countries chosen? What are the risks of multi-sourcing? 5. Securing Components: How are suppliers selected? What are the criteria? How are contracts managed? 6. Parallel Gateway (join): How is synchronization handled? What if one component is delayed? 7. Shipping to Malaysia: Why Malaysia? What are the logistics considerations? 8. Assembly: How is the 24/7 operation managed? What about labor conditions? 9. Quality Checks: What are the pass/fail criteria? How is rework managed? How does it impact the schedule? 10. Pack & Label: How is packaging designed? What about environmental considerations? 11. Parallel Gateway (split) for Shipping Methods: How is the decision made between air and sea? What are the cost and time trade-offs? 12. Customs Clearance: How are regulatory differences handled across countries? What about tariffs? 13. Regional Distribution Centers: How are locations chosen? How is inventory allocated? 14. Parallel Gateway (split) for Distribution: How are the different distribution channels managed? How are conflicts resolved? 15. Parallel Gateway (join): How is completion of all distribution channels tracked? 16. Monitor Inventory & Sales Forecast: What tools and methods are used? How frequently? 17. Exclusive Gateway (Adjust Orders vs. Proceed): What triggers an adjustment? How are suppliers informed? 18. End Event: What are the success metrics for the entire process?"

Example of open-ended: How might the company adapt if one of the key component suppliers faces a disruption? Avoid yes/no questions. We'll aim for 20 questions covering various aspects.
