    "Text": "First, it is apparent that different cases have wide-ranging total resolution times. Cases with escalations (e.g., Case 102 and Case 105) show noticeably long total resolution times. Second, overnight periods appear as significant contributors to delays when activities are not completed on the same day."

    "Text": "Using the timestamps of each activity in the event log, the total resolution time for each case is calculated as the difference between the first event (Receive Ticket) and the last event (Close Ticket). This allows identification of significantly longer cases."

    "Text": "To determine whether any cases qualify as 'significantly longer,' the mean and standard deviation of total resolution times across all cases are calculated. Cases exceeding the threshold of the mean plus one standard deviation are flagged."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Further analysis of flagged cases reveals key contributors to delays. For example, Case 105 exhibits the longest resolution time due to a 28-hour delay between escalation and investigation, and an additional 19-hour gap during overnight periods."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Potential root causes of delays are inferred: escalations might introduce waiting time due to Level-2 agent availability or workload, and overnight gaps indicate a lack of round-the-clock operations."

    "Text": "Proposed improvements are validated against the event patterns. For example, if escalations to Level-2 agents could be addressed promptly or eliminated through better Level-1 training, cases like 102 and 105 could avoid long delays."
