So if merged?\nAlternatively, since the problem says that events from logs A and B may have differing event names but could represent same occurrence.\nWait in this case:\nLog A has \"Payment Processed\" (event_type) at 10:02:00Z\nLog B has \"PaymentCheck\" at 00205. So different event types, with timestamps five seconds apart (five is over the two-second tolerance). Hence not merged; they're separate events."

Merged events have combined attributes; unmerged retain their own, with indication of origin.\nThus the chronological list would be as follows:\n1. 2023-10-10T09:59:58Z - Order Received/OrderReceived merged\n2. 2023-10-10T10:01:29Z - Order Validated/Validation merged\n3. 2023-10-10T10:02:00Z - Payment Processed (Log A)\n4. 2023-10-10T10:02:05Z - PaymentCheck (Log B)\n5. 2023-10-10T10:03:00Z - Quality Check (Log B)\n6. 2023-10-10T10:05:02Z - Shipping/Item Shipped merged\n7. 2023-10)10T1020 Item Delivered from Log A."
