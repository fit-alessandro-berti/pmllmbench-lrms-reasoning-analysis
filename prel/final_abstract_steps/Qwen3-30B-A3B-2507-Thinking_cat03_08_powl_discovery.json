So A is the first part, B is the part that leads back. So in this case, A would be TST, and B would be RT? Wait, no.

But in Case 3, it's AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS. So there's an extra IQC. Hmm. Maybe the log is misread. Let's check the timestamps for Case 3: Case 3: After AS (10:00), IQC (10:15), IQC (10:30), AS (10:45), IQC (11:00), AS (11:15), TST (11:45). So between AS (10:00) and the next AS (10:45), there are two IQC's. Then between AS (10:45) and AS (11:15), there's one IQC. So it's like AS -> IQC -> IQC -> AS -> IQC -> AS. So the number of IQC's is one more than the number of AS's after the initial AS. So after initial AS, they have two IQC's, then AS, then one IQC, then AS. This suggests that the loop is * (IQC, AS), but I'm not sure."

The loop * (TST, RT) would mean: execute TST (A), then either exit or execute RT (B) and then TST (A) again. So the sequence is TST -> (RT -> TST)*. In Case 1: TST -> RT -> TST -> PK. So TST (A) -> RT (B) -> TST (A) -> exit. This matches the loop * (TST, RT). In Case 3: TST -> RT -> TST -> PK. Same as Case 1. In Case 5: TST -> RT -> TST -> RT -> TST -> PK. So TST -> RT -> TST -> RT -> TST -> exit. This is two loops: TST (A) -> RT (B) -> TST (A) -> RT (B) -> TST (A) -> exit. Which matches * (TST, RT). So the loop for the testing phase is clearly * (TST, RT)."
