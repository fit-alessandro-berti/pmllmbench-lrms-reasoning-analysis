Wait, no, in the code, model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Decide) and model1.order.add_edge(Screen, Interview). Hmm, so after screening, both the hiring decision and conducting interviews are directly after screening? That can't be right. Normally, you screen candidates, then conduct interviews, then make a decision. So in Model 1, the order between Interview and Decide is messed up.
