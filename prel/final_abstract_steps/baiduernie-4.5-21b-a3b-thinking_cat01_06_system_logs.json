However, the log doesnt explicitly have a session ID. Observation: The log shows events that are interleaved between applications. We need to form cases that are coherent units of work.

But note: the same window title might appear in two different sessions? We can assign the same case ID for both sessions? But that would mix two different work sessions on the same document? Or we can consider each session as a separate case? The problem says a logical unit of user work. The two sessions on Document1.docx are separated by other activities. So we can form two cases for Document1.docx? Or we can consider the entire work on Document1.docx as one case? But the user took a break (went to email and then to PDF and then to Excel) and then came back? So it might be two separate efforts?

But note: the same window title might be reused? We see the same window title in two sessions? We can use the window title and the application to form a unique key? But the problem says case ID should be unique per case? So we can use a unique number per case? And we can name the case by the window title? And we assume that the same window title in two different sessions is the same window? Even if there is a long gap? That is a common scenario in document editing. So I decide: Case ID: a unique number (starting from 1) and we can name the case by the window title? But we have two different documents with the same name? We see two Word windows: Document1.docx and Quarterly_Report.docx? And then a PDF? So we have three distinct windows? Actually, we see: Word: Document1.docx (first session) and then later Document1.docx (second session) -> same case? Word: Quarterly_Report.docx (first session) and then later Quarterly_Report.docx (second session) -> same case? Adobe Acrobat: Report_Draft.pdf -> one case Microsoft Excel: Budget_2024.xlsx -> one case Microsoft Word: two sessions for Document1.docx and one session for Quarterly_Report.docx? Actually, we see: Case1: Document1.docx (events from 2024-12-11T09:00:00 to 2024-12-11T09:06:00) and then the user reopens Document1.docx at 09:07:00? Actually, the event at 09:07:00 is a focus on Quarterly_Report.docx? Then at 09:07:45, the user starts typing in Quarterly_Report.docx? So thats a new case for Quarterly_Report.docx? Then the user works on it until 09:08:15? Then closes? Then the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx again? Actually, we dont see that? We see the user focus on Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:00 and then at 09:08:15, the user closes the document? Then the log ends? And for Document1.docx: the first session ends with the switch to Excel? Then the second session for Document1.docx starts with a switch from Excel to Document1.docx? Then the user types and saves? Then at 09:07:00, the user focuses on Quarterly_Report.docx? So we have two cases for Document1.docx? Actually, we see two distinct sessions for Document1.docx? But the same window title? So we can assign the same case ID? But that would be two sessions? We can either: Option A: Merge the two sessions for Document1.docx into one case? But they are separated by other cases? Option B: Split into two cases: one for each session? The problem says: a logical unit of user work. The two sessions on Document1.docx might be considered as one case? Because its the same document? But the user took a break and worked on other things? In process mining, we often have continuity. I think the best is to create one case per window per day? But we dont have the day? Given the time, I propose to create a case for each distinct event sequence that forms a coherent work period? But without clear boundaries, its hard. Alternative approach: We can create a case per application? But that would break the document narrative."

And then the activities are the events that happened in that window? Even if there is a long gap? This is the approach taken in many process mining logs. So we will have: Case1: Window=Document1.docx (in Microsoft Word) -> events: 2024-12-11T09:00:00.000Z,FOCUS,App=Microsoft Word,Window=Document1.docx ... typing events for Document1.docx 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Word,FromWindow=Document1.docx,ToApp=Google Chrome,ToWindow=Email - Inbox Then later, when the user comes back to Document1.docx, we create a new case? Or reuse the same case ID? We see: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z,SWITCH,FromApp=Microsoft Excel,FromWindow=Budget_2024.xlsx,ToApp=Microsoft Word,ToWindow=Document1.docx -> This is a switch to Document1.docx? But note: the previous session of Document1.docx was already closed? Or it was still open? We dont know. But the window title is the same? So we reuse the case? But the event at 09:06:00 is a switch from Excel to Document1.docx? This suggests that the window Document1.docx was already open? Or it was reopened? We cannot tell. I will reuse the same case ID for the same window title? So Case1: Document1.docx covers both the first and the second session? And the events are in chronological order? But then the events are not in the same case? They are interleaved with other cases? In process mining, we create a case per instance, and the instance is identified by the document and the session? But we dont have session information. Given the above, I will create one case per distinct window (application and window title) and assign a unique case ID. The activities are the events that occurred in that window, regardless of when they occurred. This means that the first session of Document1.docx and the second session are in the same case? But then the events from the first session of Document1.docx and the second session are not in chronological order in the case? They are mixed with events from other applications? This is not desirable because the event log should be in chronological order? But process mining logs are usually stored in chronological order per case? So we will have one case with multiple events in chronological order? But the events in the case are not contiguous in time? They are sorted by time? But the case will have events from different times? That is acceptable in process mining? Yes, process mining logs often have events from different times for the same case. Therefore, I will form a case for each unique (application, window) pair. The case ID will be a unique number (e.g., based on the window title and application) but we can simply assign an incrementing ID."

For example: FOCUS -> Editing Document TYPING -> Editing Document SAVE -> Saving SWITCH -> Switching Application CLICK -> Clicking SCROLL -> Scrolling HIGHLIGHT -> Highlighting But we need to be consistent. We can define: FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLICK (when in the context of the document or email) -> Editing SAVE -> Saving SWITCH -> Switching Application CLICK (on an email) -> Reading Email or Replying to Email SCROLL -> Scrolling in Email HIGHLIGHT -> Highlighting in PDF So we will create activity names that are: Editing: for FOCUS, TYPING in a document or email?

That is not an activity by itself? We can omit SWITCH because its a transition. Also, the CLOSE event? We can create an activity for Closing Application. But the problem says: Each event in the final log should correspond to a meaningful activity. The SWITCH event is just a transition between applications and doesnt represent an activity? So we can skip it? Or we can create an activity for switching? But that would be very short. Alternatively, we can include the SWITCH in the activity name? For example: SWITCH from AppA to AppB -> Switching to Application B But the problem says meaningful, so we can do that. However, the user also has activities in between? Like opening an email? So the SWITCH event alone might not be meaningful? But it is part of the workflow. Given the above, I will include the SWITCH event in the activity name? But then we have: Event: SWITCH, ... -> Switching to Google Chrome But note: the log provides the FromApp and ToApp, so we can use that in the activity name. Proposed activity naming: FOCUS -> Editing [Window] TYPING -> Editing [Window] SAVE -> Saving [Window] SWITCH -> Switching to [ToApp] CLICK -> Clicking on [Action] SCROLL -> Scrolling in [App] HIGHLIGHT -> Highlighting text in [App] But we want generic activity names? The problem says standardized activity names. So we can drop the window title? Or keep it as part of the case name? The case name is already the window title? So in the activity name, we can omit the window title? We can do: Editing Document Editing Spreadsheet Editing PDF Switching to [ToApp] Clicking on [Action] Scrolling in [App] Highlighting text in [App] But then we lose the context of the document? But the case name is the window title? So the analyst is familiar with the context. Alternatively, we can include the window title in the activity name? But that might be redundant? I think its better to omit because the case name is already the window title? And the activity name is the type of action."

We also see a SWITCH event: Timestamp: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z Action: SWITCH App: Microsoft Excel Window: Budget_2024.xlsx FromApp: Microsoft Excel FromWindow: Budget_2024.xlsx ToApp: Microsoft Word ToWindow: Document1.docx Activity: Switching to Microsoft Word But note: the event has the action type SWITCH, and we have the FromApp, ToApp. We will derive the activity name from the action type and the relevant attributes (app, window) but without being too verbose. Proposed activity names: FOCUS, TYPING: Editing SAVE: Saving CLICK: Clicking [but we have an Action in the event? So we can include the action in the activity name? For email, we have specific actions: Opening, Replying, etc.] SCROLL: Scrolling HIGHLIGHT: Highlighting SWITCH: Switching to {ToApp} But note: the event for CLICK also has the window title? But we are not including it in the activity name? We can if we want? But the problem says standardized activities? So we want consistent names? So maybe not. Alternatively, we can be more context-aware by including the application in the activity name? For example, for Chrome email: Email: Opening and for Word: Email: Clicking in the email list? But that is not standardized. Given the trade-off, I will use: For CLICK events in the email application (Google Chrome) and when the Action is about email, use: Opening Email, Replying to Email, etc. For other CLICK events, use Clicking. But then the activity names are not standardized? We can do: Always use the specific action when available? But for a Word document, we only have Clicking and we dont know what the click was for? So we use Clicking. We can also create a category for email and for document? But then we lose the specific action. I think its better to have standardized names without specific context? But then we lose information. Given the instructions: standardized activities rather than keeping the raw action verbs, we should avoid specific actions like Opening Email because that is application-specific? Instead, we can use: Interacting with email for any click in the email list or on an email header? But we dont have that information. Given the above, I will use Clicking for all CLICK events and hope that the event log analysis can infer the context. But that is not very helpful for analysis. Alternatively, we can include the window title or application in the activity name? But the problem does not require it? And it would not be standardized. I think the best is to use the following compromise: For CLICK events in the email application (Google Chrome) and when the Action is about email, use: Email Interaction For other CLICK events, use Clicking But then Email Interaction is not very specific. Given the instructions and the time, I will proceed to assign activity names as follows: FOCUS: Editing TYPING: Editing SAVE: Saving CLICK: If the event has an Action and the Action starts with Open, Reply, or Send, then use that action as the activity name. Otherwise, Clicking SCROLL: Scrolling HIGHLIGHT: Highlighting SWITCH: Switching And then in the explanation, we can describe the activity names."

    "Text": "Now, lets build the event log. We will create a table with columns: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp. How to number the cases? We will create a case per (app, window) pair. We can use the window title and app as a key? But we need a unique ID. We can assign an integer ID per case. Steps: Create a set of unique (app, window) pairs from the log. Assign an ID to each pair (e.g., starting from 1). For each event, determine the case ID by the (app, window) of the event. Then, assign the activity name based on the action type and attributes. Unique (app, window) pairs in the log: 1. (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) 2. (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) [first session] 3. (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) [second session] -> but same as above? We are not creating separate cases? We are using the same case ID for both sessions? Yes, because the window title and app are the same? But wait, the two sessions are separated? We will have two sets of events for the same case? That is acceptable? Yes, because the case represents the document, and the events are in chronological order within the case. But note: the first event for (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) is at 08:59:50, then the next event for this case is at 09:07:00? Then the events in between are for other cases? That is fine. However, we see only one (Microsoft Word, Quarterly_Report.docx) case? And two (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) cases? But the two (Microsoft Word, Document1.docx) events are not consecutive in time? We will put them in the same case? Or separate cases? We are using the (app, window) pair as the key. The two sessions of Document1.docx have the same key? So they are the same case? Then the events for the first session and the second session are in the same case? But they are not contiguous in the log? That is acceptable in process mining? Yes, the event log can have events from the same case interleaved with other cases. But in the log, between the first session of Document1.docx and the second session, there are events for other cases (Chrome email, Acrobat, Excel). Then the second session of Document1.docx appears. So in the event log for the case Document1.docx, the events will be: Event1: first session events (09:00:00 to 09:06:00) Event2: events from other cases that happened in between? No, we are grouping by case, so the event log for Document1.docx will have all events that occurred in that window, regardless of when they occurred? But then the events are out of order? This is a problem: the event log should be in chronological order? But if we group by case, the events for a case are not contiguous? And we want to preserve the time order? Therefore, we must not group events by case arbitrarily. We must preserve the time order. The standard in process mining is to have the event log in chronological order, and each event belongs to a case. So we cannot put all events of the same case together? We must sort by timestamp and assign each event to its case. The approach is: For each event, determine its case ID (by (app, window)). Then, in the event log, sort by timestamp (and then by case ID within the same timestamp? but timestamp may not be unique)."

The activity names provide a higher-level view and can be used to filter and aggregate events. Coherent Narrative: The user started by editing a document titled Document1.docx. They saved their work and then switched to an email client to handle some emails. In the email, they opened a specific email, replied, typed some messages, and then sent it. After that, they switched to read a PDF and highlighted some text. Then, they opened an Excel file to work on some budget information, saved it, and then switched back to Word to work on the first document (Document1.docx) again, followed by the other document (Quarterly_Report.docx). Finally, they closed the second session of Document1.docx. This narrative shows the users work in multiple applications and documents in a logical sequence."
