So for the supply chain process, all ordered pairs (X,Y) where X occurs before Y in at least one execution. Since the process has a typical sequence, but there might be variations. However, the problem says \"eventually follow each other in at least one process execution\", so even if in some path X comes before Y, even if in another path Y comes before X, but as long as there's at least one where X is before Y, then (X,Y) is a key."

So the main path is SS first, then OP, then RC, etc. So any pair (X,Y) where X is earlier in the list than Y would be part of the temporal profile.

The average would be (SS-OP avg) + (OP-RC avg). The standard deviation would be sqrt( (sd1)^2 + (sd2)^2 ), assuming independence. But maybe the problem expects simpler estimates, perhaps just taking the sum of averages and sum of stds? Or maybe just approximate. Alternatively, perhaps for the purpose of this problem, the standard deviation can be similar to adjacent steps, but maybe scaled. Alternatively, just assign the standard deviation as a fixed value for each pair, but that might not be accurate. Since the problem says \"estimate\", perhaps the exact calculation isn't needed, just plausible numbers."
