    "Text": "Okay, so I need to come up with 20 open-ended questions based on that supply chain description. Let me start by understanding the process thoroughly. The supply chain involves R&D, multiple international suppliers, assembly in Malaysia, distribution through various transport methods, and distribution to different regions. There are complexities like lead times, quality control, logistics coordination, compliance, and strategies for inventory management."
