Succession between CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck: After checking the race of the applicant, the process must immediately proceed to a bias-mitigation step.

Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision: Ensures that a decision (FinalDecision) cannot directly follow the race check without passing through the bias-mitigation step.\n\nThis way, sensitive attribute checks are followed by additional steps to mitigate bias, and decisions are always accompanied by manual review."
