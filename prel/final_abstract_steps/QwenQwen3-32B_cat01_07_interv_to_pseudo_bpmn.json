    "Text": "Starting with Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk. She describes the process from receiving an invoice via email. The first step is checking if its associated with a valid purchase order number. If it doesnt have a PO, I send it back to the supplier requesting more details. If it has a PO, I log it into our accounting system. After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. If everything matches, I then send it to the department manager for approval. If theres a discrepancylike incorrect pricing or missing itemsI email the purchasing team to clarify. Sometimes, if the discrepancy cant be resolved easily, I have to escalate it to my supervisor. Once all issues are resolved and the manager approves, I schedule it for payment. Thats basically the flow."

    "Text": "Dan, the Purchasing Officer, receives the invoice from AP. He checks if the invoice details line up with what we ordered. I open up the PO and compare quantities, prices, and any delivery charges. If somethings offlike if we were billed for extra unitswe either contact the supplier directly or ask the Accounts Payable clerk to hold the invoice until the supplier sends a corrected version. If everything is correct, I send a confirmation email back to Accounts Payable. Sometimes, if the PO number is missing, I tell Mary she needs to get that information before I can proceed. We never approve anything without a confirmed PO reference. Once I confirm, I assume Mary or her team moves it to the manager for final approval. After approval, I think it goes to Accounts Payable for scheduling the payment run."
