Wait, but in a partial order, if there's no edge between two nodes, their order isn't enforced. Wait, the model1's order is a DAG where edges represent precedence.

Wait, the loop operator in POWL is defined as *(A, B) meaning execute A, then either exit loop or execute B followed by A again. So here, loop_onboarding is [Onboard, skip]. So the loop would be Onboard followed by a choice of skipping or doing the silent transition. Wait, maybe the loop operator here allows the repetition of Onboard. Let me think: the loop operator has two children. The first is the body and the second is the exit. So *(A, B) means do A, then either exit (B) or do A again.

So the loop would execute Onboard, then either exit the loop (i.e., do B=skip and exit), or do B (which is skip) and then Onboard again. So this effectively allows repeating Onboard multiple times. So you can do Onboard once, or Onboard, skip, Onboard again, etc. But since B is a silent transition (skip), the loop allows repeating the Onboard activity multiple times. That's an anomaly because onboarding should be done once. Repeating onboarding doesn't make sense. So the loop here allows looping back to onboard again, which is incorrect."
