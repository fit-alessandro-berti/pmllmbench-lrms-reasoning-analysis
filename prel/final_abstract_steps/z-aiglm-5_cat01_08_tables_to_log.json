If multiple timestamps exist (e.g., multiple items picked at different times), I should produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate. Usually, in process mining, granularity matters. If items are picked at different times by different people, separate events are better to see the flow. Example Order 1001: ITEM-001 picked 10:15, ITEM-002 picked 11:00. Different pickers. It makes sense to list them as separate events Item Picked or Line Item Picked to show the duration or specific resources involved. Let's stick to individual line item events for Item Picked as they have distinct timestamps and resources."

Step 2: Process Order Lines Table Activity: Item Picked Timestamp: item_picking_date Resource: picker_id (Lookup name). Observation: Order 1004 has no delivery or invoice. Orders: 1001,1002,1003,1004,1005. Order Lines all covered. Deliveries: 1001,1002,1003,1005. Order 1004 missing. Invoices:1001,1002,1003,1005. Order 1004 missing. Payments linked correctly. So, Order 1004 stops after picking. Order 1005 is paid. Step 3: Process Delivery Table Activity: Order Dispatched Timestamp: delivery_dispatch_date. Activity: Order Arrived Timestamp: delivery_arrival_date. Note: Order 1002 has two deliveries (split shipment). Step 4: Process Invoice Table Activity: Invoice Issued. Step 5: Process Payments Table Activity: Payment Received."

Payment Resource: Since no human actor is listed for payments, I will assign the payment_method to the Resource column or denote it as System. Missing Data: Order 1004 has no subsequent events after picking. Ordering: Strict chronological order based on timestamp. One final check on Resources Table: Looks good. Final check on Columns requested: Resource/Actor optional but recommended. One detail: Order 1002 Delivery Dispatch 2 (Jan 5) is before Delivery Arrival 1 (Jan 7). Chronological sorting for 1002 preserved."
