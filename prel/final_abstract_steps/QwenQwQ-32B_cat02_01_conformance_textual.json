    "Text": "Case 3 Path is Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close Wait after Cancel Order they still did Ship Order Thats against the rule because after canceling fulfillment steps like Ship shouldnt be done So this is a violation Also the Authorization after Check is okay but the next action was Cancel Once an order is canceled you cant do Ship So shipping after cancellation is wrong Thats two violations here both Cancel followed by Ship and the fact that they did Ship after Cancel So Case 3 is definitely bad Also the order form goes to close after that But even so the Ship is the main issue here"

    "Name": "Validation - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the Case 3 actually has more than one violation First they did Authorize Payment even when inventory was insufficient leading to Cancel later and then they did Ship after Cancel Therefore if the path went into Cancel that implies that the Authorization shouldnt have happened before the Cancel Thus Case3 has two violations 1 doing Auth after Check but before Cancel when there was insufficient and 2 then proceeding to Ship after Cancel So two violations here"
