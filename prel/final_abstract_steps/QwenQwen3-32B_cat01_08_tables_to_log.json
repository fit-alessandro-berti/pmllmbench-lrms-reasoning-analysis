    "Text": "Next, the Order Lines table. Each order can have multiple items. The item_picking_date is the timestamp for the Items Picked activity. Since an order might have multiple items picked at different times, I should create a separate event for each items picking. However, if the picking dates are the same, maybe combine them. But looking at the data, for order 1001, two items were picked at different times. So each will be a separate event. The resource is the picker_id, which can be mapped to the resource_name from the Resources table."

Since an order can have multiple deliveries, each delivery is a separate case? Wait, no, the case is still the order_id. So each delivery is part of the same case. So for order 1002, there are two deliveries, so two dispatch events and two arrived events. Need to check the timestamps to ensure the order is correct."

So each payment is a separate event linked to the invoice, which in turn is linked to the order."
