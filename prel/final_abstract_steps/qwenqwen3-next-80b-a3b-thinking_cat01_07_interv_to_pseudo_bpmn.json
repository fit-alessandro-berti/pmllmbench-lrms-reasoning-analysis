    "Text": "Starting with Mary, the Accounts Payable Clerk. She says when an invoice arrives (usually by email), she checks for a valid PO number. If no PO, sends back to supplier. If PO exists, logs into accounting system, then forwards to Purchasing to confirm receipt. Then matches invoice line items against PO. If matches, sends to department manager for approval. If discrepancies, emails Purchasing to clarify; if unresolved, escalates to supervisor. After manager approves, schedules payment. Dan, Purchasing Officer: When he gets the invoice from AP, he checks against PO. If issues, contacts supplier or asks AP to hold. If correct, confirms to AP. Carlos, Department Manager: Gets notified after PO match and Purchasing confirmation. Approves if all good. Rita, AP Supervisor: Handles exceptions. If Mary cant resolve, escalates to her. Karen, Supplier Relationship Manager: Involved when theres discrepancies."

    "Text": "If no PO, send back to supplier. Then maybe a loop? But Mary says send it back to supplier requesting more details, so after that, maybe the supplier sends a new invoice with PO, then it goes back to start? Or does the process wait for the new invoice? But the interviews don't specify what happens after sending back. So perhaps after sending back, the invoice is on hold until supplier responds. But the model needs to capture that. ... For simplicity, perhaps the Send Back to Supplier task leads to a Wait for Supplier Response task, then back to Check PO."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Then Mary, after getting confirmation, matches line items against PO. Wait, but if Dan already checked that, why does Mary do it again? Maybe Dan checks for receipt, and Mary checks the line items. But that seems redundant. Alternatively, maybe Dan's check is about whether the goods were received, and Mary's matching is checking the invoice details against PO. But Mary says: Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system. So the confirmation from Purchasing is that the goods were received, then Mary does the line item matching. But Dan's statement says he compares quantities and prices. This is a bit conflicting. Let's try to reconcile."

    "Text": "This is a bit of a conflict. To proceed, I'll note that there might be some overlap, but based on Mary's statement, the steps are: - After Purchasing confirms receipt, Mary matches line items against PO. But Dan says his job is to check invoice details against PO. So perhaps the confirmation from Purchasing includes checking the PO details. So Mary's matching step is redundant, but per her account, she does it. So the model should include it."

Forward to Purchasing Department (Dan) for confirmation. 5. Purchasing checks invoice against PO (quantities, prices, etc.) and confirms receipt. 6. Mary matches invoice line items against PO. 7. Department Manager (Carlos) receives notification, reviews invoice. 8. After approval: Schedule Payment. 9. For exceptions (e.g., missing PO, discrepancies): Now, gateways: Also, roles: Artifacts: Exceptions:"
