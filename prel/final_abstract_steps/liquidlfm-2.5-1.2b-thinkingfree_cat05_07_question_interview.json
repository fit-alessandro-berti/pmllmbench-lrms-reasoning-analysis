    "Text": "Hmm maybe some of these can be refined Maybe number 5 is better as How are exceptions such as special insurance or custom clauses managed in the process Alternatively What safeguards are in place to ensure all unique property requirements are properly accommodated during onboarding Another angle responsibility distribution Like Who oversees the execution of each step in the onboarding process Or maybe How is the timeline structured for property activation to ensure smooth user onboarding Wait the user wants to uncover missing details decision making criteria roles timing exceptions So ensuring the questions hit those points without being too direct Also need to make sure theyre all open ended"
