The root is a Sequence: [Receive_Order, Check_Inventory, XOR_node, Close_Order] The XOR_node has two branches: - Successful subtree (PARALLEL): [Authorize_Payment, Package_Items, Ship_Order] - Cancel subtree (SEQUENCE): [Cancel_Order, Close_Order] Wait, that's interesting. The XOR node is after Check_Inventory and before Close_Order, but Close_Order is also in the root sequence after the XOR. That means Close_Order appears twice in the model: once as part of the cancel branch and once as the final step in the root sequence."

Then XOR: either go to successful subtree OR cancel subtree - Successful subtree: all three activities (Authorize, Package, Ship) in parallel (so order doesn't matter) - Cancel subtree: Cancel_Order then Close_Order 4. Then, after the XOR, Close_Order again (from root sequence) So the model has Close_Order appearing twice: once as part of the cancel branch, and once as the final step. That's a red flag."

    "Text": "Now, what sequences would this allow? Since the XOR node is followed by Close_Order in the root, the model requires Close_Order to happen after the XOR branch, regardless of which branch was taken. But in the cancel branch, Close_Order is already included in the cancel_subtree. So if the cancel branch is taken, we'd have: - ... -> Cancel_Order -> Close_Order (from cancel_subtree) -> then Close_Order again (from root sequence) That would mean Close_Order happens twice. But in reality, Close_Order should only happen once at the end."

So the sequence is: R, C, Ca, Cl, Cl. And the model allows this because it's structured that way."
