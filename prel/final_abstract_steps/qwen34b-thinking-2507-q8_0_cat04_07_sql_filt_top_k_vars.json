So, the task is to create a DuckDB query that does several things: first, for each case_id, get the ordered sequence of activities based on timestamp. Then group those sequences to find unique process variants, count how many cases per variant, get the top K variants, and finally return all events from cases that are in those top K variants."

Wait, but the problem says the sequence is determined by sorting events within the case by timestamp. So for each case_id, we need to order the activities by timestamp."
