Verify Documents becomes Physical ID Verification\n\n3. Call Customer context: customer stepped out, so officer calls to have them return. Since this is the only Call in this case, it can stay as \"Call Customer\" unless we need to make it more specific. But since it's not duplicated in the case, maybe leave as is. Alternatively, maybe the problem expects that even if it's a single instance but with a unique context, but the problem's instruction is to focus on duplicates. So perhaps leave it as \"Call Customer\".\n\nWait the problem says \"rename the activities so that their names clearly reflect their contextual differences\". So even if an activity occurs once but in a context that's different from other instances of the same activity name in other cases, perhaps they should be renamed. Hmm, the problem's first instruction is to \"identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case\" so the renaming is required for those. For activities that are not duplicated in the same case but have different contexts across cases, maybe they don't need renaming unless the name is ambiguous. For example, \"Call Customer\" in C001 is to request missing docs, in C002 first is to clarify discrepancy, second to confirm, and in C003 to get the customer back. All these are different contexts but since they are not in the same case, perhaps the original name is okay. The problem might not require renaming those unless they are in the same case.
