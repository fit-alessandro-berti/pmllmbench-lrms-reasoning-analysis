    "Text": "Let me think of the typical loan process. Usually, you start by receiving the application. Then you check the applicants creditworthiness (preliminary credit check). After that, you might need more documents, so gathering those comes next. Once all docs are in, you assemble the offer. Then theres a quality check to make sure everythings compliant and meets standards. Then you authorize the terms. Only after that can funds be transferred. Also, you have to notify the customer at some point, maybe after the offer is assembled or authorized."

    "Text": "Looking at the constraints, exactly_one on Preliminary_Credit_Check means only one of those activities happens, which makes sense because you cant do that step multiple times. The precedence and succession constraints enforce ordering. For example, Quality_Assurance_Review must come before Authorize_Contract_Terms."

That doesnt make sense in the process flow. Maybe I got it backwards? Maybe the target is the prerequisite. This part is confusing. Maybe I should focus on the precedence and succession constraints first."

    "Text": "The responded_existence for Assemble has target QA Review. So the Assemble activity can only occur if QA Review has been done. That implies that you cant assemble the offer until after QA has reviewed it. So the sequence would be: After receiving and credit check and gathering docs, you assemble the offer package, but you cant do that until QA is done."
