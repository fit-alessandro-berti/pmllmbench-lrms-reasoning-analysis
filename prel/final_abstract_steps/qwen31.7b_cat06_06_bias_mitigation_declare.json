    "Text": "But this is not a valid constraint. The non-succession constraint is supposed to prevent the two activities from being in succession. ... This is getting complicated.

I think the key is to add the coexistence constraints for the sensitive decisions, and then add the succession and non-succession constraints that require the BiasMitigationCheck between the relevant pairs."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, the final answer would include these constraints in the declare_model. Also, the rationale would explain that these constraints ensure that manual reviews are present when decisions are made for sensitive applicants, and that the BiasMitigationCheck is in between sensitive checks and decisions to prevent bias."
