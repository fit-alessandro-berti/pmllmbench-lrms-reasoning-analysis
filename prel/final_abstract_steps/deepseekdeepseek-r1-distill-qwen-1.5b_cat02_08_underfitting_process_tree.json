The model is said to be underfitting, meaning it doesnt capture all necessary constraints to prevent logically incorrect behaviors. Looking at the process tree model, its structured as a sequence of sub-process trees. The root is a process tree with children: Receive_order, Check_inventory, xor_node, close_order. The xor_node is an XOR operator connecting two sub-trees: successful_subtree and cancel_subtree."

That makes sense because if inventory is sufficient, all those actions should happen in parallel. The cancel_subtree is a sequence of cancel_order and close_order, which probably represents the process of canceling the order and closing it. The root is a sequence of these four processes. The XOR operator typically means that either one of the child process trees must be executed, but not both.
