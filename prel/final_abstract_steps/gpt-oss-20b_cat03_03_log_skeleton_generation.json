But we can set equivalence between Receive Order and Invoice Customer? Might be too strong. Better: maybe Generate Shipping Label (GSL) and Dispatch (D) are equivalent? Actually dispatch only after shipping label; but they might both occur exactly once each case. So equivalence could be between GSL and D."

Usually invoice is generated after order is shipped or at receipt time. Let's say invoice occurs after dispatch (or at same time). Also RP should occur after IC (payment recorded after invoicing). So we can set always_before pairs accordingly."

Payment may be partial multiple times until full payment recorded - let's keep simple as either one payment record per case so set to either one occurrence only once when paid fully else zero if no payment yet?"

That seems reversed relative typical precedence relation used earlier they defined Always Before meaning If A occurs then B should have been executed previously => B precedes A . So it's like B < A . For our chain where earlier tasks precede later tasks this matches typical precedence direction reversed relative naming confusion they call it Always Before meaning B comes before A . Eg If I want ensure that CI comes after CO I'd put (CI,CO) meaning CI requires CO previously executed . Good mapping accordingly."
