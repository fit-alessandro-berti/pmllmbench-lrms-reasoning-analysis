    "Text": "The model is a Python dictionary with various keys like 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', etc., each mapping to activities with support, confidence, and sometimes a target. The activities have real-life meanings listed, so I should connect those to the model's structure."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Existence probably means the activity must happen, since support and confidence are 1.0. For example, Receive_Application and Gather_Additional_Documents are mandatory. The absence part has Proceed_Without_Compliance, which is prohibited, so that's a constraint to prevent non-compliance."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The name suggests that this check must occur exactly once. The model's entry here with support and confidence 1.0 would enforce that this step is done once and only once. That's important to avoid redundant checks, saving time and resources, and maintaining consistency."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at 'init', which starts with Receive_Application. That's the first step, so the process begins here. Then 'responded_existence' leads to Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package with a target of Quality_Assurance_Review. So after assembling the package, the next step is QA review. That ensures that the offer is properly vetted before moving forward."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Precedence has Quality_Assurance_Review leading to Authorize_Contract_Terms. So QA must come before authorization. Similarly, succession has Preliminary_Credit_Check leading to Gather_Additional_Documents, so the credit check must precede gathering docs. These enforce the sequence, preventing steps from happening out of order."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The 'altresponse' and 'altprecedence' might be alternative paths, but since their support and confidence are 1.0, maybe they are required in certain branches. For instance, Transfer_Funds leads to Notify_Customer, which is logical because you can't notify before transferring?"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, the key 'noncoexistence' has Transfer_Funds with target Receive_Application. That might be a loop, but maybe that's a way to enforce that you can't do Transfer_Funds without first receiving the application. But since support and confidence are 1.0, perhaps that's a mandatory check to ensure that the application was received before proceeding to transfer funds."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The business goals here likely include compliance with regulations (like anti-money laundering, consumer protection laws), ensuring due diligence in credit checks, preventing fraud by requiring proper documentation, maintaining audit trails through QA reviews, and ensuring that processes are followed step-by-step to avoid errors."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Constraints like exactly one credit check prevent over-verification, which could be costly or invasive. The precedence rules ensure that each step logically follows the prior, maintaining workflow integrity. The absence of Proceed_Without_Compliance being prohibited enforces that all compliance steps are mandatory."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Starting with Receive_Application (init), then response leads to Preliminary_Credit_Check (exactly one), then succession takes it to Gather_Additional_Documents. Then maybe coexistence would require Gather_Docs to then go to Authorize_Contract_Terms via the coexistence target. Then precedence takes QA review to Authorize, then chainresponse might lead to Transfer_Funds, which then notifies."

  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Potential issues: If any step is missing, the model's support=1.0 would require it, so the system would block proceeding. The targets ensure the next step is known, maintaining the process structure."
