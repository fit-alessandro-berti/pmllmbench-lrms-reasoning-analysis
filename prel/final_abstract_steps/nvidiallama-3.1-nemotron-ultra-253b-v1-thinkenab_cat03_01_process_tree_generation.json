The loop operator * in the process tree requires that after executing A (which is the loop body), you can either exit or execute B and then A again. Wait, the loop syntax is * (A, B), which means A is executed, then either exit or do B and loop back. So how does this apply here?"

Wait, maybe the loop is optional. But in process trees, the * operator requires the loop body to be executed at least once. So this is a problem because according to the scenario, the loop is only entered if the initial test results are abnormal."
