    "Text": "The event log reveals a repeating pattern where 'Request Missing Info (RMI)' is frequently followed by a 'Validate Form (VF)' before returning to the main flow. Additionally, the activities can be grouped into clear phases: reception of application, validating and assessing eligibility, optional repetition for missing information, and final approval and archival."

    "Text": "The hypothesis of a loop for 'RMI' and 'VF' was validated by reviewing case 3, where 'RMI' and 'VF' were repeated before proceeding to 'Approval Decision (AD)'. The sequence and loop structure seemed consistent across all cases in the log."
