    "Text": "Moving on to Case 1002 The activities here are Create Requisition Issue PO without approval first Then later Approve Requisition Receive Goods Invoice Received Release Payment before approving the requisition and before matching the invoice Then after payment they do some steps like Receive Goods again Wait looking back the log shows 1 Create Purchase Requisition 2 Issue Purchase Order 3 Vendor Invoice Received 4 Release Payment 5 Approve Purchase Requisition after payment was released 6 Receive Goods 7 Match Invoice to PO 8 Close Case Oh this is a problem The Purchase Order was issued before the requisition was approved Thats a big nono Normally you need the requisition approved first before issuing the PO Also they released payment before even approving the requisition and before matching the invoice Releasing payment before matching the invoice and without proper approvals can lead to paying without verifying the goods or invoice details which is risky Also the approval step was delayed until after the payment was released Thats definitely an anomaly"

    "Text": "Case 1003s activities Create Requisition Approve it Issue PO Then Release Payment before receiving the invoice and goods Wait let me check again Wait the steps here are 1 Create Requisition 2 Approve Requisition 3 Issue PO 4 Release Payment this is next 5 Then later Vendor Invoice Received and Receive Goods Wait the log shows After issuing the PO the next step is Release Payment on 28 then on 29 the invoice is received then goods on 210 then match invoice to PO on 211 So they released payment before receiving the invoice and goods Thats a major issue You cant pay before youve received the goods and the invoice because you need to check that the goods were delivered and the invoice matches the PO Paying early could result in overpayment or paying without receiving the goods leading to fraud or errors Also receiving goods after payment is received is problematic Additionally in the standard process receiving goods usually comes before the invoice but in some cases the invoice might come first However the critical point is that payment should come after both the goods are received and the invoice is matched So releasing payment before all these steps is definitely an anomaly"

    "Text": "Case 1004s sequence Create Requisition Approve Requisition Receive Goods before issuing the PO Wait let me check Wait the steps are 1 Create Requisition 2 Approve Requisition 3 Receive Goods 4 Issue PO after receiving goods Thats a problem The PO should be issued before the goods are received How did they receive goods without the PO The PO is the official order to the vendor so receiving goods before the PO is issued doesnt make sense The PO should come first to authorize the purchase Also after receiving goods they issue the PO which is out of order Then after that they get the invoice match it release payment and close Thats a problem because the PO should be there before goods are received The vendor might have sent goods without a valid PO which could lead to unauthorized purchases or disputes Additionally in Case 1004 the sequence is Receive Goods on 26 then Issue PO on the same day Wait looking at the timestamps Case 1004s timeline 20240205 1000 Create Requisition 20240205 1015 Approve Requisition 20240206 0900 Receive Goods 20240206 0915 Issue PO Then invoice comes in etc So they received the goods before issuing the PO Thats definitely an anomaly The PO comes after the requisition is approved but before receiving the goods Otherwise how did the goods arrive without the PO being sent to the vendor"

    "Text": "So summarizing the anomalies Case 1002 Issued PO before approving requisition Released payment before approving requisition and before invoice receipt and matching Case 1003 Released payment before receiving goods and invoice Case 1004 Received goods before issuing the PO Additionally in Case 1002 the approval of the requisition comes after the payment was released Thats a huge problem because the approval should be a prerequisite for proceeding with the purchase order and subsequent steps The payment was released without the requisition being approved which could mean unauthorized transactions Also in Case 1003 the payment was released even before the goods were received Thats a problem because you should verify that goods were received and the invoice matches the PO before paying Paying early might lead to issues where goods arent delivered or the invoice is incorrect Case 1004 The goods were received before the PO was issued Thats impossible unless the vendor sent goods without a valid purchase order which is risky because the company might end up paying for goods they didnt order or didnt authorize The PO is the official document that a vendor should have to know what to deliver Without it there could be discrepancies Let me check if there are any other anomalies Let me go through each case again Case 1002s sequence after the initial steps After creating requisition they issue PO immediately then receive invoice release payment then later approve the requisition So the approval is after payment Thats a key issue Also payment before invoice Wait in the log the invoice was received at 700 AM on 23 then payment was released at 715 AM So payment was just 15 minutes after invoice receipt but before any matching The Match Invoice to PO step is not mentioned until after payment Wait in the log for 1002 after payment they do Receive Goods and then Match Invoice to PO So they paid before matching the invoice which is risky because you need to ensure the invoice matches the PO and the goods received Paying without that check could lead to overpayment or discrepancies Another point in Case 1002 Release Payment is before matching the invoice Thats another problem The standard process requires matching before payment So thats another anomaly Case 1003 They released payment on 28 but received the invoice on 29 and goods on 210 So payment was done before even receiving the invoice or goods Thats way out of order Case 1004 They received goods on 26 but only issued the PO on 26 at 915 The goods were received at 900 so just 15 minutes before the PO was issued That doesnt make sense The PO should be issued first to order the goods Otherwise how did the vendor know to send the goods Maybe the PO was issued after the fact which is bad practice Are there any other anomalies Let me see if theres anything else In Case 1003 after issuing the PO they released payment then later received goods and invoice So the payment was before receiving goods and invoice So thats definitely a problem In Case 1002 the invoice was received then payment was immediately released before matching So they paid without checking if the invoice matches the PO Also the requisition was approved only after the payment So the requisition approval is a key step that was delayed until after critical steps were taken Case 1004 also had the PO issued after goods were received which is backward Another thing to check in Case 1003 the invoice was received after payment which is also problematic because you cant match the invoice to the PO if you havent received the invoice yet But in their case they paid before receiving the invoice Thats a big red flag So summarizing all the anomalies Case 1002 has multiple issues 1 PO issued before requisition approval 2 Payment released before requisition approval before invoice and before matching Case 1003 1 Payment released before invoice received and before goods received 2 Also the payment was done before the goods and invoice which is a major issue Case 1004 1 Goods received before the PO was issued Additionally in Case 1002 the payment was made just 15 minutes after invoice receipt without matching In normal process after receiving the invoice you match it to the PO and verify goods received before paying So these are the main anomalies Let me structure this properly"
