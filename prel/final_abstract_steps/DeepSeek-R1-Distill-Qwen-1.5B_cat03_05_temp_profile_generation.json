Each pair in the trace needs to be considered, so for a trace like <A,B,C,D>, we look at all pairs: (A,B), (A,C), (A,D), (B,C), (B,D), and (C,D)."

The activities involved are SS (Supplier Selection), OP (Order Placement), RC (Receive Components), QI (Quality Inspection), CA (Component Assembly), PT (Product Testing), PK (Packaging), WS (Warehouse Storage), DT (Distribution), and AS (After-Sales Support). So, I need to consider all possible pairs of these activities, in the order they appear in the trace."

RC to QI could take 48 hours, with a standard deviation of 18 hours."

For each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in the event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other), assign an estimated average time and standard deviation.' So, the dictionary should have keys as tuples of activity labels, and values as tuples of (average_time, standard_deviation)."

For each of these, I can assign average times and standard deviations based on typical lead times. For instance, SS is typically a fast process, so the lead time from SS to OP might be a few hours. The standard deviation could be around 6 hours."
