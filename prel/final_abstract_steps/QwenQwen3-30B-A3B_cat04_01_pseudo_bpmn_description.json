Then there's a Gateway (XOR) to check the request type. So, the first decision point is whether the request is standard or custom. That makes sense."

If yes, it goes to Task F: Obtain Manager Approval, then another XOR gateway to see if approval is granted. If yes, generate final invoice (Task G). If no, re-evaluate conditions (Task H) and loop back to either Task E1 (for custom) or Task D (standard). If no approval is needed, just go to Task G.
