The questions should cover rationale, improvements, risk management, decision-making, stakeholder communication, and performance measurement."

    "Text": "First, I need to understand the process thoroughly. The process starts with market research, then RD for the prototype. Components are sourced from different countries in parallel, then shipped to Malaysia for assembly. Quality checks happen, and if passed, they go to packaging and distribution via air or sea. After distribution, inventory and sales monitoring lead to adjusting orders or proceeding to the next cycle."

    "Text": "Now, for each category, I need to generate questions. Lets start with rationale. Why was this specific process structure chosen? Maybe questions about the reasons for parallel gateways or the choice of countries for components."

    "Text": "Improvements could involve optimizing the process. For example, how to reduce lead times or improve quality checks. Risk management might focus on supply chain disruptions, like geopolitical issues affecting component sourcing. Decision-making could relate to the exclusive gateway after quality checks. How are decisions made there? Stakeholder communication might involve how different teams are kept informed during the process. Performance measurement could ask about KPIs used to evaluate each stage."

    "Text": "Wait, I need 20 questions. Let me list them out, making sure each category is addressed. Maybe some questions can touch multiple areas. For example, a question about risk management could also touch on decision-making. Also, check for open-endedness. Avoid leading questions. Use words like how, why, what factors, what strategies."

    "Text": "Let me start drafting: 1. Why was the process structured with parallel gateways? 2. What factors influenced the selection of specific countries for component procurement? 3. How could the process be optimized to reduce lead times during component securing? 4. What risks are associated with relying on multiple international suppliers, and how are they mitigated? 5. Why was Malaysia chosen as the assembly location, and what are the implications? 6. How does the quality check process ensure product reliability before distribution? 7. What criteria determine whether a product is reworked or scrapped after quality checks? 8. How can the decision-making process at the exclusive gateway be improved for faster resolution? 9. What communication strategies are in place to keep stakeholders informed during the supply chain? 10. How does the process handle sudden changes in demand or supply disruptions? 11. What performance metrics are used to evaluate the efficiency of each stage in the process? 12. How can the distribution phase be optimized to balance cost and speed across different markets? 13. What role does inventory monitoring play in adjusting supplier orders? 14. How does the process ensure compliance with varying regional regulations during distribution? 15. What strategies could be implemented to reduce costs in the packaging and shipping phase? 16. How are VIP or pre-orders prioritized in the distribution process? 17. What are the potential bottlenecks in the current process, and how can they be addressed? 18. How does the process adapt to technological advancements in smartphone manufacturing? 19. What feedback mechanisms exist to continuously improve the supply chain based on performance data? 20. How can stakeholder collaboration be enhanced to improve decision-making across different regions?"

    "Text": "Hmm, thats 20. Let me check if they cover all required areas. Rationale (1,2,5), improvements (3,7,8,12,15,17,18,19), risk management (4,10), decision-making (8,13), stakeholder communication (9,14,16,19), performance measurement (11,19). Seems covered. Some questions might overlap categories, which is okay as long as they are open-ended. I think this should work."
