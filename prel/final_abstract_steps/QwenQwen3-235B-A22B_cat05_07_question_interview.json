    "Text": "First the process starts when a landlord contacts the regional office The property coordinator checks documents and if anything is missing they ask for updates Then they enter the property details into the database Next they assign a property manager based on workload geography experience and track record Then theres an introductory meeting with the landlord Then scheduling a photographer and inspector If there are issues from the inspection they get fixed Then marketing materials are prepared and the property is activated online Tenant screening follows including credit checks references etc If there are multiple applicants they might negotiate terms Once a tenant is selected the lease is finalized Finally there are quality checks and audits by compliance finance and IT Exceptions like special insurance or custom lease clauses are mentioned"

    "Text": "1 Documentation Review How do they determine which documents are required Are there standard checklists How often are documents missing How long does this step usually take 2 Property Database Entry What specific details are recorded besides square footage units etc Are there any validations in place when entering data 3 Assigning Property Manager How exactly are the factors workload geography experience weighted Is there a system that suggests the best manager or is it manual How often does the assignment get changed after initial assignment 4 Introductory Call Whats the typical outcome of this meeting Are there common disagreements or issues that come up here 5 Photographer and Inspector How are these vendors selected Are they thirdparty How long does this step take Whats the process if the inspector finds issues How often does that happen How are repairs prioritized 6 Marketing Materials How is the pricing model updated What market trends are considered How long does marketing take to prepare listings 7 Activation in Portal Is there a checklist to ensure all steps are done before activation What if the property isnt ready on time 8 Tenant Screening How long does screening take Who handles itthe manager or leasing agent What are the criteria for selecting a tenant beyond credit checks How are conflicts resolved when multiple tenants are interested 9 Finalizing Lease How are security deposits handled Are there standard lease templates or are they customized often How does the compliance check fit in here 10 Quality Checks Who does the compliance review How long does each audit take What happens if discrepancies are found How often do errors occur Exceptions Handling special insurance or custom clauses How are these exceptions escalated Who has the authority to approve custom clauses How often are there exceptions Communication How is communication tracked across teams Are there delays due to miscommunication What tools are used besides CRM and project management Timing and Sequencing How long does the entire process take on average Are there steps that can be done in parallel Which steps are most likely to cause delays Decision Criteria For example when assigning a manager how do they balance workload vs experience Whats the priority Roles Are the roles of property coordinator manager leasing agent distinct or overlapping Whats the structure of the team Other How is success measured for the onboarding process What metrics do they track Have they had feedback from landlords about the process"
