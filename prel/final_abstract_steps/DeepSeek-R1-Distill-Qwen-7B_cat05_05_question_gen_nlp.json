    "Text": "The process begins with RD teams designing new smartphone models then sourcing components from various international suppliers like Taiwan Japan South Korea Germany and the US Each supplier has different lead times quality metrics and contractual terms These components are then assembled in Malaysia a main assembly plant using 247 operations with workers and automated machinery Quality checks and diagnostic tests are performed there"
