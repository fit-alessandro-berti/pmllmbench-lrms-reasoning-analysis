Then they receive invoice before receiving goods. Then release payment before receiving goods. Then later they approve requisition later (08:00 after payment). Also they receive goods after payment and approval. This violates order: approval must happen before PO issuance, receiving goods before invoice, matching before payment, etc. So anomalies: issuing PO before approval, receiving invoice before receipt of goods, releasing payment before receipt, approval after payment."

Actually sequence: Create PR, Approve PR, Receive Goods (09:00), Issue PO (09:15), Vendor Invoice Received (08:00) – Wait timestamp: Vendor Invoice Received is 2024-02-06 08:00 which is before Issue PO (09:15) and before Receive Goods? Actually Receive Goods timestamp is 2024-02-06 09:00, after invoice receipt? Let's reorder: Create PR (10:00), Approve PR (10:15), Receive Goods (09:00) – but timestamp shows 09:00 before approve? Actually timestamp: 2024-02-06 09:00 Receive Goods, then 2024-02-06 09:15 Issue PO, then 2024-02-07 08:00 Vendor Invoice Received, then 2024-02-07 08:30 Match Invoice to PO, then 2024-02-07 09:00 Release Payment. So they received goods before PO issuance, which is impossible; also invoice received before PO issuance; matching occurs after invoice receipt but before payment; but they matched after invoice receipt before payment; maybe okay. But still receiving goods before PO is abnormal."
