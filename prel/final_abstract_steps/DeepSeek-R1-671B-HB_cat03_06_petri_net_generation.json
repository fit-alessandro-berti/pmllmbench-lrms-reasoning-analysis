    "Text": "So, our steps:\n\n- Create all places and transitions.\n\nStart with source place, connected to CR.\n\nAfter CR, P_CR (a place) connected to DV.\n\nAfter DV, P_DV place. From there, transitions RDS (with arcs back to P_CR) and FC (proceed to FC).\n\nWait, no. If after DV, the RDS leads back to the input of DV, which is P_CR. So RDS transition would have an input arc from P_DV, and an output arc to P_CR.\n\nThen from P_DV, FC's transition would take the token and proceed.\n\nFor FC, the place after FC is P_FC. From there, transitions II (looping back to the input of FC's transition) and CA (proceeding).\n\nSo II's input is P_FC and output is the same as FC's input place, which is after FC's step. Wait, maybe I'm getting confused here. Let me think again.\n\nAfter DV is the place p_dv. FC's transition has input p_dv and output p_fc. From p_fc, the process can either proceed to CA, or go through II, which would loop back to p_dv (so that FC can be executed again). But then II's output is to p_dv, which is the input of FC. But FC's input is p_dv, so after II, the token is again in p_dv. Then FC would fire again. This would allow multiple FC and II loops.\n\nWait, that's possible. So after FC is done (token in p_fc), if II is needed, the II transition takes the token from p_fc and puts it back into p_dv. Then FC can fire again. But wait, FC's input is p_dv, which requires a token. So after II, the token is in p_dv, enabling FC again. So FC is executed again, leading to p_fc again. So the loop between FC and II is modeled by having II transition take the token from p_fc and put it back to p_dv. That way, FC can fire again. Then, each time FC fires, the process can decide to proceed to CA (from p_fc) or loop back via II.\n\nBut that would require that the II transition is connected from p_fc to p_dv. So the II transition's input is p_fc, and its output is p_dv. So II's output brings the token to p_dv again. Then, FC can fire again, which is correct.\n\nSo, FC's flow:\n\nFC has input p_dv, output p_fc.\n\nII transition has input p_fc and output p_dv.\n\nThus, the loop FC  II  FC is possible.\n\nSimilarly, RDS transition has input p_dv (since it's after DV), and output p_cr (which is the input to DV). So RDS brings the token back to the start of DV.\n\nWait, p_cr is after CR. So CR transition's output is p_cr, which is input to DV.\n\nYes. So RDS's output is p_cr, allowing DV to be triggered again.\n\nSo for the DV loop: RDS takes token from p_dv (output of DV), and puts it back into p_cr (input to DV). So when RDS fires, DV is executed again.\n\nThat's correct.\n\nNow, moving to the CA step.\n\nAfter FC's output (p_fc), the process can either go to II (looping back) or proceed to CA (transition from p_fc to p_ca). Then CA's output is p_ca.\n\nFrom p_ca, the process checks if AP is required. So p_ca can go to AP transition (which requires approval) or a silent transition (no label) that skips AP.\n\nAP's input is p_ca, output is p_ap. Then the AP transition leads to p_ap, which is input to Payment (P).\n\nThe silent transition (let's call it 'skip_AP') would take p_ca as input and output p_ap_skip (a place that leads to P). Wait, no. Alternatively, both AP and skip_AP transitions would take p_ca as input and output to the same place (p_p), which is the input to P. That way, regardless of whether AP is done or skipped, the process proceeds to P.\n\nWait, but perhaps AP's output is a place (p_ap) which connects to P, and the silent transition outputs directly to P's input place (p_p). So after CA, the two paths from p_ca are:\n\n- AP  p_ap  P.\n\n- skip_AP  p_p  P.\n\nBut then P would need to have two input places? Not possible. So perhaps the AP and skip_AP transitions both output to the same place. So whether AP is done or skipped, once approved or not, the process proceeds to P. That makes sense.\n\nSo:\n\np_ca  AP  p_p.\n\np_ca  skip_AP  p_p.\n\nThus, AP and skip_AP are two transitions, with input p_ca and output p_p.\n\nAP is labeled \"Approval\", skip_AP is a silent transition (label None).\n\nThen p_p is input to P transition.\n\nAfter P, there's a place p_p_done, which leads to N (Notification).\n\nN's output is p_n, which leads to CL (Closure). CL's output is sink place.\n\nThus, the final marking requires a token in the sink place.\n\nNow, the initial marking is im = Marking() with source:1.\n\nim = Marking()\nim[source] = 1\n\nFinal marking is fm = Marking() with sink:1.\n\nfm = Marking()\nfm[sink] = 1"
