    "Text": "Starting with the Start Event, the first task is Receive Customer Request. That makes sense as the initial step. Then theres an XOR gateway to check the request type. XOR gateways are exclusive, so only one path is taken based on the condition. So if the request is standard, it goes to Task B1 for standard validation. If its custom, it goes to B2 for custom feasibility analysis."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For the standard path, after validation, theres an AND gateway for parallel checks: credit and inventory. AND means both tasks run in parallel. Once both are done, they join back, then calculate the delivery date. That seems logical because both checks are needed before moving forward."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "On the custom path, after feasibility analysis, another XOR gateway checks if its feasible. If yes, prepare a custom quotation. If no, send a rejection. So thats a decision point based on the analysis."

    "Text": "After either standard or custom path completes, theres another XOR gateway asking if approval is needed. If yes, then obtain manager approval. Another XOR here checks if approval is granted. If yes, generate invoice. If no, re-evaluate conditions, which loops back to either the custom quotation or the standard delivery date task. That loop is important for rework."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I need to explain each steps purpose. For example, the XOR gateways are decision points, AND is for parallel tasks. The loop back from re-evaluation means that if approval is denied, the process goes back to adjust the quotation or delivery date. The difference between standard and custom is in the validation steps and the feasibility check. Approvals are triggered based on some condition, maybe the type of request or other factors. Rework happens when approval is denied, sending it back to specific tasks."

The key is to clarify the flow, the decision points, parallel tasks, and loops. Make sure to highlight the conditions under which each path is taken and how the process handles different scenarios."
