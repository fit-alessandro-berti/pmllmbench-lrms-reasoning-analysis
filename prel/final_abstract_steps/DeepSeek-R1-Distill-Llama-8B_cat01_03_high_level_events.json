    "Text": "So, for CaseID A1, the events start at 08:00:05 with Retrieve raw metal sheet by Operator A. Then, Operator A scans the barcode, places the metal sheet on the table, aligns it, preheats it, picks up a welding tool, welds two corners, measures the weld integrity, applies a coating, dries the coating, and finally does a visual check."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at these, it seems like the first few events are all about preparing the metal sheet. Retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating all fit into Material Preparation. Then, welding and applying coating would be part of Welding and Finishing, followed by a quality check in Quality Inspection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Similarly, for CaseID B2, the events are almost identical except for some minor differences in timestamps and details, but the structure is the same. So, the same grouping would apply: Material Preparation, Welding and Finishing, Quality Inspection."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I think the key here is to identify sequences where the same resource or activity is performed in a logical order. For example, after retrieving and preparing the metal sheet, the next step is welding, which naturally follows. Then, coating and drying are part of finishing the piece, followed by a check."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, breaking it down: 1. Material Preparation includes all events from retrieving the sheet to preheating. This makes sense because it's the initial setup before any assembly or welding happens. 2. Welding and Finishing covers the actual welding of the corners and the application of the coating. Welding is a critical step, and applying the coating is part of finishing the piece. 3. Quality Inspection is the final check to ensure everything is done correctly. The visual check and integrity measurement are both quality checks."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I should make sure that each group is distinct and represents a coherent stage. Also, the events within each group are temporally close and logically sequential. This way, the higher-level steps will clearly represent the manufacturing process stages."
