    "Text": "First, I'll parse each interview transcript to extract relevant information. Let's look at Interview 1. Mary talks about the invoice approval process. She checks if a purchase order exists, sends it back if not, logs it into the system, forwards to purchasing for confirmation. Then she matches items with the PO. If there's a discrepancy, she emails the purchasing team. She mentions that after confirming, she sends to the manager and schedules payment. The manager's approval is triggered after confirming the PO. Similarly, Interview 2 mentions Dan's perspective. He checks the invoice details against the PO. If there's a discrepancy, he contacts the supplier or AP clerk. He confirms with Dan and sends confirmation. If the PO is missing, he asks Mary to get info. They confirm, then the manager approves, and the payment happens. Interview 3, Carlos, says he's involved in the last step. Once the invoice is matched, he gets the details, checks for discrepancies, and approves. If there's a problem, he checks and maybe rejects or asks for investigation. After approval, he believes it goes back to AP for payment. Interview 4, Rita, explains her role in exceptions. If Mary can't match the invoice, she escalates. She works with suppliers or departments. If invoices don't match PO because they're informal, she helps create PO or decide to reject. Then the invoice goes back to normal flow. Interview 5, Karen, says she's involved indirectly. If AP or Purchasing finds discrepancies, they call her. She maintains supplier relationships. If the invoice has missing info, she asks suppliers. If there's a pricing issue, she checks the contract. She doesn't touch the system directly but helps resolve issues."
