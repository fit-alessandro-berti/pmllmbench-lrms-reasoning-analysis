Similarly, Pick Items (PI) can't happen until RI has been done. So (PI, RI). And Quality Check (QC) after Pick Items. So (QC, PI). Then Pack Order (PO) would require QC to have happened before.

But wait, the Always Before was (RI, CA), because RI can't happen unless CA was before. But after CA, you must have RI. So maybe CA is the first activity, then RI must always come after. So for Always After, the pair would be (CA, RI). Because if CA occurs, then RI must happen after. Hmm, but earlier I considered RI and CA as equivalent. Wait, perhaps equivalence and always_before/after can overlap. Let me think again. Equivalence is same number of occurrences, so if CA occurs once, RI occurs once. So equivalence would handle the co-occurrence. The always_before would ensure RI happens after CA. Wait, maybe that's not necessary. If they are equivalent, their counts are same, but maybe the order isn't enforced. So if they are equivalent, but in terms of order, we still need to set RI to come after CA. So maybe we need both equivalence and an always_before constraint for (RI, CA), so that whenever RI occurs, CA has been before. But since equivalence ensures that whenever CA occurs, RI occurs the same number of times. So maybe equivalence takes care of the occurrence counts, but the ordering is handled by always_before and always_after. For example, in equivalence, maybe they have same counts, but they can be in any order. So perhaps to enforce that CA comes before RI, we need both (RI, CA) in always_before. And (CA, RI) in always_after. Wait, but if you have equivalence, maybe the order is not enforced. For example, if two activities are equivalent, but they could happen in any order, so maybe each must always come after the other? That doesn't make sense. So perhaps equivalence implies that each occurs whenever the other occurs, but their order is determined by other constraints. So in this case, CA and RI are equivalent. So whenever CA occurs, RI occurs the same number of times. But to enforce that RI happens after CA, there's an always_before constraint on RI (so RI can't happen unless CA has happened before) and maybe also always_after on CA (so after CA, RI must happen). Let's see. So if CA occurs, then RI must occur after (so added to always_after for (CA, RI)). And for RI, because they can't occur unless CA has occurred, so (RI, CA) in always_before. So CA and RI are equivalence, and also have these before/after constraints. That makes sense."

But RO is the first activity. So whenever any activity occurs, RO must have happened before. But maybe all activities except RO have an always_before constraint pointing to RO, because RO is the starting point. Wait, but that might be redundant. Let me think. If RO is the initial step, then every other activity must come after RO. So for each activity A (except RO), whenever A occurs, RO must have been executed before. So (A, RO) would be in always_before. But in the always_before, the first activity in the tuple is the one that requires the second to have occurred before. So if you have (A, RO) in always_before, then if A occurs, RO must have happened before. But that's not correct. Wait, the description says: \"If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously.\" So tuple (A, B) in always_before means \"if A occurs, then B must have happened before.\" So for all activities except RO, we need (A, RO) in always_before.

Alternatively, perhaps the order is such that RO must be the first event, but how to model that. But perhaps in the log skeleton, it's necessary to model that any other activity requires RO to have happened before. So all activities except RO have (activity, RO) in always_before.
