The challenge is to match events based on order ID and timing, with a 2-second tolerance."

So these are separate events."

For the Order Received match, it's 2 seconds exactly (from 09:59:58 to 10:00:00 is 2 seconds). Wait, actually 09:59:58 to 10:00:00 is 2 seconds? Let's calculate: from 09:59:58 to 10:00:00 is 2 seconds later. So it's exactly 2 seconds. The requirement says less than 2 seconds, so this might be borderline.
