Because between t1 and t3 theres another event in the same case Therefore, according to our logic, such cases are excluded because they dont meet the no other events condition But how do we model that? We need to ensure that after an approval, there are no subsequent events from the same case until a create order occurs This requires checking for all possible pairs of Approve, Create Order in each case and ensuring that between them theres no event from the same case But this is not feasible with SQL unless we use recursive queries or something else"
