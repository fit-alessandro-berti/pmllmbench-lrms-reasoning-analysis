Oh right, DuckDB supports standard SQL including window functions like LAG and LEAD. So perhaps for each row in the event_log table, we can look at the previous two events (using LAG) to see if they form 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order', then check if the current row's activity is 'Confirm Order'.

Then it's valid. So regardless of how much time is between them (as long as there's no intervening event), they form a valid triplet. Wait, that's not possible because 'direct succession' might imply that the three activities happen one after another without any interruption in activity sequence. But according to the problem statement: 'no other event from the same case in between them'. So it's about events (regardless of their type) occurring between those three specific activities for the same case. So even if there's an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by a 'Create Order', then after some time, say 5 days later, another activity like 'Process Invoice', but no other event from that case occurs in between. Wait, but that's impossible because you can't have events only at those three times. Unless the log doesn't record any other events for this particular path. But according to DuckDB's capabilities, we need a way to check if there are intervening rows (events) with timestamp >= t3 and <= when 'Confirm Order' occurs in some cases? No, because that could be ambiguous. Alternatively, perhaps use a window function to look at the next occurrence of each activity. For example: For an event A ('Approve Purchase Requisition'), check if there exists a subsequent event B ('Create Order') such that there's no other events from the same case occurring after B but before any 'Confirm Order' in some later path. But this seems too vague. Alternatively, to model it as follows: for each occurrence of 'Approving', we can look ahead and see if within 5 days (but that's not required) there is a Create Order followed by Confirm Order. But the problem requires that regardless of time gaps between Approve and Create Order, but no intervening events from the same case. So perhaps using window functions to track sequences: For each event in the log, we can check if it's part of an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> next is 'Create Order' without any other events (from the same case) occurring after it until a subsequent 'Confirm Order'. But how? Alternatively, create a CTE that identifies all possible triplets. Let's think: First, for each event where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', check the next two rows in time (if they exist) and see if they form Create Order followed by Confirm Order with no intervening activities from the same case between them. But this would only capture triplets of three consecutive events. However, there might be longer sequences after that which are part of another valid sequence. Alternatively, perhaps for each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event: Check the next two rows in time (if they exist) and see if those form Create Order followed by Confirm Order with no intervening activities from the same case between them. Wait, but according to the problem statement, we need any occurrence where these three actions happen in succession without other events from the same case in between those specific actions. So even if there's an 'Approve', followed by some event (from a different process instance?), then later Create Order and Confirm Order for this case—no, because it's specified as 'the same case'. So perhaps the triplet must be consecutive within the timeline of that particular case. Therefore, using window functions to look ahead: For each row in the log where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', we can check if there exists a subsequent event (same case) which is 'Create Order' and then another subsequent event ('Confirm Order') with no other events from the same case occurring between them. But how? Alternatively, use LEAD to look at next two activities for each row where activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. Wait, here's an idea: We can create a CTE that first identifies all possible triplets of three consecutive rows in time (ordered by timestamp) within the same case. Then, among these triplets, check if they form exactly the sequence 'Approve', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'. For each such triplet, we then need to select those cases where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. But how do we model consecutive rows in a case? Because even within the same case, events can be non-consecutive if there are gaps. However, DuckDB's window functions allow us to partition by case_id and order by timestamp. Wait, but grouping by LEAD/LAG might not group them into sequences unless they follow each other without interruption. But how? Alternatively, for all possible triplets of rows (i.e., any three consecutive events in time) from the same case that form 'Approve', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' in order. But this approach would capture cases where there are multiple such sequences overlapping or nested within others, which might not be desired. But according to the problem statement, we need all triplets of these actions occurring in succession with no intervening events from the same case between them. Wait, perhaps using window functions LEAD and LAG twice: For each row (except the first two), check if activity is 'Confirm Order', previous is 'Create Order' which was preceded by an 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. So for a given Confirm event in a triplet, we have: activity = 'Confirm Order' LAG(1) over timestamp from current row: prev_activity LAG(SAFE_LAG(1)) over activity: prev_prev_activity. Then check if prev_prev_activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and prev_activity is 'Create Order'. If so, this triplet exists in the log for that case. But then we need to select all such rows (Approve, Create Order, Confirm) where there's no intervening events from the same case between them. However, using LAG/SAFE_LAG only checks up to one row back and forward respectively, which may not account for multiple intervening events. For example: Case: t1 - Approve t2 - Other Activity X (same case) t3 - Create Order t4 - Confirm Order In this scenario, the triplet from t1, t3, t4 would be valid if there's no other activity between them. But according to our previous logic using LAG/SAFE_LAG: For row t4 (Confirm), we check that prev_prev_activity is Approve and prev_activity is Create Order. So it counts as a valid triplet. But in reality, there was an intervening event at t2 which makes this not the first occurrence of such activities for the case. However, according to our approach using LAG/SAFE_LAG, it's still considered part of a triplet because we are only looking one step back and forward. But that would miss cases where there's an intermediate activity. Therefore, this approach is insufficient. Hmm, so perhaps DuckDB doesn't support such advanced window functions for multi-step lookups without intervening events."

So perhaps create a recursive CTE where we start with the first possible 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event and then recursively add subsequent events as long as they follow one of the three steps without any intervening activities from the same case. But I'm not sure if recursion can be used here. Let's think: For example, starting with an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' at time t1 in case_id X.

Alternatively, since DuckDB supports standard SQL functions including window functions, maybe we can use a combination of LEAD and LAG to check for possible triplets.

Then look for subsequent events (in time order) from the same case, and check if they form part of the triplet sequence without any intervening steps.

This is tricky because it requires that after an 'Approve Purchase Requisition', there are no subsequent events from the same case until a 'Create Order' occurs. Then, after 'Create Order', again no intervening events before a later 'Confirm Order'. So perhaps using window functions to track possible sequences. Let me think of another approach: For each event in the log, check if it's part of any triplet where there are three consecutive activities as specified with no other events from that case between them. But how? Alternative Idea: Use two CTEs. First, find all cases that have at least one 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by a subsequent 'Create Order', and then after some time (but not necessarily directly), has a 'Confirm Order'. But this would include multiple occurrences of the triplet in different parts of the log. But even more importantly, between these three events, there should be no other events from the same case. So for example: Case 1: t1 - Approve t2 - Some Activity X (from Case 1) t3 - Create Order This would not count as a valid triplet because there's an intervening event at t2. But if after 'Approve' there are no events from the same case until 'Create Order', then that's acceptable. So how to model that in SQL? One approach is to use window functions with LEAD and LAG, but also check for absence of other activities in between. However, this seems difficult because you can't easily filter out all possible intervening rows unless they are explicitly present. Alternatively, perhaps the problem allows us to consider any occurrence where 'Approve' is followed by 'Create Order' which is immediately followed by 'Confirm Order', regardless of time gaps and without considering other events in between. But that's not what the prompt says. Wait, let's re-read the original problem statement: 'no other event from the same case in between them.' So 'in between them' would mean any other event that occurs after the first activity ('Approve') but before the third activity ('Confirm Order'). Therefore, such events (from the same case) must not exist. Therefore, for a given 'Approve Purchase Requisition' at time t1, there should be no subsequent event from the same case with timestamp >= t1 and < timestamp of 'Create Order', nor any other event between that occurs after Create Order until Confirm Order. Wait, but this is impossible to check unless you have information about all events in a certain timeframe. Which might not be feasible if the log has millions of rows. Therefore, perhaps DuckDB can use window functions with LEAD/LAG to model sequences and then exclude cases where intervening events exist. An alternative approach: Use a CTE that identifies for each case, any occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by later an event from the same case which is 'Create Order' without any other events occurring in between (i.e., no rows with timestamp >= t1 and < ts_create_order). But how to model this? This seems complex. Maybe a different approach: For each row where activity is 'Confirm Order', check if its immediate predecessor was 'Create Order' which itself had an immediate previous of 'Approve Purchase Requisition'. Then, among those cases, calculate the time between Create Order and Confirm Order. Wait, but that would capture only consecutive events in the log. However, there could be other activities from different paths within the same case after some delay. For example: Case 1: t1 - Approve t2 - Some Activity X (same case) t3 - Create Order t4 - Confirm Order In this scenario, between 'Approve' and 'Create Order', there's an event at t2 which is another activity from the same case. Therefore, this triplet would not be considered valid because of Event X. But according to our previous logic, such a case should be excluded if it has any intervening events between parts of the sequence. Wait, but the problem requires that there are no other events (from the same case) in between 'Approve' and 'Create Order', or from 'Create Order' until 'Confirm Order'. So perhaps we can model this by ensuring that after an 'Approve Purchase Requisition' event at t1, all subsequent events up to when a 'Create Order' occurs are only part of creating this triplet. But that's not feasible unless you track the time ranges. Alternatively, use window functions with LEAD and LAG to look ahead for possible sequences. Let me try an example: Suppose we have three rows in the log (same case) ordered by timestamp: Row1: Approve Purchase Requisition Row2: Some Activity X (timestamp between Row1 and Row3) Row3: Create Order Then this is invalid because there's Event X from same case. But if there are no such events, then it's valid. So how do we model that? One approach could be to use a CTE where for each 'Approve' event, check the next two rows in time (if they exist) and see if they form Create Order followed by Confirm Order with no intervening activities from the same case between them. But this seems not sufficient because there could be events after that triplet which are part of another sequence. Wait, but according to the problem statement, we need any occurrence where these three actions happen in succession without other events from the same case in between those specific actions. So even if there's an 'Approve', followed by some event (from a different process instance?), then later Create Order and Confirm Order for this case—no, because it's specified as 'the same case'. This is extremely complex to model with SQL because you can't track all possible paths within DuckDB without recursive queries or something else. Given that I'm stuck, perhaps the intended solution is to use window functions LEAD and LAG twice for each row where activity is 'Confirm Order' and its previous two activities are 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order', then calculate the time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order. So here's a possible query: WITH triplets AS ( SELECT case_id, timestamp, LAG(SAFE_LAG(1) OVER w.timestamp, 2) OVER PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC AS prev_prev_activity, LAG(1) OVER PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC AS prev_activity, activity FROM event_log WINDOW w(timestamp DESC, activity ASC) ), valid_triplets AS ( SELECT case_id, timestamp, prev_prev_activity, prev_activity FROM triplets WHERE prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND prev_activity = 'Create Order' ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM valid_triplets vt WHERE vt.case_id = e.case_id AND vt.timestamp < e.timestamp - interval '5 days' ); But this would select all events from cases that have a triplet where the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. But we need to exclude those cases, so we should NOT return any events from these cases. Wait, but according to the problem statement: after identifying such cases (those with triplets and time diff >5), they must be excluded from the final result. So in DuckDB SQL, this would mean returning all events except those that belong to such cases. Therefore, the correct approach is: 1. Find all cases where there exists a sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', then later 'Confirm Order' with no intervening events from the same case between them, and time between Create Order and Confirm Order >5 days. 2. Exclude any event from these cases in the final result. So to exclude such cases: We can use a LEFT JOIN where for each row e in event_log, if its case_id is part of any such valid triplet meeting the timing condition, then we filter it out. Therefore, the query would be something like: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE (case_id NOT IN ( WITH triplets AS ( SELECT vt.case_id, MIN(et.timestamp) as create_order_time, MAX(et.timestamp) as confirm_order_time FROM valid_triplets vt JOIN event_log et ON vt.case_id = et.case_id AND et.activity = 'Create Order' WHERE vt.prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND vt.prev_activity = 'Create Order' AND (vt.confirm_order_time - vt.create_order_time) > interval '5 days' ) SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM triplets ) ); But this approach requires checking for each event whether its case is in any valid triplet meeting the time condition. Alternatively, using a CTE to identify all such cases and then excluding them via NOT IN clause. Putting it all together: WITH validated_sequences AS ( SELECT e.case_id, MIN(e.timestamp) as create_order_time, MAX(e.timestamp) as confirm_order_time FROM event_log e JOIN event_log ec ON e.case_id = ec.case_id AND ec.activity = 'Create Order' WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE case_id = e.case_id AND activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND e.timestamp < ec.timestamp - interval '5 days' -- Not sure, this part is unclear. ) GROUP BY e.case_id ), SELECT e.* FROM event_log e WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM validated_sequences vs WHERE vs.case_id = e.case_id AND (vs.confirm_order_time - vs.create_order_time) > interval '5 days' ); But this is very hand-wavy and not correctly modeling the conditions. Given time constraints and complexity, perhaps the correct approach is to use window functions LEAD/SAFE_LAG twice for each row where activity is 'Confirm Order' and check if its immediate previous two activities are 'Approve Purchase Requisition' followed by 'Create Order'. Then calculate the time difference between Create Order and Confirm Order. Then exclude those cases from the final result. Here's a query that might work: WITH triplets AS ( SELECT case_id, timestamp, LAG(SAFE_LAG(1) OVER w.timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC) as prev_prev_activity, LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC) as prev_activity FROM event_log WINDOW W(timestamp DESC, activity ASC) ), valid_cases AS ( SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM triplets WHERE prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND prev_activity = 'Create Order' ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e LEFT JOIN valid_cases vc ON e.case_id = vc.case_id WHERE vc.case_id IS NULL; But this would exclude cases where there's a consecutive triplet. However, the problem requires excluding any case that has such a sequence (even non-consecutive) with no intervening events from the same case between them. Given that DuckDB doesn't support complex window functions to check for all possible pairs of 'Approve' and subsequent 'Create Order' without intermediate events, this might not be feasible. But perhaps the intended solution assumes consecutive triplets in time order, regardless of other events. Assuming that approach: The query would look like this: WITH valid_sequences AS ( SELECT case_id, MIN(timestamp) as create_order_time, MAX(timestamp) as confirm_order_time FROM event_log WHERE activity IN ('Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order') GROUP BY case_id ), filtered_cases AS ( SELECT vs.case_id FROM valid_sequences vs JOIN event_log ec ON vs.case_id = ec.case_id AND ec.activity = 'Create Order' LEFT JOIN event_log cc ON vs.case_id = cc.case_id AND cc.activity = 'Confirm Order' AND cc.timestamp > ec.timestamp WHERE cc.activity IS NOT NULL AND (cc.timestamp - ec.timestamp) > interval '5 days' ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e WHERE e.case_id NOT IN ( SELECT case_id FROM filtered_cases ); But this approach is incorrect because it filters based on existing triplets, not checking for the presence of all three activities in order. Given the complexity and time constraints, I'll proceed with the following query that uses window functions to check consecutive triplets: The final answer would be a CTE identifying cases where 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order', then later 'Confirm Order' without intervening events. Then exclude those cases from the results. But given DuckDB's capabilities, here's a possible solution using LEAD and LAG to find consecutive triplets: WITH sequences AS ( SELECT case_id, timestamp, activity, -- Check if current row is part of an 'Approve' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' sequence in time order. CASE WHEN prev_prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' AND LAG(1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC) = 'Create Order' AND activity = 'Confirm Order' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS is_sequence_end FROM ( SELECT *, -- Previous two activities using window functions. LAG(SAFE_LAG(1), 2) OVER w.timestamp PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC AS prev_prev_activity, LAG(1) OVER w.timestamp PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp ASC AS prev_activity FROM event_log WINDOW W(timestamp DESC, activity ASC) ) s ), -- Identify the 'Confirm Order' events that are part of such sequences. confirmed_orders AS ( SELECT case_id, MAX(timestamp) as confirm_timestamp FROM sequences WHERE is_sequence_end = 1 GROUP BY case_id ), -- Calculate time between Create Order and Confirm Order for each triplet. time_diff AS ( SELECT e.case_id, MIN(e.timestamp) as create_time, co.confirm_timestamp FROM event_log e JOIN confirmed_orders co ON e.case_id = co.case_id WHERE e.activity = 'Create Order' AND e.timestamp < co.confirm_timestamp GROUP BY e.case_id, co.confirm_timestamp ) -- Select cases where time difference is more than 5 days. filtered_cases AS ( SELECT case_id FROM time_diff WHERE (co.confirm_timestamp - create_time) > interval '5 days' ) SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE NOT EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM filtered_cases fc WHERE e.case_id = fc.case_id ); This query first identifies the triplets in sequences, then finds cases where Create Order and Confirm Order are more than 5 days apart. These cases are excluded from the final result. However, this approach may not correctly handle all scenarios due to DuckDB's window function limitations."
