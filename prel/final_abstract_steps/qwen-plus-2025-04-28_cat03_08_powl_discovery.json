So, the loop node would have transitions to A and B. But the operator is * (A, B), which implies that when you execute the loop, you first execute A, then either you exit (so the loop ends) or execute B and then A again. So, the loop node would have a transition to A and a transition to B, and the operator would be * (A, B), meaning that the loop is executed by first executing A, then either exiting or executing B and then A again.\n\nSo, the loop node would be a node that, when executed, first executes A (TST), then either exits the loop (so the process continues) or executes B (RT) and then A again (TST). Therefore, the loop node would have transitions to A and B, and the operator is * (A, B).\n\nSo, in the event log, after TST, the process can either go to RT (and then back to TST) or proceed to the next step.
