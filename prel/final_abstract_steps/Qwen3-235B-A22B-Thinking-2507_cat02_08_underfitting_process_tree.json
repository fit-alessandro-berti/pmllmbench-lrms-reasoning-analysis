But in reality: - Must authorize payment BEFORE packaging (since you wouldnt package unpaid items) - Must package BEFORE shipping So invalid sequences like: Receive -> Check -> Ship -> Package -> Auth -> Close This would be allowed because parallel means all orders are permitted, but domain-wise its nonsense - you cant ship before packaging or authorizing payment."

It should be a strict sequence: Auth -> Pack -> Ship. Additionally, theres the issue of the extra Close_Order in cancel path, but the parallel ordering violation seems more critical as it breaks core business logic."
