    "Text": "Case 1004 Receive Goods at 0900 Then Issue PO at 0915 Wait thats after receiving goods Thats a problem Because the PO should be issued after the PR is approved but before receiving goods Receiving goods without a purchase order is a big issue So receiving goods before issuing the PO Thats an anomaly So the main anomaly here is the PO issued after goods received Thats a problem"

    "Text": "Now let me check each case again to ensure I didnt miss anything Starting with 1002 again So the payment was done before approving the PR before receiving goods Thats super risky Case 1003 The payment was released on the 8th but the invoice came on the 9th and goods received on the 10th So they paid before even receiving the goods or invoice Thats a problem Case 1004 The main issue is the PO after receiving goods How did they receive the goods without a PO Thats a control issue"

    "Text": "Another point in Case 1003 the payment is made before the invoice is even received Thats impossible because you cant pay without an invoice Wait maybe the invoice was received on the 9th but the payment was on the 8th So they paid before the invoice arrived Thats a problem because you need the invoice to know what to pay So thats another issue"
