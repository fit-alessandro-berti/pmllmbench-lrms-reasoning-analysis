    "Text": "First, I'll read through the process description again to make sure I understand all the components involved. The supply chain starts with R&D designing new smartphone models, then sourcing components from various international suppliers. Each supplier has different lead times, quality metrics, and contracts. The components are shipped to an assembly plant in Malaysia, which operates 24/7. After assembly, the phones are sent to regional distribution centers using different transport methods, coordinating with logistics partners for customs and compliance. Depending on the market, they use different replenishment strategies. Once at the distribution centers, products are sent to retailers or consumers, with planners tracking inventory and adjusting orders. There's also a focus on quality assurance, compliance, and continuous improvement."
