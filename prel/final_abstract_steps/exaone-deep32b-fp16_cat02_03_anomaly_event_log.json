Issue Purchase Order 4. Receive Goods (or materials) 5. Vendor Invoice Received 6. Match Invoice to Purchase Order (to ensure the invoice matches the PO for accuracy) 7. Release Payment (after approval, once everything is matched) 8. Close the Case. The key here is the order of these steps."

Because the Purchase Requisition must be approved before the Purchase Order can be issued... the approval of the PR is happening after the PO was already issued. That's a major anomaly... The approval must come before issuing the PO. So this is a clear anomaly."

    "Text": "Hmm, so between 2/10 and 2/12, there's a missing step. The correct sequence after matching the invoice should be to release payment, then close the case. Here, after matching on 2/10, the next activity is closing on 2/12 without releasing payment. So the Release Payment step is missing. That's an anomaly. So case 1003 is missing the Release Payment step."

But that's before issuing the PO. That's a problem. Because you can't receive goods before issuing the Purchase Order. The Purchase Order must be issued before the vendor can ship the goods. So receiving goods before the PO is issued is impossible. Therefore, this is an anomaly."

    "Text": "Now, explaining why they are problematic: For Case 1002's first issue (PO before approval): This violates the control mechanism... Second issue (payment before matching): Matching ensures that the invoice details... Case 1003 missing Release Payment: Without releasing payment, the vendor isn't paid... Case 1004's goods received before PO: This is impossible in a standard process... Therefore, these anomalies indicate potential issues with process controls, possible data entry errors, or system malfunctions that allow bypassing necessary steps."
