First, we note the key activities from the description: ReceiveApplication: This would be the initial step where the application is received (including resume and questionnaire). However, note that the description starts with Applicants first submit their resumes and are then prompted to fill out a detailed questionnaire, so we might consider the initial step as ReceiveApplication which includes both."

But the problem says: The final decision is then made, either approving the candidate for hire or rejecting them. We are modeling the process until the final decision. The ManagerialReview is a step that happens for all candidates? Or only for borderline? The description says borderline candidates, but the process as described seems to have ManagerialReview as a standard step after the cultural fit. Actually, step 4: Managerial Review & Final Decision is described as happening after the cultural fit step. So we assume that after the cultural fit step (whether standard or the community one), we go to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision."

Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check: ... 2. Preliminary Skill Assessment. So the data check (and loop) happens after the application is received and before the skill assessment. Therefore, the order is: ReceiveApplication -> * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ) -> SkillAssessment -> ..."
