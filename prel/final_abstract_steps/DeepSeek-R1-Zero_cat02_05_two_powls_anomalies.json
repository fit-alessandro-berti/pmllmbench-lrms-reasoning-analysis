Conduct interviews for the screened candidates.\n4. Make a hiring decision based on the interviews.\n5. Onboard the newly hired employee.\n6. Add the new employee to the payroll system.\n7.

The `Post -> Interview` connection makes it so that interviews can be conducted immediately after posting a job ad, which could be a waste of resources if candidates haven't been screened yet.\n2. The `loop_onboarding` operator allows for `Onboard_Employee` to be repeated multiple times until an exit is taken (via the silent transition). It might make sense for an onboarding process to involve multiple steps, but it seems unusual that the onboarding itself should be looped multiple times for a single new hire. Once the employee is onboarded, it should typically only be done once.\n3. The `xor_payroll` operator allows for skipping `Add_to_Payroll` entirely. However, once a new employee is onboarded, it is usually necessary to add them to the payroll. Skipping this step seems like a significant deviation from a standard \"Hire-to-Retire\" process."

    "Text": "Hence, a more appropriate and well-defined model should be structured such that:\n1. `Post_Job_Ad` should be followed by `Screen_Candidates`.\n2. `Screen_Candidates` should be followed by `Conduct_Interviews`.\n3. `Conduct_Interviews` should be followed by `Make_Hiring_Decision`.\n4. `Make_Hiring_Decision` should be followed by `Onboard_Employee`.\n5. `Onboard_Employee` should be followed by `Add_to_Payroll`.\n6. `Add_to_Payroll` should be followed by `Close_Case`.\n\nBased on that sequence, the main issue in model 1 is that `Interview` should be defined such that it comes before `Decide`, which seems like a less severe anomaly compared to the anomalies in model 2. \n\nHowever, another important part is that `Screen` should be before `Interview` which is true for model 1 but not for model 2 where `Post` is before both `Screen` and `Interview`, allowing `Interview` to be done before `Screen`.\n\nBased on the reasoning, Model 1 appears to be the one that closely aligns with a \"Hire-to-Retire\" process such that:\n1. `Post_Job_Ad` -> `Screen_Candidates` -> (`Conduct_Interviews` and `Make_Hiring_Decision` should be ordered such that `Interview` should be before `Decide`).\n2. `Make_Hiring_Decision` -> `Onboard_Employee` -> `Add_to_Payroll` -> `Close_Case`.\n    \nHowever, `Model 1` needs a slight modification such that:\n- An edge should be added from `Interview` to `Decide` to make sure `Make_Hiring_Decision` happens after `Conduct_Interviews`.\n\nThus, \"Model 1\" appears to make a more logical flow compared to model 2. However, it should be noted that both models need some adjustments to make a well-aligned \"Hire-to-Retire\" process.\n\nBased on the reasoning, the answer could be:\n**POWL Model 1 is more aligned with a normative \"Hire-to-Retire\" process. However, it should be adjusted to make sure that `Conduct_Interviews` happens before `Make_Hiring_Decision`.**\n\nHowever, another part that makes model 1 a bit more problematic is that there is no explicit order defined between `Interview` and `Decide`, so `Decide` could be executed before `Interview`, which is not logical. Another important part of the model is that `Onboard_Employee` should happen only once after a positive hiring decision has been made. \n\nThus, let us try to make a more structured reasoning:\n\n1) `Post_Job_Ad` should come first.\n2) `Screen_Candidates` should follow `Post_Job_Ad`.\n3) `Conduct_Interviews` should follow `Screen_Candidates`.\n4) `Make_Hiring_Decision` should follow `Conduct_Interviews`.\n5) `Onboard_Employee` should follow `Make_Hiring_Decision` only if the decision is to hire.\n6) `Add_to_Payroll` should follow `Onboard_Employee`.\n7) `Close_Case` should follow `Add_to_Payroll`.\n\nBased on this, the most logical order should be as follows:\n1. `Post_Job_Ad`  `Screen_Candidates`  `Conduct_Interviews`  `Make_Hiring_Decision`  `Onboard_Employee`  `Add_to_Payroll`  `Close_Case`.\n\nModel 1 seems to follow this order except for the part where `Interview` and `Decide` are not well ordered. The main issue here is that `Interview` and `Decide` both follow `Screen` concurrently which means that `Decide` could be done before `Interview`.\n\nModel 2 seems to make less sense because:\n1. `Post_Job_Ad` leads to both `Screen_Candidates` and `Conduct_Interviews` independently, so `Conduct_Interviews` could happen before `Screen_Candidates`.\n2. The `loop_onboarding` might make sense if there are several steps in the \"onboarding\" process, but it seems like `Onboard_Employee` could be repeated multiple times until a silent transition is taken.\n3. The `xor_payroll` allows for skipping `Add_to_Payroll` which seems a serious problem.\n\nThus, the most \"normative\" model should make sure that `Screen` should be before `Interview`, and `Interview` should be before `Decide`. \n\nBased on what appears to be a more \"normative\" process:\n1. Model 1 should be:\n`Post_Job_Ad` -> `Screen_Candidates` -> (`Conduct_Interviews` -> `Make_Hiring_Decision`) -> `Onboard_Employee` -> `Add_to_Payroll` -> `Close_Case`.\n\n2. Model 2 should be:\n`Post_Job_Ad` -> `Screen_Candidates` -> `Conduct_Interviews` -> `Make_Hiring_Decision` -> `Onboard_Employee` -> `Add_to_Payroll` -> `Close_Case`.\n\nSo, let us make a more explicit comparison here:\n\n1. **Model 1** has `Post_Job_Ad` -> `Screen_Candidates` -> (potentially parallel `Interview` and `Decide`) -> `Onboard_Employee` -> `Add_to_Payroll` -> `Close_Case`.\n\n2. **Model 2** has `Post_Job_Ad` -> (potentially parallel `Screen_Candidates` and `Interview`) -> `Make_Hiring_Decision` -> `loop (Onboard_Employee)` -> `XOR (Add_to_Payroll or skip)` -> `Close_Case`.\n\nBased on the detailed reasoning, **Model 1** seems to make more sense overall if `Interview` should be ordered such that it must be before `Decide`, which makes it a bit more logical than Model 2 where `Post_Job_Ad` directly leads to `Interview`, which is not a standard practice. \n\nThus, **POWL Model 1 is more aligned with a normative \"Hire-to-Retire\" process once an additional edge is added such that `Interview -> Decide`.**"
