So for example, SS to RC: the time from SS to RC would be the time from SS's end to RC's start, or the total time between their occurrence in the trace. So I need to think of the average time between any two activities where the first occurs before the second in a trace. For example, the pair (SS, DT) would have a time that's the sum of all the steps from SS to DT, but with some variance. But since the average and SD are given as the temporal distances between those two in the logs, I need to estimate for each pair."
