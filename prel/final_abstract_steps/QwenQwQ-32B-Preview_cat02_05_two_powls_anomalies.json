    "Text": "In summary Model 1 is better because  It maintains a logical sequence from posting to screening to decision making  The only anomaly is the parallel execution of deciding and interviewing from screening which is a lesser deviation compared to the issues in Model 2 Model 2 is worse because  It allows screening and interviewing to happen in parallel after posting the ad  It includes a loop on onboarding which doesnt make sense in this context  It has an exclusive choice that allows skipping payroll addition which is a critical step in hiring"
