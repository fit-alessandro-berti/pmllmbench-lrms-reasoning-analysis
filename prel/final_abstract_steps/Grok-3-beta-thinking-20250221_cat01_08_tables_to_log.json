The prompt says to use the order_id as the case identifier, so each unique order_id will represent a separate case in the event log. That makes sense because each order goes through a series of activities from creation to payment."

So, for each row in the Orders table, I can create an event with Activity Name Order Created, Timestamp as order_date, and Case ID as order_id. Additionally, since theres a sales_person_id, I can include the Resource/Actor as the sales person who created the order."

    "Text": "Next, Items Picked from the Order Lines table. The Order Lines table has multiple rows per order, each with an item_id, quantity, item_picking_date, and picker_id. So, for each item in an order, there is a picking event with a specific timestamp and the picker who did it. Now, I need to decide how to represent this in the event log. One option is to have a separate event for each item picked... Alternatively, I could try to summarize the picking activity for the entire order, but since each item might be picked at different times by different pickers, it might be more accurate to have separate events for each item... I think Ill go with having separate Item Picked events for each item in the order."

Importantly, an order can have multiple deliveries, as seen for order 1002... So, for each delivery record, I should create two events: one for Order Dispatched with timestamp delivery_dispatch_date, and one for Order Arrived with timestamp delivery_arrival_date... However, since an order can have multiple deliveries... it makes sense to have separate events for each delivery."

So, for each row in the Invoice table, Ill create an event Invoice Issued with timestamp invoice_issue_date, Case ID as order_id, and Resource/Actor as the billing_person_id."

    "Text": "Finally, the Payment Received event from the Payments table. The Payments table has payment_date, payment_method, and payment_reference, linked to an invoice_id. Since invoices are linked to orders, I can trace back to the order_id... So, for each row in the Payments table, Ill create an event Payment Received with timestamp payment_date, Case ID as the corresponding order_id from the Invoice table."
