One option is to have a separate event for each item picked, so if an order has multiple items, there would be multiple \"Item Picked\" events, each with its own timestamp and picker.\n\nAlternatively, I could try to summarize the picking activity for the entire order, but since each item might be picked at different times by different pickers, it might be more accurate to have separate events for each item.\n\nWait, but in process mining, typically, we want to capture the sequence of activities, and if picking different items happens at different times, those are distinct events.\n\nMoreover, the prompt says: \"When multiple timestamps are available (e.g., item_picking_date for multiple items), produce one event per activity if itâ€™s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate.\""
