Case 103: Receive Ticket 2024-03-01 08:10 Resolve Ticket 2024-03-01 09:15 Resolution time 1 hour 5 minutes approx 1.083 hours. Case 104: Receive Ticket 2024-03-01 08:20 Resolve Ticket 2024-03-02 08:00 Resolution time From 08:20 on 2024-03-01 to 08:00 on 2024-03-02 23 hours 40 minutes approx 23.67 hours.

Now lets list the resolution times in hours: Case 101 2 hours Case 102 25 hours Case 103 ~1.08 hours Case 104 ~23.67 hours Case 105 ~48.58 hours."

    "Text": "We can see that Cases 102 104 and 105 are taking much longer than the average. The average resolution time is 2 + 25 + 1.08 + 23.67 + 48.58 / 5 = 100.33 / 5 = 20.066 hours. So Cases 102 104 and 105 are above average but we are looking for significantly longer. Looking at the distribution Cases 101 and 103 are very quick around 1-2 hours. Cases 102 104 and 105 are taking 25 24 and 48 hours respectively. So all three are significantly longer."

    "Text": "Now lets identify patterns 1. Escalations Cases 102 105 had escalations. Case 104 did not. But Case 104 also had a long resolution time. So escalation is a factor but not the only one. 2. Long waiting times - Case 102 After assignment 2.5 hours wait before escalation. After escalation 2.5 hours wait before investigation started. Then investigation took 19 hours. - Case 104 After assignment 3.5 hours wait before investigation started. Then investigation took 19 hours. - Case 105 After escalation 28 hours wait before the Level-2 agent started investigation. Then investigation took 19 hours. 3. Unnecessary delays - In Case 102 why did they wait 2.5 hours after assignment to escalate - In Case 104 why did they wait 3.5 hours after assignment to start investigation - In Case 105 why did they wait 28 hours after escalation to start the investigation by Level-2 Also note that in Cases 102 104 and 105 the investigation step itself took a long time 19 hours."

    "Text": "Potential root causes - Escalations Cases that escalate take longer. However the process after escalation seems to have long delays waiting for Level-2 agent to start and then long investigation times. - Resource unavailability - In Case 102 After escalation the Level-2 agent started investigation only after 2.5 hours. That might be because the Level-2 agent was busy - In Case 105 The Level-2 agent started investigation after 28 hours. That is a very long wait. It could be that the Level-2 agent was not available or the ticket was not prioritized. - Long investigation times The investigation step in the delayed cases took 19 hours. This could be due to the complexity of the issue but also might be because the agent did not work on it continuously. - Delays between steps There are significant waiting times between activities."

    "Text": "Proposed insights and recommendations 1. Escalation handling The process after escalation seems to have long delays. We should ensure that when a ticket is escalated it is immediately assigned to an available Level-2 agent. In Case 105 the wait was 28 hours. This is unacceptable. We need to set a service level agreement SLA for escalation response time. 2. Resource allocation The long waits might be due to unavailability of agents. We should monitor the workload of agents and ensure that there is enough coverage especially for Level-2 agents. 3. Investigation time The long investigation times 19 hours might be due to complex issues but also might be due to inefficiencies. We should analyze what kind of issues take so long. 4. Process optimization In Case 104 there was a 3.5-hour wait after assignment before investigation. We should ensure that once a ticket is assigned the agent starts working on it immediately. 5. Monitoring and alerts We should monitor the time between steps and set alerts if a ticket is waiting too long at any step. 6. Training and tools The long investigation times might be reduced by better training of Level-1 agents so that they can handle more complex issues without escalation."
