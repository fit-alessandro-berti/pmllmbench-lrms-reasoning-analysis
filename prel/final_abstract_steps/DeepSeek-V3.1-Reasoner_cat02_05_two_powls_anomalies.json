Typically, it involves posting a job ad, screening candidates, conducting interviews, making a hiring decision, onboarding the new employee, adding them to payroll, and closing the case. The activities should happen in a logical sequence, with some dependencies: for example, you cant screen candidates before posting a job ad, and you cant onboard without a hiring decision."

Since Screen must happen before both, but after Screen, Interview and Decide can happen in any order or concurrently? In a partial order, if theres no path between two nodes, they might be concurrent or in any order, but we need to see the dependencies. From the edges, Screen is before both Decide and Interview, but Decide and Interview have no direct order. This means that after screening, the process can conduct interviews and make the hiring decision in any order. But logically, making a hiring decision should come after interviews because interviews inform the decision. So, having no order between Interview and Decide is an anomaly. It might allow making a decision before interviews, which doesnt make sense."

So, this loop might allow multiple onboardings or skipping onboarding, which might not be desirable. Onboarding should happen once for a new hire, but sometimes if there are issues, maybe multiple onboardings? But typically, it should be done once."

In Model 1, if we ignore the lack of order between Interview and Decide, it almost has the sequence, but the disorder between Interview and Decide is a problem. In Model 2, the disorders are more severe: Screen and Interview are not ordered, and payroll can be skipped. But lets see the edges in Model 2: Post before Screen and Post before Interview, but no edge between Screen and Interview, so they are concurrent or in any order. Similarly, in Model 1, Screen before Decide and Screen before Interview, but no edge between Interview and Decide. In Model 2, Interview before Decide, which is good, but Screen and Interview are not ordered. Also, in Model 2, Post is directly connected to Interview, which might imply that interviews can start immediately after posting, without screening, which is inefficient and illogical."

    "Text": "Now, for the loop_onboarding: it might allow repeating onboarding, which could be useful if onboarding involves multiple steps, but typically, onboarding is a single activity or a sub-process, but looping might not be necessary. However, skipping onboarding via the loop? The loop has Onboard and skip, so after Decide, you go to loop_onboarding, which means you execute Onboard, then you have a choice: either exit the loop or execute skip and then go back to Onboard? But since skip is silent, it might mean that you can skip onboarding altogether by choosing to exit after Onboard? Lets think about how loop works. In POWL, a loop operator between two sub-models, e.g., *(A,B), means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So here, loop_onboarding = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[Onboard, skip]). So, it means first execute Onboard, then either exit or execute skip and then go back to Onboard. But skip does nothing, so effectively, after onboarding, you can either stop or do nothing and then onboard again? That doesnt make much sense. It might allow multiple onboardings, but not skipping onboarding initially. To skip onboarding, you would need to have an option to not do Onboard at all, but in this loop, the first thing is to execute Onboard, so onboarding always happens at least once? Lets see the order: Decide before loop_onboarding, so after decision, you always start with Onboard. Then after Onboard, you have a choice: exit the loop (so proceed to xor_payroll) or execute skip and then repeat Onboard. So, onboarding is always performed at least once, which is good, but then you might do skip and then onboard again, which means multiple onboardings? That might be unnecessary but not terrible. However, skip is silent, so it doesnt add value, but it might allow looping without reason. But in terms of process, onboarding should be done once, so looping might be an anomaly but less severe if it doesnt skip onboarding."

    "Text": "So in Model 2, the worst anomaly is that payroll can be skipped. Also, the disorder between Screen and Interview is bad. Now, back to Model 1: in Model 1, after Screen, both Interview and Decide can be done in any order. But Decide should be after Interview, so if Decide is done before Interview, that would be wrong. But in Model 1, is there any constraint? Since Screen is before both, but no order between them, so yes, Decide can be before Interview. However, in Model 1, from the edges, Screen must be before Decide and before Interview, so Interview and Decide are both after Screen, but they are not ordered with each other, so either can happen first. But in practice, if Decide happens before Interview, that means making hiring decision without interviews, which is possible if you hire based on screening only, but for most jobs, interviews are necessary. So, it might be a deviation, but perhaps not as severe as skipping payroll."

    "Text": "Skipping payroll means the employee doesnt get paid, which is a critical issue. In Model 2, payroll can be skipped, which is very bad. Also, in Model 2, interviews might happen before screening, which means interviewing candidates without screening, which could waste time on unqualified candidates, so its inefficient but not as bad as skipping payroll. So, overall, Model 1 has one anomaly: no order between Interview and Decide, which might allow decision before interviews. Model 2 has multiple anomalies: no order between Screen and Interview (so interviews before screening), looping onboarding (which might be okay if controlled, but here it might allow multiple onboardings), and skipping payroll (which is critical). Therefore, Model 1 is closer to normative because it doesnt have any critical anomalies like skipping payroll. The disorder in Model 1 between Interview and Decide is less severe than skipping payroll. Thus, Model 1 is better because it ensures that onboarding and payroll are done, whereas Model 2 allows skipping payroll. The disorder in Model 1 between Interview and Decide is less severe than skipping payroll."
