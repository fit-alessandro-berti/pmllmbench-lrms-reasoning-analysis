After that, components are shipped to Malaysia for assembly, followed by quality checks, packing, and then shipping via air or sea. Then there's customs clearance, distribution centers, local logistics, inventory monitoring, and a loop back to adjust orders or proceed."

Are there risks like geopolitical issues or supply chain disruptions? How are these mitigated? Also, why split into four separate tasks? Maybe to parallelize the process for efficiency, but what if one component is delayed?"

What factors determine the decision to use parallel gateways for securing components? 4. What contingency plans exist if a critical component supplier faces disruptions? 5. How are the assembly plant's 24/7 operations managed to prevent equipment downtime or labor issues? 6. What criteria are used to determine pass/fail in quality checks, and how are these thresholds established? 7. How does the company balance cost and speed when choosing between air and sea freight? 8. What strategies ensure customs compliance across different regional markets? 9. How is inventory turnover monitored, and what triggers adjustments in supplier orders? 10. What performance metrics are tracked at each stage of the supply chain? 11. How are regional distribution centers coordinated to ensure consistent service levels? 12. What communication protocols exist between the assembly plant and component suppliers? 13. How is feedback from quality checks integrated into the R&D or assembly processes? 14. What role does stakeholder input play in deciding between rework and scrapping defective units? 15. How might emerging technologies like blockchain improve component tracking? 16. What impact could a shift to nearshoring have on the current supply chain model? 17. How are environmental or regulatory changes in host countries addressed? 18. What mechanisms ensure that sales forecasts align with actual market demand? 19. How are conflicts resolved when different regions have competing distribution priorities? 20. What benchmarks are used to evaluate the efficiency of the assembly process?"
