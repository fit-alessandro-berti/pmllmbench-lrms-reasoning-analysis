The JOIN with a CTE might be more efficient because the CTE is computed once and then we do a join. However, note that the IN subquery might also be optimized to a semi-join by the query planner. Since the problem does not specify the size of the data, we can choose either. Let's go with the IN subquery for simplicity."

This might be less efficient because it has to compute the window function for every row, whereas the GROUP BY in the other methods only computes per case."

    "Text": "In any case, let's stick with the IN subquery for clarity and because it is straightforward. However, note: the problem says filter out any cases containing more than six events, and we are returning events from cases with six or fewer. Let me write the query with the IN subquery. But wait: what if there are NULL case_ids? The problem says each row representing a single event and each case_id groups events, so we assume case_id is not NULL. But if there are NULLs, then the GROUP BY would put them in one group and the IN would include NULL? Actually, in SQL, NULL in an IN clause is tricky. For example, if there is a NULL case_id, then the condition case_id IN ( ... ) would not match because NULL is not equal to any value, including NULL. So if we have NULL case_ids, they would be excluded. However, the problem does not specify whether case_id can be NULL. Since it's a grouping column, we assume it's non-NULL. If we want to be safe, we might need to consider NULLs, but the problem does not specify. Let's assume case_id is non-NULL."

So the query should return only the two events of case 1. Let's run the subquery for the IN:   For case_id 1: count=2 -> included.   For case_id 2: count=7 -> excluded. So the main query returns only case 1 events. This meets the requirement. However, note: the problem says six or fewer, so 0,1,2,3,4,5,6. But if a case has 0 events, it wouldn't be in the event_log at all. So we don't have to worry about 0. So the query is: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN (   SELECT case_id   FROM event_log   GROUP BY case_id   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ); But wait, what if we have a case with 0 events? It's not in the log, so it's not selected. So it's fine."

    "Text": "We can also use a common table expression (CTE) for better readability, but the above is concise. I think this is acceptable. Let me also consider performance: if the event_log is very large, we might want to avoid the IN subquery because it might not be the most efficient. Alternatively, we can use a join: WITH eligible_cases AS (   SELECT case_id   FROM event_log   GROUP BY case_id   HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e JOIN eligible_cases c ON e.case_id = c.case_id; This might be more efficient because the join can be optimized (e.g., hash join) and the CTE is computed only once. But again, for the purpose of this prompt, both are acceptable. I will choose the IN version for its simplicity and because it is a single query without CTE. However, note that some SQL dialects might have performance issues with IN and large subqueries, but DuckDB is designed for analytics and should handle it well."
