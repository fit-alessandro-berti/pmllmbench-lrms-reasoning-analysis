The JOIN with a CTE might be more efficient because the CTE is computed once and then we do a join. However, note that the IN subquery might also be optimized to a semi-join by the query planner. Since the problem does not specify the size of the data, we can choose either. Let's go with the IN subquery for simplicity."

But if there are NULLs, then the GROUP BY would put them in one group and the IN would include NULL? Actually, in SQL, NULL in an IN clause is tricky. For example, if there is a NULL case_id, then the condition case_id IN ( ... ) would not match because NULL is not equal to any value, including NULL. So if we have NULL case_ids, they would be excluded."

So the query should return only the two events of case 1. Let's run the subquery for the IN: For case_id 1: count=2 -> included. For case_id 2: count=7 -> excluded. So the main query returns only case 1 events. This meets the requirement."
