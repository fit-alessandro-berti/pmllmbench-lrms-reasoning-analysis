Wait, the description says: \"execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again\". So the loop is A followed by either exiting or doing B then A again.

So each iteration is AS followed by IQC, then you can choose to loop again (execute IQC followed by AS again?), but I need to get the exact structure right. Alternatively, perhaps the loop is structured such that after AS, you do IQC. If the loop condition is met, you go back to AS again. So the loop operator would have A as AS, and B as IQC. Because after AS (A), you can choose to exit, or do IQC (B) and then back to AS again. So the loop would be * (AS, IQC). Each time you choose to loop, you do B (IQC) followed by A (AS). So the loop would be: AS (A) -> ( do B (IQC) -> A (AS) ) as many times as needed, then exit."
