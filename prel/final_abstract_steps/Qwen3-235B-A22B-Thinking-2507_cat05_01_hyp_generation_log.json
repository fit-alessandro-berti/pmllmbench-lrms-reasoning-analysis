Check for duplicate activities: Some activities might be repeated when they shouldnt be (though sometimes repetition might be valid, but in this strict flow, duplicates might indicate an anomaly). 4. Check for activities performed by the wrong resource (role/department): We have the resources table that maps resource_id to role and department. We can check if the resource performing an activity is from the expected department."

    "Text": "Hypotheses for anomalies: Case 1002: - Hypothesis 1: The order was shipped prematurely because the credit check and stock validation were skipped due to a system error or manual override. - Hypothesis 2: The sales team might have rushed the shipment to meet a deadline, bypassing necessary checks. Case 1003: - Hypothesis 1: The warehouse clerk might have shipped the goods without confirming stock and shipment, possibly due to a miscommunication or error. - Hypothesis 2: The system might have allowed the shipment activity to be recorded without the preceding steps, indicating a flaw in the process enforcement. Case 1004: - Hypothesis 1: The payment was received before the order was processed because it was a prepayment, but the system recorded it as part of the order process. However, the normal flow does not include prepayment as an early step. - Hypothesis 2: There might be a data entry error where the payment event was timestamped incorrectly. Additionally, we note: - In Case 1004, the payment is received before the invoice is issued. This is a violation of the normal flow (which expects invoice before payment)."

    "Text": "Proposed SQL queries to investigate: 1. Find cases with missing activities (i.e., cases that do not have all 7 expected activities). We can count the distinct activities per case and compare to 7. 2. Find cases with out-of-order activities. We can assign a sequence number to each activity in the expected order and then check if the timestamps are increasing in that sequence. 3. Check for activities performed by the wrong resource. We have the resources table that maps resource_id to role and department. We can create a mapping of activity to expected department. 4. Additionally, we might want to check for duplicate activities (if an activity appears more than once in a case, which might be an anomaly in this strict flow). 5. For Case 1004, we saw payment received before invoice. We can specifically check for cases where Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice. 6. Similarly, we can check for shipment before credit check or stock validation."

    "Text": "Note: In Query 2, we might also want to consider missing steps (i.e., if an activity is missing, then the step numbers might jump). However, the query as written will show non-increasing steps, which includes both out-of-order and missing steps (because if a step is missing, the next step might have a higher step number but the actual sequence might be non-monotonic? Actually, the step numbers are assigned by the expected order, so if step 3 is missing, then step 4 might come right after step 2, and 4>2 so it would not be caught by the condition step <= prev_step. Therefore, Query 2 as written might not catch missing steps. But Query 1 is for missing steps. However, note: the condition in Query 2 is for when the step number of the current event is not greater than the previous event. This will catch: - Events that are out of order (e.g., step 4 then step 3) -> step=3 <= prev_step=4 -> caught. - But if a step is missing, then we might have step 2 then step 4: 4>2 -> not caught. So Query 2 is specifically for out-of-order (non-monotonic increasing) events, not for missing events. Therefore, we have two separate issues: missing events (Query 1) and out-of-order events (Query 2). We can also extend Query 2 to catch when the step number jumps by more than 1? But that might be acceptable in some processes (if a step is skipped but the process allows it). However, in our strict flow, skipping a step is an anomaly and is covered by Query 1. So well keep them separate."
