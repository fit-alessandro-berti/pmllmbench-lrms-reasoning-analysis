Check for out-of-order activities: The activities should occur in the sequence above. If an activity occurs before a prerequisite, that's an anomaly. 3. Check for duplicate activities: Some activities might be repeated when they shouldn't be (though sometimes repetition might be valid, but in this strict flow, duplicates might indicate an anomaly). 4. Check for activities performed by the wrong resource (role/department): We have the resources table that maps resource_id to role and department. We can check if the resource performing an activity is from the expected department."

Anomaly: The sequence is broken: Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods occur before Credit Check and Validate Stock. Case 1003: ... Anomaly: Ship Goods occurs before Validate Stock and Confirm Shipment. Confirm Shipment occurs after Ship Goods. Case 1004: ... Anomaly: Receive Payment before Issue Invoice and even before shipment activities. Issue Invoice after Receive Payment."

    "Text": "Hypotheses for anomalies: Case 1002: Hypothesis 1: The order was shipped prematurely because the credit check and stock validation were skipped due to a system error or manual override. Hypothesis 2: The sales team might have rushed the shipment to meet a deadline, bypassing necessary checks. Case 1003: Hypothesis 1: The warehouse clerk might have shipped the goods without confirming stock and shipment, possibly due to a miscommunication or error. Hypothesis 2: The system might have allowed the shipment activity to be recorded without the preceding steps, indicating a flaw in the process enforcement. Case 1004: Hypothesis 1: The payment was received before the order was processed because it was a prepayment, but the system recorded it as part of the order process. However, the normal flow does not include prepayment as an early step. Hypothesis 2: There might be a data entry error where the payment event was timestamped incorrectly."

    "Text": "Proposed SQL queries to investigate: 1. Find cases with missing activities (i.e., cases that do not have all 7 expected activities). 2. Find cases with out-of-order activities. 3. Check for activities performed by the wrong resource. 4. Additionally, we might want to check for duplicate activities (if an activity appears more than once in a case, which might be an anomaly in this strict flow). 5. For Case 1004, we saw payment received before invoice. We can specifically check for cases where Receive Payment occurs before Issue Invoice. 6. Similarly, we can check for shipment before credit check or stock validation."

    "Text": "However, a better way: for each case, we can get the sequence of activities and then check if it matches the expected sequence. We can do: ... We can compare the step with the previous step in the actual sequence. ... This will show events where the current step is not greater than the previous step (i.e., out of order). Alternatively, we can find cases where the step numbers are not in increasing order: ... However, note: the condition in Query 2 is for when the step number of the current event is not greater than the previous event. This will catch: - Events that are out of order (e.g., step 4 then step 3) -> step=3 <= prev_step=4 -> caught. - But if a step is missing, then we might have step 2 then step 4: 4>2 -> not caught. So Query 2 is specifically for out-of-order (non-monotonic increasing) events, not for missing events. Therefore, we have two separate issues: missing events (Query 1) and out-of-order events (Query 2)."
