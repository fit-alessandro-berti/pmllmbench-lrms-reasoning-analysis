The loop is entered only if results are abnormal... implies theres a choice point after the initial diagnostic test: - If normal: skip the loop - If abnormal: enter the loop But the process tree operators given are: ->, X, +, * Theres no explicit if-then-else operator. However, we can model this using the XOR operator with a silent step (tau) for the normal results path.
