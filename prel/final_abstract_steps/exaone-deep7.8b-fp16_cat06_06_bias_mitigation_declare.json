So maybe add a \"coexistence\" constraint that links the decision activity to ManualReview when the decision is made on a sensitive group. But how do we model the sensitive group? Since the model uses activities, perhaps we need to introduce a new activity representing the disclosure of the sensitive attribute, like CheckApplicantRace, and then link the decision to ManualReview only when that check occurs."

To model that, perhaps add a \"response\" constraint between Check and ManualReview, and between ManualReview and Decision. This way, whenever the Check is present, the ManualReview must be in between, leading to the Decision. This would ensure that if a Decision is made after a Check, the ManualReview is in between.

For example, the user mentioned: \"Response or Succession Constraints: Ensure that certain decision steps (Approve, Reject) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) without first performing a BiasMitigationCheck.\"\nSo, if an activity like CheckApplicantRace is followed by a decision (Reject), that's not allowed unless there's a BiasMitigationCheck in between. To model this, perhaps add a \"response\" constraint between CheckApplicantRace and BiasMitigationCheck, and another between BiasMitigationCheck and the decision."

To model this, add a \"non-succession\" constraint between CheckApplicantRace and Reject. The \"non-succession\" key in the example is present but empty. So adding a \"non-succession\": {\"CheckApplicantRace\": {\"Reject\": {}}} would prevent them from being consecutive."
