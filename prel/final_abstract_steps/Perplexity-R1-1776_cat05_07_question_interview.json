    "Text": "First, the process starts when a landlord contacts the regional office. The property coordinator checks the documents. If something's missing, they ask for updates. Then they enter property details into the database. Next, they assign a property manager based on workload, geography, experience, and track record. Then there's an intro meeting between manager and landlord. After that, they schedule a photographer and inspector. If issues are found, they fix them. Marketing materials are created once inspection passes. Then the property is activated, tenant screening happens, lease is finalized, and then quality checks and audits happen."
