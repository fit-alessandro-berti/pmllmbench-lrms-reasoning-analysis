    "Text": "Now for the second part desiderata Case 1 All activities are timely and within the recommended windows They also included a followup call so no issues here Case 2 The Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment which is a normative issue but lets see desiderata The timestamps are 800 820 900 etc The Credit Check was done 1 hour after Risk Assessment but since the order was wrong its not about timing They might have done it quickly but the main issue is the sequence So desideratawise maybe checking if any timing recommendations were violated It seems they did the Credit Check relatively quickly after the application 800 to 900 but since the order was wrong I think the desiderata here is about the promptness but the main issue is the normative Maybe they didnt violate desiderata timing but the main issue is the normative Wait in Case 2 the Credit Check was done 1 hour after Risk Assessment The application was received at 800 Risk Assessment at 820 Credit Check at 900 So the Credit Check was done after but the order was wrong The desiderata says Credit Check should be done promptly after application which they didnt do because they did Risk Assessment first But actually the Credit Check was done the same day so maybe within the 24 hours So perhaps the timing is still okay but the order is not So for desiderata maybe they didnt violate the timing but the order is the normative issue Wait the desiderata is about timing not about order So in Case 2 the Credit Check was done within 24 hours so thats fine The Loan Decision was done 930 which is same day Informing the applicant was done 1000 same day which is within 48 hours So maybe the timing is okay but the order is wrong So for desiderata maybe only the Followup Call is missing But in the event log theres no mention of a Followup Call for Case 2 either So they missed that which is a desideratum Wait in the problem statement the event logs are given Case 2 has no Followup Call same as Case 3 So perhaps both Case 2 and 3 missed the Followup Call Wait in the description the event log for Case 3 doesnt have a Followup Call but its not specified for Case 2 So perhaps both Case 2 and 3 missed the Followup Call So for desiderata both Case 2 and 3 have missing Followup Calls But in Case 2 the other timing recommendations were met The Credit Check was done next day at 800 but the application was received at 800 so same day as Risk Assessment and Credit Check but the order was wrong So the timing for Credit Check was same day so within 24 hours so no desideratum violation there The Loan Decision was same day and Inform Applicant was same day so within 48 hours So only desideratum violations in Case 2 are the missing Followup Call In Case 3 the Credit Check was done 2 days later which is beyond 24 hours so violates desiderata The Inform Applicant was done 2 days after Loan Decision which is beyond 48 hours so another violation Also no Followup Call"

    "Text": "So summarizing Normative violations Case 2 Risk Assessment before Credit Check Finalize Documentation after Rejection Case 3 No normative violations Desiderata violations Case 1 No issues Case 2 Missing Followup Call Case 3 Late Credit Check late Inform Applicant missing Followup Call Now for the interpretations Case 2 Maybe the staff wasnt following the correct procedure perhaps due to urgency or oversight They might have started with Risk Assessment without realizing the Credit Check was pending After the rejection they might have mistakenly tried to finalize documentation perhaps due to a system error or misunderstanding Case 3 The delay in Credit Check could be due to high volume or resource constraints Similarly the delay in informing the applicant might be due to backlogs or priority of cases The missing Followup Call could be an oversight or not a priority in their process I think that covers it"
