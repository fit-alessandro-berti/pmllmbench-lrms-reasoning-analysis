Step 1: Calculate the number of events per case_id. That would be a SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as event_count FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id. Then filter where event_count <=6. Then get those case_ids. Then, step 2: Take those case_ids and select all rows from event_log where case_id is in that list."

But the problem says to return the full set of events, which implies the original columns. So including the event_count might be considered as including extra data. Therefore, the first approach is better because it doesnt add extra columns."

In the subquery, case 2 is excluded. So the main query returns only case 1s events. Correct. Another case: a case with exactly 6 events. It should be included. Yes, the HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 includes counts of 6 or fewer. So the query is correct."
