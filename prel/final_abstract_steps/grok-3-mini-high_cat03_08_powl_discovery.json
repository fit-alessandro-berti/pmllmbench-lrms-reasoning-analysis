For example, in Case 1: AS  IQC  AS, in Case 3: IQC  IQC  AS  IQC  AS, etc. It seems like after initial activities, there's a loop involving assembly and quality checks until some condition is met.\n2. **Loop in TST and RT:** RT indicates re-testing, which loops back to TST. Seen in Case 1,3,5 where RT is followed by TST again.\n3. **Choice for LB:** Labeling can be skipped, as in Case 2. So there's an exclusive choice: do LB or skip it.\n4. **Some cases skip IQC altogether:** Like Case 4, which goes directly from AS to TST. So perhaps IQC is optional or part of a loop that might not be entered."

But RT might be part of the loop.\nIn standard loop representation, for a retry loop, it could be modeled as * (TST, RT), meaning do TST, then either exit (if pass) or do RT and then TST again."
