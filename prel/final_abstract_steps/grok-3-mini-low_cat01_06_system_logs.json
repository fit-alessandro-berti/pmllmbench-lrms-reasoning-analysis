Looking at the log, it seems like the user is switching between different documents and applications, but there might be a logical sequence. For example, editing Document1.docx, then handling an email, then reviewing a PDF, and so on. I need to infer cases based on the document or task being worked on. A simple approach: Treat each document or major task as a case. So: Case for Quarterly_Report.docx, Case for Document1.docx, Case for Email handling, Case for Report_Draft.pdf, Case for Budget_2024.xlsx."
