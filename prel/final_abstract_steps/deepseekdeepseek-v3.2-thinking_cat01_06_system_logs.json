We can skip the SWITCH events and only consider the events that are directly about the case. Alternatively, we can map the SWITCH event to the case of the target application. Lets reconsider: We want to capture the process of working on a document. The SWITCH event marks the point where the user leaves one document and starts another. Given the time, lets stick to the original plan of ignoring SWITCH events"
