The process is multinational, involving different countries for suppliers and manufacturing, as well as logistics and distribution. So, the user wants 20 open ended questions that cover various aspects of this supply chain."

    "Text": "Starting with the suppliers: Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, US. Maybe ask about the quality of components and how that affects the final product. Then, the assembly in Malaysia how does their schedule affect production? Also, the transportation to different regions and the role of logistics in customs and compliance."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Next, the inventory management and forecasting. The question about data analytics and machine learning models could be a good one. Then, the quality assurance protocols and compliance with regulations. Also, the warranty and after sales support."

Quality assurance, compliance, warranty, after sales support. Implications of decisions, time zones, currencies."

Transportation to regions... 4. Inventory and forecasting... 5. Quality protocols... 6. Comply with regulations... 7. Warranty and after sales... 8. Implications of decisions... 9. Time zones... 10. Currencies... 11. Data analytics... 12. Machine learning... 13. Potential issues... 14. Strategies for improvement... 15. Implications... 16. Time zones... 17. Currencies... 18. Data analytics... 19.
