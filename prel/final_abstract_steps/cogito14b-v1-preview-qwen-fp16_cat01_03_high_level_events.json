    "Text": "Looking at Case A1 and B2, both follow a similar sequence of activities. Let me list out the events for one case (A1) and see how they flow: 1. Retrieve raw metal sheet 2. Scan barcode 3. Place metal sheet on table 4. Align metal sheet 5. Preheat metal sheet Then theres picking up welding tools, followed by welding corners A and B. After that comes measuring weld integrity, applying a protective coating, drying it, and finally a visual check."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the sequence seems to start with material preparation (steps 1-5), then assembly or welding (6-8), quality checks (9-10), and finishing steps (11-12)."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should group these based on their purpose. For example, steps related to preparing the metal sheet before any processing would be one high-level step. Then the actual welding operations would be another. Quality checks after assembly make sense as a third step, and coating/drying/visual check as the final steps."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I need to ensure that the groupings make sense across both cases (A1 and B2). The sequences are identical in structure, so this grouping should hold. Each high-level step involves a distinct phase of the manufacturing process, performed by different resources (operators, robots, sensors), which supports their separation."
