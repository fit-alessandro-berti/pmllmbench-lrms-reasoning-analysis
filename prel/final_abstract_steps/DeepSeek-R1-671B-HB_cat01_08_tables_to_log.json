However, the output example in the prompt might just use IDs. Let me check the Resources Table. It has resource_id and resource_name. So maybe in the event log, the Actor should be the resource_name. For example, SP-001 becomes Alice Brown. But the user might prefer to keep the IDs for brevity. The problem statement says to \"enrich with resources and attributes if available\". So maybe the resource column should include the actor's name. Hmm, but the example given in the prompt's task 2 shows \"Items Picked\" events with picker_id from the Order Lines table. So for those, the actor would be the picker_id, which is from the warehouse staff. So we need to map the picker_id to the resource_name from the Resources Table.

For process mining, having individual events for each item picked might be useful to see parallel activities or delays. But if the user prefers to summarize, maybe have a single \"Items Picked\" event per order, using the latest item_picking_date. However, the example in task 2 shows \"Items Picked\" event(s) as plural, so maybe each item picking is an event. So for order 1001, there are two items picked at different times, so two \"Item Picked\" events. Each with their own timestamp and picker. Then, the Activity Name could be \"Item Picked - ITEM-001\" or just \"Item Picked\" with the item_id as an attribute. The problem says \"Derive Activities: Convert key steps...\", so maybe the Activity Name is generic like \"Item Picked\", and include item_id in Other Attributes.\n\nThen, for each order line, create an event \"Item Picked\" with the timestamp as item_picking_date, resource as picker_id (mapped to name)."

So there's a problem here. The order 1004 has an entry in the Order Lines Table (item ITEM-001, quantity 5, picked on 2024-01-06) but no Delivery record. So according to the data, this order has been picked but not delivered. Similarly, there's no Invoice or Payment entries for order 1004. Let me check the Invoice and Payments tables.\n\nInvoice Table: order 1004 is not present. So order 1004 has been created, items picked, but no delivery, invoice, or payment. So in the event log, order 1004 would have Order Created and Item Picked events but no further steps. Is this possible? The problem says \"Ensure that every event for every order_id is included\". So we must include the existing events for order 1004, even if delivery, invoice, and payment are missing.
