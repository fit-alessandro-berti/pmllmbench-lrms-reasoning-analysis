If the system or underwriters are more likely to choose D for certain groups, giving them that uplift, but not for others, that's a bias. Alternatively, maybe the check in D has a hidden bias.

Therefore, if a group is more often sent through D, they get the uplift, which is better. So if the non-legally protected group is more likely to go through D (thus getting the uplift), they have an advantage over protected groups who might skip D and not get that boost.
