The Protected Group is probably a group that's legally protected from discrimination, like race, gender, etc., while Unprotected might not have those protections. But here, looking at the data, Group A has LocalResident as FALSE and CommunityGroup as None, while Group B has LocalResident as TRUE and sometimes CommunityGroup like Highland Civic Darts Club."

Even though both groups have similar approval rates in the sample, the reason for approvals/rejections might be based on irrelevant factors."
