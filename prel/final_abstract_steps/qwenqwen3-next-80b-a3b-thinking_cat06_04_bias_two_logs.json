Wait, the problem says Group A is Protected and Group B is Unprotected. But usually, Protected Groups are those with characteristics that are protected by law (like race, gender, etc.), so maybe in this context, Protected Group is the one that should be treated fairly, but maybe there's bias against them."

Group B: U001: 730 Approved (threshold met) U002:710 Rejected (below threshold) U003:705 Approved? Wait, but 705 is below 715, so why approved? Unless the threshold is 700.

So if the system is giving a +10 boost for being in Highland Civic Darts Club, which is a community group that is part of the Unprotected Group (since Group A is non-local and perhaps can't join), then this could be a form of bias because it's giving extra points for an irrelevant factor that only benefits the Unprotected Group."
