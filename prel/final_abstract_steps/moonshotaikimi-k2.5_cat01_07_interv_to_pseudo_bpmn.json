After logging it, I forward it to the purchasing department to confirm that the goods or services were actually received. Once I get confirmation, I match the invoice line items against the PO in the system."

This suggests: - Task: Check for PO - If No: Task: Request PO Details from Supplier (loop) So the No PO path has two possibilities: 1. Send back to supplier to add PO (loop) 2. Escalate to Supervisor for retrospective PO creation"

    "Text": "**Variations/Ambiguities Identified:** 1. **Missing PO Handling**: Some interviewees describe returning invoices to suppliers for PO addition; others describe creating retrospective POs via the Supervisor for informal contracts. 2. **Discrepancy Resolution Ownership**: Both Purchasing and AP Clerks may contact suppliers directly, or they may involve the Supplier Relationship Manager. This looks comprehensive and accurate based on the transcripts."
