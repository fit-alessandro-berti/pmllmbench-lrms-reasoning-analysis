The Discrepancy (Bias): Look at Case U003 vs. Case P002. P002 (Group A): Score 710 -> Rejected. U003 (Group B): Raw Score 695 -> Adjusted 705 -> Approved. Group A Threshold: 720 (Approved), 710 (Rejected). Group B U003: Raw 695 + 10 = 705. Result: Approved. Correction: In Group A, 710 was Rejected. In Group B, 705 (Adjusted) was Approved. This indicates a lower effective threshold for Group B if they belong to the specific community group."

CommunityGroup: In Group B, membership in Highland Civic Darts Club triggers a +10 score adjustment. Group A never has this option (always None). Systematic Difference: Group A is judged strictly on merit (Preliminary Score). Group B receives preferential treatment (Community Boost) based on an affiliation that Group A does not have access to or is not recorded for. Crucial Finding: Case U003 was approved with an adjusted score of 705. Case P002 was rejected with a score of 710. Conclusion: An applicant with a lower score (705) was approved in Group B, while an applicant with a higher score (710) was rejected in Group A. This is clear disparate impact."

Does it mean Which log shows the evidence of biased treatment? or Which group is being biased against? Context suggests Which log contains the evidence of the biased mechanism? The bias mechanism (the boost) is visible in Group Bs log. The effect of the bias (disadvantage) is visible by comparing A to B. I will frame it as: The bias is evident when comparing the two, but the mechanism is explicitly recorded in Group Bs log. Actually, its better to say the system logic revealed in Group Bs log creates the bias relative to Group A."

Here, Group B (Unprotected) is getting the advantage. This is reverse bias or simply bias favoring the Unprotected group. Bias Manifestation: The bias manifests as preferential treatment for Group B via the ScoreAdjustment column, specifically tied to CommunityGroup. If Group A is Protected, they are being disadvantaged. Why is Group B Unprotected? Usually, this means they are the majority or dominant group."

Refining the Which Log answer: I should state that the bias is systemic, but the Group B log explicitly reveals the preferential mechanism (ScoreAdjustment) that is absent in Group A. Comparing the two confirms the discriminatory outcome."
