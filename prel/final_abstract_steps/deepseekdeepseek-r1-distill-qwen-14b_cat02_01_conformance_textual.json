    "Text": "First, I need to understand the normative process described. It starts with receiving an order, then checking the inventory. If theres enough stock, the next steps are authorizing payment, packaging, shipping, and then closing the order. If theres not enough stock, after checking inventory, the process cancels the order and then closes it. The key constraints are about the order of activities: payment authorization must come after inventory check but before packaging, packaging before shipping, and shipping cant happen after a cancellation. Also, closing is always the last activity."

    "Text": "Looking at the event log, there are five cases. Ill go through each one to see if they follow the expected flow. Case 1 looks fine. It starts with Receive, then Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. Thats the standard flow when inventory is sufficient. Case 2 has a problem. The activities are Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, packaging happens before authorizing payment. According to the normative process, authorization should come before packaging. So this is a violation because the payment isnt authorized yet when they started packaging, which could be risky. Case 3 has another issue. After Receive, Check, Authorize, they cancel the order. But then it ships the order after cancellation, which is not allowed. The normative process says that after cancellation, you should close the order, not proceed with shipping. So shipping after cancellation is a clear violation. Case 4 seems okay. Its Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. That follows the insufficient inventory path correctly without any deviations. Case 5 is problematic as well. It goes Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, wheres the packaging step? According to the process, after authorizing payment, you should package the items before shipping. Skipping packaging might mean the items werent properly prepared, which could lead to issues in shipping. So this is a violation because shipping happened without packaging first."
