We are instructed Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt. But then we should produce a dictionary with activity pairs as keys and values as tuples (average_time, standard_deviation). The instructions say: For each pair of activities that appear in this global supply chain process in event logs (not only directly connected, but eventually following each other), assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, as the LLM should estimate these times. Wait the instruction Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information means we need to produce a dictionary with placeholders? But then what do we output exactly: We are allowed to estimate numbers for average time and standard deviation? The instructions say: For example: {('A','B'): (86400, 3600)} which indicates average time is some number in seconds. But then it says Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt. This means that we should produce a dictionary with estimated values, but the numbers should be guessed by us? Wait re-read: The task says: - Your task: Produce a Python dictionary representing the temporal profile. For each pair of activities ... assign an estimated average time and standard deviation. Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt. So that means the LLM should produce a dictionary with numeric values? It instructs: Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt - That might be to avoid giving away hints."

We must consider not only immediate successors but also non-adjacent ones.

That's two steps, so we can have a dictionary entry for that pair).

Possibly we want increasing durations as the distance increases because they are cumulative delays ... Maybe I'll decide: The process has 10 activities. Let each immediate step have a base duration and variance. Then for pairs that are not adjacent, it is sum of durations.

Maybe I'll do: - ('SS','OP'): avg = 3600 sec, std = 1800 (ratio 2:1). - ('OP','RC'): avg = 86400 sec, std = 3600 sec (ratio 24:1).
