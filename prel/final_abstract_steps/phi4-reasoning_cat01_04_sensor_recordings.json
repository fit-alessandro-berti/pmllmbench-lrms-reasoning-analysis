    "Text": "Then event 4 onward: Theres a change in sensor readings with significant increase in temperature to ~50°C, vibration level increased drastically to 30 Hz and so on, with material flow starting at 5 units/s from event 4 (and remains 5 until event 6). Tool position changes gradually from 0 mm (pre-phase) to 5 mm, then 7 mm, then 10 mm. So events 4-6 are a sequence that could be interpreted as Cutting Metal because the temperature jump and vibration increase might represent machine tool operations like cutting, machining etc."

    "Text": "Events 4-6: A phase where temperature and vibration jump high; material flow increases from 0 to 5 units/s; tool position moves from 0 mm to 10 mm; energy consumption climbs. That suggests an active machining process. Given the options provided: Cutting Metal, Assembling Parts, Welding, Quality Inspection, Packaging. The pattern with high temperature and vibration is consistent with cutting or welding operations because both can involve high temperatures, but in cutting, you expect tool movement maybe to be high speed."

    "Text": "Events 7-8: They have different pattern: Temperature drops slightly (from 58°C to 40°C) compared to event 6, vibration level drops from 38 Hz to 10 Hz, material flow rate decreases drastically to 2 units/s. Pressure increases to 2 bar, tool position jumps to 15 mm, energy consumption at 2.00 kWh. This seems like a transition phase maybe preparing for another operation. But what could it be? Possibly Welding or Assembling Parts?"

    "Text": "Event 9 is quite distinct because temperature jumps to 80°C, vibration level becomes extremely high (50 Hz), material flow drops completely (0 units/s) while energy consumption spikes at 5.00 kWh. That could represent a welding process where the machine uses high temperatures and energy to join metal parts, along with increased vibrations due to torch oscillations."

    "Text": "Events 10-12: Temperature decreases to 30°C, pressure goes down to 1 bar, vibrations drop to 1 Hz then 5 Hz gradually, material flow increases slightly (0 -> 1 unit/s), tool position goes from 15 mm to 20 mm, energy consumption becomes lower (~1.00 to 1.60 kWh). This pattern might indicate Packaging or Finishing stage? But lets consider: After the welding operation (event 9) which had high temperature and vibration level, then event 10 shows a sharp drop in temperature and vibration; material flow is still low though it increases slightly. Tool position changes from 15 mm to 20 mm. This could be something like a cooling period or maybe Quality Inspection where the machine might check for defects with sensors."

    "Text": "Group 3 (Events 7-8): It has lower vibration and temperature compared to cutting metal but still is an active operation with moderate tool movement. It could represent a joining activity that might be Assembling Parts, where the parts have been cut and then moved into position for assembly, or it could be considered Welding if welding was done in group 4; however, event 9 shows high temperature spike so likely not assembly."

    "Text": "Between Quality Inspection and Packaging: Quality inspection normally involves visual or sensor-based measurements of the workpiece; however, in an automated assembly line, quality inspection might also be integrated with sensors but not necessarily involve movement. Meanwhile, packaging generally would require controlled movements to position the product for final handling. In this event log, theres a slight increase in material flow from 0 to 1 unit/s and tool position moves gradually by 5 mm. That suggests a gentle repositioning activity consistent with Packaging."

    "Text": "Group 5 (Events 10-12): This group shows a cooling down phase with low energy, and slight movement in tool position as if aligning or packaging the finished product. Considering candidate labels: Quality Inspection might involve checks of dimensions but usually not much machine motion; Packaging is more likely to have repositioning of parts and material flow increase for wrapping or moving items into a container."
