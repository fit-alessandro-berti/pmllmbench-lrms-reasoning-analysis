    "Text": "First, I should think about what each part of the supply chain does. They start with R&D, design new models, then move to sourcing components from various suppliers with different lead times and quality metrics. Each supplier has its own strengths, like Taiwan for microprocessors, Japan for camera modules, etc. So maybe a question about lead times and how they affect the overall process."

    "Text": "Then, the assembly line in Malaysia runs 24/7, which is a lot. How does that affect lead times and production efficiency? Also, they use 24/7, so maybe there's a question about how they manage production from multiple shifts."

    "Text": "After assembly, the products are packed and shipped via different modesâ€”air and cargo. How does that affect the shipping lead time and cost? Also, the transportation has to coordinate with global logistics partners, which might bring up issues with different time zones or regulatory differences."

    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Implications of decisions: If a supplier cuts lead times, it might affect other stages, leading to longer lead times. If supply chain disruptions occur due to geopolitical reasons, it could impact global supply. High costs might lead to financial losses, requiring more investment in quality or efficiency."
