The FinalDecision for P001 (720) and P003 (740) are Approved, but P002 (710) was Rejected. So their approval is based purely on the preliminary score."

Looking at the ScoreAdjustment: - For U001 and U003 (with CommunityGroup), they get a +10 adjustment because of the Community Boost. So their adjusted scores are 720 and 705 respectively.

Because 720 and 740 get approved, but 710 is rejected. Wait, that seems inconsistent. Wait, actually, maybe the cutoff is 720? Because P002 at 710 is below that. Wait, but P001 is exactly 720 and was approved. So maybe 720 is the cutoff. So anything equal or above gets approved? Then why P002 at 710 was rejected, which is below."

Wait, but the user is asking which groups log exhibits bias. So maybe the Unprotected Group (Group B) is receiving an adjustment (Community Boost) that the Protected Group (Group A) is not. But that might be favoring Group B in some cases, but in the logs, the Protected Group (Group A) had P001 at 720 approved, but Group Bs U001s adjusted score is 730 (so higher than 720) but U003s adjusted is 705, which would be below the cutoff if the cutoff is 720.

Since the Unprotected group (B) is getting an adjustment (Community Boost) when they are in a community group, but the Protected group isnt. So Group B members in the community get a boost which helps them get approved even with lower scores.

Since the Protected Group is supposed to be protected, giving an adjustment to another group might be a form of bias against the protected group.

Therefore, the answer is that Group Bs log exhibits bias because the CommunityBoost is applied to some of their applicants, leading to approvals that Protected Group applicants with similar preliminary scores wouldnt get. So the explanation is that Group Bs log shows a ScoreAdjustment (Community Boost) that isnt available to Group A, resulting in different outcomes even with lower initial scores.
