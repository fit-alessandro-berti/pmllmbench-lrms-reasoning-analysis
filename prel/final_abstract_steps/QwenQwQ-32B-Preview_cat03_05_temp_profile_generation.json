Looking at (SS, RC), for example, with an average of 1,555,200 seconds and a standard deviation of 440,640 seconds, which is about 28% of the average. This seems plausible for supply chain processes where lead times can vary significantly. Similarly, for (PK, AS), with an average of 262,080 seconds and a standard deviation of 121,632 seconds, which is about 46% of the average. This higher variability could be due to fluctuating demand and distribution schedules."

    "Text": "I should also consider that some activities might have smaller variability relative to their averages. For instance, in manufacturing processes, certain stages like assembly or testing might have more controlled times, leading to smaller standard deviations. Given that, I might adjust some standard deviations to be smaller percentages of their averages. For example: - (CA, PT): Average 21,600 s, Std Dev 10,800 s (50%) - Perhaps reduce std dev to 2,160 s (10% of average) ... This adjustment assumes that these transitions are more tightly controlled in the manufacturing process."
