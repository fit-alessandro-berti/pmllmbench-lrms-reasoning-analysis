The process involves several activities from supplier selection all the way to after-sales support. I have to estimate average times and standard deviations for the time intervals between various activity pairs."

SS to OP: Supplier selection might take a few days to a week, depending on the complexity of the selection process. 2. OP to RC: Order placement to receipt of components depends on the supplier's lead time, which could be a week to a month. ... And so I proceed to estimate for all direct transitions."
