I need to write a SQL query to filter out certain cases based on specific conditions and then return all events from the remaining cases."

    "Text": "Let me first understand what exactly is being asked. I need to identify cases that have a specific sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', and then immediately by 'Confirm Order'. Moreover, among these cases, I need to further filter those where the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, I should exclude these cases from the final result, meaning I want all events from cases that do not have this specific sequence with the timing condition."
