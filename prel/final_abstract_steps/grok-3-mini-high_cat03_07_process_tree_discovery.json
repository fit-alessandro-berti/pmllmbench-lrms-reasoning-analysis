No, if * (VF, RMI), the shortest is VF, but in traces, when loop is present, it starts with RMI, not VF. In Case 1, after AE, RMI then VF, no VF without RMI in the loop part. In fact, the initial VF is already done before AE. So the loop VF would be a second VF, but in * (VF, RMI), it could have VF without RMI, but in the log, when the loop is executed, theres RMI, and also it could have multiple VF, but in log, VF is executed only once per loop execution in this context."

    "Text": "Perhaps its not a standard loop. Maybe use an exclusive choice after AE: either go to AD directly (if no missing info), or enter a loop where RMI and VF are executed, and the loop can be repeated. But in the loop, is it repeating RMI and VF together? In Case 1: RMI VF AD (so loop executed once) In Case 3: RMI RMI VF AD (here, if loop is on RMI, but VF is only once. Perhaps the loop is specifically for RMI, and VF is part of the sequence after the loop. Lets model it. Suppose after AE, there is a loop * (something, RMI). Another way: perhaps after AE, theres an optional loop that can be executed zero or more times, and each iteration involves RMI followed by VF. But in the traces, when the loop is taken, its RMI (one or more) followed by VF, then proceed. In Case 3, there are two RMI and then one VF, so its not that each iteration has RMI and VF; instead, RMI can repeat, and then VF is done once. Perhaps I can have after AE, a loop * (tau, RMI), which would allow zero or more RMI, since * (tau, RMI) executes tau (silent), then either exit or execute RMI and back to tau, so possible traces: silent (do nothing), or silent RMI silent, or silent RMI silent RMI silent, etc, but the silent steps are not visible, so effectively, zero or more RMI can be executed. Then after the loop, execute VF, then AD, etc. In the traces, when RMI is executed, its followed by VF, not that RMI can be alone. In Case 2, no RMI and no VF in the loop part? No, in Case 2, after AE, directly to AD, so no additional VF or RMI. If I put after AE a loop * (tau, RMI) after AE, then VF, then AD, then for Case 2: loop not taken (no RMI), then VF, AD, etc. But in Case 2, after AE, AD, no VF. In Case 2, there is no second VF; only the first VF after RA. In Case 1 and 3, there is a second VF after RMI. So the VF is part of the loop."

    "Text": "Lets think of the point where the choice happens. After AE, in some cases, directly to AD, in others, to RMI, and after RMI (possibly multiple), to VF, then to AD. But VF is only executed if there was RMI. Also, RMI can be zero times (in Case 2), but when zero, no VF; when one or more, then VF after the RMI(s). In the loop, when there is RMI, its followed by VF only once after the last RMI. Perhaps I can model it as: after AE, exclusive choice: either -> AD, or * (RMI, tau) followed by VF then AD. Using XOR choice. After AE, X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) ) But that would be exclusive choice between: path 1: AD, or path 2: loop of RMI (with * (RMI, tau), which allows zero or more RMI? * (RMI, tau): execute RMI first, then either exit or execute tau and back to RMI. Since tau is silent, traces for * (RMI, tau): RMI (exit after RMI), or RMI tau RMI, or RMI tau RMI tau RMI, etc. So effectively, one or more RMI, with silent steps in between, but silent steps dont show, so one or more RMI. Then followed by VF and AD. So for the choice: either directly AD, or (one or more RMI followed by VF) then AD. Now, in the traces: - If choice is direct AD, trace: AD - If choice is the other, trace: RMI+ VF AD (where RMI+ is one or more RMI) But in Case 2: after AE, AD — good, no RMI, no VF. In Case 1: after AE, RMI, VF, AD — which matches one RMI followed by VF. In Case 3: after AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD — matches two RMI followed by VF. Perfect. In the XOR choice, its exclusive, so either the direct path or the loop path. In the loop path, the loop * (RMI, tau) ensures at least one RMI, which is correct, since when the alternative is taken, there is at least one RMI. In Case 1 and 3, there is RMI, so yes. Now, what about the silent tau in the loop? In * (RMI, tau), the tau is executed when deciding to loop back, but since its silent, it doesnt appear in the trace, so the trace for the loop part is just one or more RMI concatenated. Yes. After the loop, VF and then AD."

In Case 3, its two RMI and then VF, so the RMI can repeat, and after some number, VF is done. In the XOR, I have X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) ), so AD is part of the XOR subtree. But then after this XOR, I cannot put another sequence, because AD is already included. Mistake. In my earlier XOR, I have X ( -> AD, -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF, -> AD ) ), so AD is part of the XOR subtree. But then after this XOR, I cannot put another sequence, because AD is already included. To avoid repetition, in process trees, I should have the XOR before the common part. After AE, X ( tau (silent), -> ( * (RMI, tau), VF ) ) Then after this XOR, -> AD SC AC Lets see the traces. For child1: tau (silent), so when chosen, it executes silent step, which doesnt appear. For child2: sequence of * (RMI, tau) and VF. * (RMI, tau) as before, one or more RMI. Then VF. So if XOR chooses child1: silent, then after XOR, AD, etc. So trace after AE: silent AD... but silent doesnt show, so directly AD. If XOR chooses child2: execute * (RMI, tau) (one or more RMI), then VF, then after XOR, AD, etc. So trace: RMI+ VF AD... But in the case when child2 is chosen, after VF, it goes to AD, which is correct. And when child1 is chosen, directly to AD. Perfect. And the silent tau in child1 doesnt produce any event. In child2, the * (RMI, tau) has a silent tau, but as discussed, it allows the repetition."

    "Text": "Now, does this capture all traces? For Case 2: after AE, XOR chooses the tau path (silent), then AD, etc. So trace: RA, VF, AE, AD, SC, AC — matches, with only one VF. For Case 1: after AE, XOR chooses the other path, then in the sequence, loop * (RMI, tau): suppose it executes RMI and exits (since only one RMI), then VF, then AD, etc. Trace: RA, VF, AE, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC — good. For Case 3: in the loop, it can execute RMI, then choose to loop back (via tau), execute RMI again, then exit, then VF, etc. Trace: RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC — good. Also, the loop allows more RMI if needed, but in the log, up to two, but the model allows more, which is fine for generalization. Now, about fitness, precision, simplicity: this model fits all traces in the log. Precision: it doesnt allow invalid traces, like having VF without RMI in the loop part, or multiple VF without the choice. For example, it doesnt allow a trace with AE VF AD without the XOR choice, but in this model, VF after AE only if the XOR chooses the loop path, which includes RMI first. In the loop path, its RMI then VF, so VF is always after RMI in that case. Also, it doesnt allow RMI without being followed by VF in that context. After the XOR and the potential loop and VF, it goes directly to AD, no other choices. Simplicity: it uses sequence, XOR, and loop operators, which is reasonable. No unnecessary parallel or other operators. In the beginning, RA, VF, AE are always in sequence. Then the variable part. Finally, AD, SC, AC in sequence."

    "Text": "About the parallel part: in the initial example, there was parallel, but in this log, all activities seem sequential within a case, based on timestamps. For example, in Case 1, timestamps are sequential: RA at 08:00, VF 08:30, AE 09:00, RMI 09:20, VF 10:00, AD 10:30, etc. No overlapping, so probably no parallelism needed. Similarly for other cases. So I can stick with sequence and choice and loop. Now, the full structure: Start with sequence: RA, VF, AE, then the XOR part, then AD, SC, AC. The XOR part is X ( tau, -> ( * ( RMI, tau ), VF ) ) More precisely, the XOR has two children: one is a leaf tau (silent step), and the other is a sequence: * (RMI, tau), and VF. In process tree terms, the child should be a process tree. So, define: Let xor_node = ProcessTree with operator XOR, and two children: - child1: a leaf with label tau (silent step) - child2: a sequence node with operator SEQUENCE, and two children: loop_node and VF_node VF_node is a leaf with label VF loop_node is a loop node with operator LOOP, and two children: A and B. For loop_node * (A, B), A should be RMI, B should be tau (silent). In * (RMI, tau): execute RMI, then either exit or execute tau and back to RMI. Since tau is silent, the effect is that after RMI, you can choose to exit or loop back silently and execute RMI again. So the possible traces for loop_node: RMI (if exit after first), or RMI (silent) RMI, or RMI (silent) RMI (silent) RMI, etc. So in activity traces, one or more RMI consecutively. Yes. Then in the sequence of loop_node and VF, so first the loop (one or more RMI), then VF. Perfect. And for the XOR, choosing between silent (do nothing) or the sequence (RMI+ VF). Then after XOR, sequence to AD, SC, AC. Now, all are leaves except the operators. Also, need to make sure the parent pointers are set, but since Im just describing the structure, I dont need to write code. Now, to write it in the process tree notation. The root should be a sequence operator -> with children: RA, VF, AE, xor_node, AD, SC, AC. But xor_node is itself a tree. In the sequence, the children are the subtrees in order. So root: operator SEQUENCE, children: [PT_RA, PT_VF, PT_AE, PT_XOR, PT_AD, PT_SC, PT_AC] Where PT_RA is leaf with label RA, similarly for others. PT_XOR is a process tree with operator XOR, parent set to root, and children: [PT_tau1, PT_seq_loop_VF] PT_tau1 is a leaf with label tau PT_seq_loop_VF is a process tree with operator SEQUENCE, parent set to PT_XOR, and children: [PT_loop_RMI, PT_VF2] PT_VF2 is a leaf with label VF PT_loop_RMI is a process tree with operator LOOP, parent set to PT_seq_loop_VF, and children: [PT_RMI, PT_tau2] PT_RMI is a leaf with label RMI PT_tau2 is a leaf with label tau In the loop * (A, B), A and B are subtrees, so PT_RMI and PT_tau2 are leaves. Now, about the labels: in the event log, activities are like Receive Application (RA), but in the process tree, we can use the shorthand like RA, as in the example. Similarly for others. In the loop, we have two tau nodes: one for the XOR choice (silent, meaning no action), and one for the loop back (silent decision). Thats fine. This should work. Is there a way to make it simpler? For example, without the silent steps, but I think silent steps are necessary to model the optional part and the loop decision. In some process discovery algorithms, they might produce different models, but this seems to capture the behavior accurately. About the repeating RMI: in the loop * (RMI, tau), it allows RMI to be repeated, with the decision after each RMI. In the log, the decision might be after a series, but the model allows it, and its fine. I think this is a good model. So, to box the answer, I need to present the process tree structure. Root: operator SEQUENCE, children: 1. Leaf: label RA 2. Leaf: label VF 3. Leaf: label AE 4. XOR node: operator XOR, children: a. Leaf: label tau b. Sequence node: operator SEQUENCE, children: i. Loop node: operator LOOP, children: - Leaf: label RMI - Leaf: label tau ii. Leaf: label VF 5. Leaf: label AD 6. Leaf: label SC 7. Leaf: label AC In the sequence after XOR, its directly AD, etc. In my earlier thought, after the XOR node, in the root sequence, we have the XOR, then AD, SC, AC. And the XOR handles the part before AD. Now, about the labels: in the event log, activities are given with full names, but in the process tree, we can use the abbreviations as in the table, like RA, VF, etc. I think its fine. To make it clear, I can use the full names, but abbreviations are okay. In the loop, the second tau is for the loop back, and the first tau is for the silent choice. This should work."
