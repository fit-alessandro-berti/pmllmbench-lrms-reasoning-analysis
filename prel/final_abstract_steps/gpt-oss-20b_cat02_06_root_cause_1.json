Actually close at March2 09:15. So duration from March1 08:05 to March2 09:15 = that's >25h? Let's compute difference. From Mar1 08:05 to Mar2 08:05 is exactly24h, plus another hour and ten minutes =>25h10m =1510 min. Case103: from Mar1 08:10 to Mar1 09:30 =1h20m=80min. Case104: from Mar1 08:20 to Mar2 08/30?

That's two days (48h) + (9-8) hours + (30-25) minutes? Wait times are in hh:mm but we have only hour minute maybe not minute for all events except some have minute values like 14 etc. For case105 close time is 2024-03-03 09 30. So difference: Mar1 08 25 ->Mar3 09 30 From Mar1 -> Mar3 is two days =48 hours. Add from 08 25 -> 09 00 on same day? Actually we cross midnight; easier compute using datetime. Let's approximate: Start timestamp 2024-03-01T08:25 End timestamp 2024-03-03T09:30 Difference: March01->March02 same day difference until midnight ~16 hours? Wait start at March01T08 25; end on March03T09 30. Compute using Python mental or manual: From start to end of Day01 (midnight): remaining in Day01 after start until midnight of Day02? Start at T=2024-03-01 08 25 End of that day (midnight) is T=2024-03-02 00 00 Duration Day01 remainder = (2460 - (860+25)) minutes =1440 -505=935 min (~15h35m) Then full Day02 duration =24*60=1440 min Then part of Day03 until T=09 30: Duration partDay3 =9*60+30=570 min Total minutes =935+1440+570=2945 min 49 h5 m"

Investigate->Resolve wait across midnight diff huge because investigate ends on next day early morning then resolve next morning again after a long gap maybe due to overnight shift or backlog. Specifically Investigate started on March01 @14 :00 ; Resolve on March02 @09 :00 => about19 hrs waiting between investigate and resolve due possibly no agent available or backlog. Also Escalation step adds delay as it requires Level-2 agent assignment etc. Case104: Receive->Triage wait 40 mins Triage->Assign wait50 mins Assign->Investigate wait~3 hrs40mins Investigate starts late afternoon; Resolve next morning early but there may be overnight delay again about19hrs between investigate and resolve similar pattern as case102 but less severe because investigation earlier? Actually Investigate starts at13 :00 ; Resolve next day @08 :00 => about19hrs again causing delay due shift change/backlog. Also no escalation but still long waiting before investigation maybe due triage or assignment delays? But the main cause seems the overnight gap between investigation and resolution leading to high cycle time for cases that require more complex issues requiring Level-2 support or extended analysis across shifts leading to delays beyond working hours. Also Case105 has multiple escalations and repeated investigations across multiple days causing huge cycle time. Steps show initial investigation quickly resolved by Level-2 later but then second investigation occurs after escalation again causing further delays across days with large gaps between events e.g., Escalation occurs early morning then second Investigation begins next day midday etc leading huge cycle time >49hrs."

    "Text": "Root causes identified: Escalations add significant overhead/time due to handover process & specialized team availability. Long waiting times before Investigation step especially when ticket moves into Level-2 queue or when theres a shift change causing overnight idle period before resolution can be performed. Unnecessary delays such as extended triage periods (>40-50min) may indicate inefficiencies in triage process or insufficient staffing during peak times. Repeated investigations / re-escalations cause duplication of effort & increased cycle time (#105)."

    "Text": "Recommendations: Implement SLA thresholds for each activity; trigger alerts if waiting times exceed thresholds e.g., triage >45min triggers review. Automate handover notifications & pre-fill required information for Level-2 agents so they can start work immediately upon escalation without extra prep time. Introduce cross-shift coverage or overlapping shifts so that tickets investigated late afternoon can be resolved promptly the following shift rather than staying idle overnight e.g., assign a night support team for pending investigations/resolutions scheduled after business hours. Reduce unnecessary re-investigations by ensuring proper knowledge base updates & training so Level-1 agents can handle more issues without escalation where possible this reduces overall cycle time and backlog accumulation that leads backlogs during off-hours causing delays later in the process chain (#104)."
