Need to make sure each question is open-ended and targets a specific part of the process. Avoid yes/no questions.

How is the decision made regarding which property manager is assigned to a new property, considering factors like workload and geographic specialization? 4. Can you describe the typical process for the property manager conducting an initial meeting with the landlord, including which topics are discussed to align expectations? 5. How are the timelines determined for scheduling the photographer and inspector after documentation verification? 6. What steps are taken if the inspector identifies safety or habitability issues, and how are landlords involved in resolving these problems? 7. How are the photographers images selected for marketing materials, and how often are listings updated based on market trends? 8. When assigning contractors for repairs identified by the inspector, what criteria are used to select them, such as experience with similar issues or cost efficiency? 9. How is the decision made to offer short-term promotional discounts or negotiate lease terms with multiple interested tenants? 10. What protocols are in place to ensure that the digital marketing content accurately reflects the propertys features and attracts the target demographic? 11. How is the activation of a property defined in terms of its availability for tenants, and what marketing strategies are prioritized during this phase? 12. What screening criteria beyond credit checks and employment verification are used to assess potential tenants, especially those who may request special lease clauses? 13. How are quality checks conducted post-leasing, and who is responsible for ensuring compliance with fair housing and pricing strategies? 14. What internal processes ensure that the propertys data entries and online listings are accurately integrated into the companys systems after onboarding? 15. How are exceptions, such as properties requiring special insurance or custom lease clauses, identified and managed throughout the onboarding process? 16. What communication protocols are established between the property manager, landlord, and support teams to handle inquiries or issues that arise during the onboarding lifecycle? 17. Can you provide an example of how a unique landlord requirement (e.g., furnished rentals) influenced the onboarding process or property management approach? 18. How are timing constraints, such as urgent repairs or quick tenant turnover, balanced with the need for thorough documentation and inspection in the process? 19. What tools or systems are used to track the progress of each step in the onboarding process, and how are stakeholders informed about milestones or delays? 20. How does the company ensure consistency in the onboarding experience across different regions or property types, especially when dealing with varied local regulations and market conditions?"
