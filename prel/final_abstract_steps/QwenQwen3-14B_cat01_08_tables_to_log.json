However, the user mentioned that if multiple timestamps are available, we can produce one event per activity if meaningful.

    "Text": "Wait, but looking at the data, for order 1001, two items were picked on 2024-01-02 at different times. So, maybe each item's picking is an event? But that might lead to too many events. Alternatively, the \"Items Picked\" event could be when all items for the order are picked. However, the data shows that some items in the same order were picked on different dates. For example, order 1003 has two items picked on the same day, 2024-01-05. But order 1001 has two items picked on the same day but different times. But the problem says to ensure chronological order. So perhaps, for each order, the earliest item_picking_date is when the picking started, and the latest is when it ended. But the user might want to capture each item's picking as an event. However, the instructions say to produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful. Hmm. The example given in the task includes \"Items Picked\" event(s) from the Order Lines table. The (s) suggests that multiple events could be present. So perhaps, for each item in the order, we have an \"Item Picked\" event. However, the problem might not require that level of granularity. Alternatively, maybe \"Items Picked\" is a single event for the entire order, with the latest item_picking_date as the timestamp. But that might not capture the actual sequence. Let me think. If the items are picked on different dates, then the order of picking might be important. For example, if one item is picked on 2024-01-02 at 10:15 and another on the same day at 11:00, then the first item is picked first, then the second. But in the event log, each of these would be separate events. However, the user might not need that level of detail. The problem says, \"produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate.\" So maybe summarizing by the order, taking the earliest or latest date. But the example given in the task says \"Items Picked\" event(s), which suggests that multiple events could be present. However, looking at the data, for order 1001, two items were picked on the same day but different times. If we take the earliest time as the timestamp for \"Items Picked\", then the event would be at 10:15. But that might not be accurate. Alternatively, maybe we need to create a separate event for each item being picked. However, the problem might not require that. Since the user hasn't specified, maybe the safest approach is to create a single \"Items Picked\" event per order, using the latest item_picking_date as the timestamp. Because if items are picked on different dates, the order might not be fully picked until the last item is picked. For example, order 1002 has two items picked on 2024-01-03 at 09:45 and 10:00. So the latest is 10:00, so the \"Items Picked\" event would be at 10:00. But that might not be correct. Alternatively, the earliest date is when the picking started. However, the problem might not require such granularity. Given that, perhaps the best approach is to create a single \"Items Picked\" event per order, using the latest item_picking_date as the timestamp. That way, we can ensure that all items are picked before moving to the next step."
