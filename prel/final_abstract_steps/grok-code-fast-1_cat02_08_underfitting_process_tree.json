    "Text": "Reviewing Branching Logic - The xor operator ensures choosing either the successful branch or cancel branch after check_inventory, preventing interleaving between them. - This structure means you can't start the successful branch (e.g., authorize_payment) and then cancel, maintaining distinct paths."
