    "Text": "\"Receive Customer Request\" is starting point. Then there's a gateway which checks request type: Standard vs Custom. For standard requests, it performs standard validation. For custom, perform feasibility analysis. For each branch: -- Standard branch: Once validated, go to parallel processing (gateway AND) for credit check and inventory check; then after joining, the process calculates delivery date. -- Custom branch: After performing feasibility analysis, another gateway checks if customization is feasible. If yes, prepare custom quotation. Otherwise, send rejection notice which ends the process. Then there's a step after standard/custom path tasks are completed. At that point, there is a gateway for \"Is Approval Needed?\" In that case: -- If approval needed: then \"Obtain Manager Approval\" is executed, then another XOR gateway asks if approval granted; if yes, generate final invoice; if no, re-evaluate conditions and loop back to previous tasks (for custom path or standard path). The note clarifies that for custom request, it goes back to Task E1 (\"Prepare Custom Quotation\") and for Standard Path, loops back to Task D (\"Calculate Delivery Date\"). Alternatively, if approval is not needed then simply generate final invoice. -- Then after generating final invoice, \"Send Confirmation to Customer\" sends the confirmation."

    "Text": "We must provide an explanation covering these tasks: I'll first list steps: - Start event: process starts when a customer request is received. - Task A: \"Receive Customer Request.\" Purpose: The initial entry point for new customer orders. - Gateway (XOR): \"Check Request Type\": Branch decision based on type of request. This gateway ensures that the following tasks differ depending on whether it's standard or custom. It is an exclusive gateway meaning exactly one branch must be taken. For Standard requests: - Task B1: \"Perform Standard Validation.\" Purpose: Validate details for a standard order. - Gateway (AND) \"Run Parallel Checks\": Purpose to execute multiple checks concurrently, such as credit and inventory check. - Under parallel tasks: - Task C1: \"Credit Check\": Ensure customer's creditworthiness. - Task C2: \"Inventory Check\": Verify product availability. - After both parallel tasks complete, join (convergence) then - Task D: \"Calculate Delivery Date\" is executed. Purpose: Calculate the expected delivery time based on order parameters and available stock etc. For Custom requests: - Task B2: \"Perform Custom Feasibility Analysis.\" Purpose: Determine if a custom solution or product modification can be provided. - Then gateway (XOR): \"Is Customization Feasible?\" to decide if the customization is possible. - [If Yes] then Task E1: \"Prepare Custom Quotation\" is executed. Purpose: Provide price quote for customized order. - [If No] then Task E2: \"Send Rejection Notice\" and process ends. After completing either standard or custom branch: - There's another gateway (XOR): \"Is Approval Needed?\" to decide if the next step requires manager approval. - If Yes, then Task F: \"Obtain Manager Approval\" is executed. Purpose: To get authorization for order processing. - After obtaining approval, there's a further decision point using a gateway (XOR) \"Is Approval Granted?\" - [If yes] then Task G: \"Generate Final Invoice\". Purpose: Create final invoice after approval. - [If no] then Task H: \"Re-evaluate Conditions\" is executed. This rework step triggers a loop back to either: - For Custom Path: loop back to Task E1 (\"Prepare Custom Quotation\") to revise the quotation if necessary, - For Standard Path: loop back to Task D (\"Calculate Delivery Date\"), possibly recalculating delivery date after changes. - If Not needed for approval then directly execute Task G: \"Generate Final Invoice\" (bypassing manager approval). After generating final invoice: - Task I: \"Send Confirmation to Customer\" is executed. Purpose: Provide customer confirmation of the order processing and invoice details. Then process ends."

    "Text": "The process handles two types of orders: - Standard orders go through standard validations and checks. - Custom orders have additional feasibility analysis and quotation process; if customization is not possible then order is rejected. Approval is needed in some cases. If manager approval is required, then the process goes to obtain that approval. If approval isn't granted, a rework loop is triggered based on path type: - In custom branch, re-evaluate conditions (re-run feasibility analysis and quotation). - In standard branch, re-calc delivery date possibly after adjustments. Convergence: All tasks eventually merge at the point where final invoice generation occurs. Then confirmation to customer is sent out as a final step before process termination."
