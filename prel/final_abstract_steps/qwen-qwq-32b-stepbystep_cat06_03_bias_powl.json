    "Text": "Ah heres the thing The problem states that the XOR is part of the process flow Since its an XOR the process must choose one of the branches So the selection between D or skip is probably based on some criteria But the problem doesnt specify how the choice is made Wait but in the model the XOR is part of the processs structure Maybe the decision to take D or not is based on some attributes of the applicant Like maybe if they are a local resident or part of a community group they go through D otherwise skip Wait the transition D is CheckLocalAffiliation so perhaps the check itself is part of the process Wait the transition D is CheckLocalAffiliation which I assume evaluates whether the applicant is a local resident or part of a known community group If they are then maybe they get the score uplift"

    "Text": "Wait the problem says that the XOR is part of the process flow so the choice between D and skip is made by the systems logic The question is what criteria determine which branch is taken The problem statement says that choosing D leads to a subtle score uplift So if an applicant goes through D and meets the criteria local residencycommunity their score goes up But if they skip D they dont get that uplift"

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Therefore the key is which applicants are more likely to be routed to D versus the skip If the routing is based on attributes that correlate with membership in a certain group that could be biased For example if non legally protected groups like say certain ethnic groups that arent protected classes are more likely to be local residents or part of community groups then they might be more often routed through D getting the score boost giving them an advantage over others"

  {

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the bias comes from the fact that some applicants are more likely to go through D and thus get the score boost based on their attributes The XORs selection criteria could be based on attributes that correlate with group membership"
