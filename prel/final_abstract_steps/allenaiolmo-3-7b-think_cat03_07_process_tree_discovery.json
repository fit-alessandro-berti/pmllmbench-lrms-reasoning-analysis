    "Text": "First, I need to understand the event log data. Looking at the table, there are three cases (Case IDs 1, 2, 3). Each case goes through a sequence of activities: Receive Application (RA), Validate Form (VF), Assess Eligibility (AE), then Request Missing Info (RMI). But then, in case 3, after the first RMI, theres another RMI, followed by another VF before proceeding to Approval Decision (AD) and so on. Let me break down the activities for each case: Case 1: RA VF AE RMI VF AD SC AC Case 2: RA VF AE RMI AD SC AC Case 3: RA VF AE RMI RMI VF AD SC AC"
