    "Text": "First, understanding the hiring process: 1. Initial Application Submission: Applicants submit their resumes and a questionnaire. This is the starting point. 2. Resume Parsing & Data Check: An automated system scans the resume for key info. If data is missing, the applicant is prompted again, creating a loop. 3. Skill Assessment: Applicants take an online test. Those who don't meet the score proceed. 4. Cultural Fit Check: This is where the potential bias lies. If an applicant is in the Global Business Leaders Club or is a local resident, they get a subjective boost. 5. Managerial Review & Final Decision: A hiring manager reviews borderline candidates, possibly unconsciously favoring those with local ties."

    "Text": "Now, translating this into POWL models. For the first model with potential unfairness: - After the skill assessment, there's an XOR choice. One branch is a standard cultural fit check. The other branch is a CommunityAffiliationCheck that gives an advantage if the applicant is affiliated. - This means after SkillAssessment, there's a choice between two paths: one leading to CulturalFitCheck and the other to CommunityAffiliationCheck. - Both paths should lead to ManagerialReview and then FinalDecision. - Also, there's a loop after ResumeParsing to ensure data completeness."

    "Text": "For the second model without unfairness: - After the skill assessment, all applicants go through the standard CulturalFitCheck without any special branches. - The process remains the same but without the XOR choice that introduced the bias. - So, after SkillAssessment, it's a straight path to CulturalFitCheck, followed by ManagerialReview and FinalDecision."
