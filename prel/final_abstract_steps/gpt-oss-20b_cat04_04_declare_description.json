Make sure to follow formatting rules: Use LaTeX for math expressions if any; but we might not need math. We can still use inline math for referencing activities? Not necessary but could use Receive_Application etc. But it's optional. Better keep simple plain text with headings and bullet lists; no code blocks unless needed to show mapping between constraints and activities maybe in table form using Markdown table. That is fine."
