    "Text": "3 Always After This is the opposite if the first activity occurs then the second activity must occur after For example if RO occurs then CA must occur after Similarly if CA occurs then RI must occur after But note the chain of directlyfollows constraints already enforces that However we can define alwaysafter set for j in range0 lenactivities1 for i in rangej1 lenactivities if the first activity activitiesj occurs then the second activitiesi must occur after but the constraint says if the first activity occurs then the second activity is executed in one of the following events So we want activitiesj activitiesi alwaysafteradd activitiesj activitiesi That would be 45 pairs again But note the constraint is if the first activity occurs then the second activity must occur after So for RO we require that CA RI PI RP occur after However that is true But wait if RO occurs then we must have CA immediately after And then RI etc So yes all the rest must occur But note the constraint does not require that the second activity must occur It only says if the first occurs and the second occurs then the second must be after Or does it say if the first occurs then the second must occur If the first activity occurs then the second activity is executed in one of the following events This implies that the second activity must occur But in our process every activity must occur So we can set For every pair i j with iltj alwaysafteradd activitiesi activitiesj meaning if activitiesi occurs then activitiesj must occur after But note the constraint also implies that activitiesj must occur However we already set activfreq to 1 for every activity So every activity occurs Therefore we can set alwaysafter to the same 45 pairs But wait if we set both alwaysbefore and alwaysafter for the same pairs Example for RO CA alwaysbefore CA RO if CA occurs then RO must have occurred before alwaysafter RO CA if RO occurs then CA must occur after That is symmetric Actually they are two different constraints However note if we set activfreq to 1 for every activity then every activity occurs exactly once Then CA RO in alwaysbefore CA occurs RO must have occurred which it does and before satisfied RO CA in alwaysafter RO occurs CA must occur after satisfied So both are redundant But the Log Skeleton model allows to specify both Alternatively we can avoid redundancy However the problem does not specify We can choose to set alwaysbefore for every pair later earlier in the sequence alwaysafter for every pair earlier later in the sequence And that covers the entire partial order But note the directlyfollows constraints are also there So we have directlyfollows the immediate succession And then alwaysbefore the full partial order which in this case is total for nonimmediate pairs Actually the directlyfollows constraints are stronger they enforce immediacy Therefore we might not need the alwaysbefore and alwaysafter But the problem says The Log Skeleton is expressed as a Python dictionary containing the keys We must provide all keys We can set equivalence set no equivalence pairs alwaysbefore the set of pairs later earlier for every nonconsecutive pair alwaysafter the set of pairs earlier later for every nonconsecutive pair nevertogether set no two activities that cannot occur together activfreq dictionary with each activity 1 directlyfollows the consecutive pairs But note the alwaysbefore and alwaysafter constraints are not only for nonconsecutive They are for any pair Actually they are for any pair that are not consecutive But consecutive pairs are covered by directlyfollows However the alwaysbefore constraint for consecutive pairs is also true For example CA RO is consecutive So we can include consecutive pairs in alwaysbefore Therefore we can set alwaysbefore set a b for a in activities for b in activities if a comes after b in the sequence Similarly for alwaysafter But note the directlyfollows constraint is stronger it requires immediacy So if we have RO CA in directlyfollows then we know that after RO comes CA immediately But we also have CA RO in alwaysbefore That is redundant However the Log Skeleton model allows redundancy Alternatively we can avoid including consecutive pairs in alwaysbefore and alwaysafter But the problem does not specify Let me reread the Log Skeleton constraints are independent So we can include alwaysbefore all pairs X Y such that Y is before X in the sequence alwaysafter all pairs X Y such that Y is after X in the sequence directlyfollows the consecutive pairs That would be acceptable But note the alwaysafter constraint RO CA is the same as the directlyfollows constraint RO CA in the sense that the directlyfollows constraint implies the alwaysafter But the alwaysafter constraint does not require immediacy Actually the directlyfollows constraint RO CA says if RO occurs then CA must occur immediately after This implies that CA occurs after RO So the alwaysafter constraint RO CA is redundant Similarly the alwaysbefore constraint CA RO is also implied Therefore we can set alwaysbefore set because the directlyfollows chain and the fact that every activity occurs once enforces the order alwaysafter set same reason"
