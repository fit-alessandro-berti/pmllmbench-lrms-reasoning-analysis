Lets break down the process: - The process starts with Receive Order (RO). - Then, we Check Availability (CA). - After checking availability, we Reserve Items (RI). - Then, we Pick Items (PI). - Then, a Quality Check (QC) is performed. - Then, we Pack Order (PO). - Then, we Generate Shipping Label (GSL). - Then, we Dispatch (D). - After dispatch, we can Invoice Customer (IC). - Finally, when payment is received, we Record Payment (RP)."

However, the problem says Activity Occurrences: Bounds the number of occurrences for an activity in a case. We can set each activity to {1} meaning exactly once? But note: what about Record Payment? It might occur later? But still, per order, it occurs once."

Because the directly_follows constraints and the fact that each activity occurs exactly once would enforce the order?"

We can choose to rely on directly_follows? But note: the Log Skeleton model uses both. And the always_before constraint is more general: it doesnt require immediacy. Since the process is sequential and we have the directly_follows chain, we can omit the always_before? Or we can include a minimal set?"

    "Text": "But wait: what if an order fails the quality check? Then we might have to re-pick? So PI might occur multiple times? The problem does not specify rework. We assume a linear process without rework? Given the problem description, it seems each activity is done once. However, let me think about the quality check: what if it fails? Then we might have to re-pick? The problem does not specify rework. So we assume the happy path? If we were to allow rework, we would have to change. But the problem does not mention. Lets code accordingly."
