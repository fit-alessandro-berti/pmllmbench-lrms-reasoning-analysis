    "Text": "Looking at how these are connected: After R, there's an XOR operator with children C and skip. So, when an order is received, the process can either check credit or skip that step. That seems odd because checking credit is a critical step to assess the customer's ability to pay. Skipping it could lead to approving orders from customers who can't pay, which is risky."
