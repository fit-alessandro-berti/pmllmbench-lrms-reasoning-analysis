    "Text": "First, I need to make sure I understand the strict rules, which are the normative process behaviors. The process always starts with receiving a loan application. After that, a credit check must be performed before any risk evaluation. So, credit check comes before risk assessment. Then, based on the risk assessment, a loan decision is madeâ€”either approved or rejected. After the decision, the applicant must be informed. If the loan is approved, there's an extra step: finalizing documentation before closing the case. But if it's rejected, you just close the case without finalizing documentation."

    "Text": "First, Risk Assessment is before Credit Check, but according to the rules, Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment. So, that's a violation of the normative process. Second, even though the loan was rejected, they still finalized documentation, which is not allowed. So, that's another violation."

That's more than 24 hours later, which is not ideal, but since it's a desideratum, not a hard rule, it's not a serious violation. Second, Inform Applicant was at 16:00 on the 16th, which is more than 48 hours after the Loan Decision at 12:00 on the 14th. Again, not ideal, but just a desideratum."

    "Text": "For Case 2, the sequence violations might be due to human error or perhaps system issues where activities were recorded in the wrong order. The finalization of documentation after rejection could be a mistake or perhaps an attempt to keep the applicant engaged, but it's against the rules."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "For Case 3, the delays could be due to busy staff, backend processing times, or perhaps waiting for additional information from the applicant. Since these are just recommendations, it's understandable, but ideally, they should aim to meet these time frames."
