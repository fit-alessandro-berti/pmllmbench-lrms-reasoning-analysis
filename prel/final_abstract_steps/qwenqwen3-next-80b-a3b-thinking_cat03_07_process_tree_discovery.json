The -> ( SC, AC ) is part of the sequence after the XOR node. Yes. Now, let's check if this matches the event log. Case 1: RA  VF  AE  choose AD directly  SC  AC. But according to this tree, after AE, the XOR node has two children: AD and the loop path. So choosing AD would go to AD, then SC and AC. Yes. But in case 1, after AE, they do RMI  VF  AD. So the path is AE  loop path  AD  SC  AC. Yes. The loop path is * ( body1, body2 )  AD. body1 is RMI  X(RMI, VF). In body1, choose VF, so RMI  VF. Then the loop executes body1 (RMI  VF), then exit. So the loop part is RMI  VF. Then proceed to AD. Yes. Case 3: AE  loop path. Execute body1: RMI  X(RMI, VF). In X, choose RMI. Then execute body2: RMI  X(RMI, VF). In X, choose VF. So RMI  RMI  VF.
