Also, the timestamps in Log B might be slightly offset. The key is to match events based on order_id and timing, even if the timestamps differ by a few seconds. Starting with the order_id. Both logs have the same order_id, Order#1234. So thats a good starting point. Let me check the timestamps."

But the difference is only a few seconds. So maybe they are considered the same event? Let me check the event names. Log Bs first event is OrderReceived which matches Log As Order Received. So thats a match."

The difference is 2 minutes. Thats a lot. So maybe thats not a match. But wait, Log As fifth event is Item Delivered at 10:20:00Z. Log Bs fifth event is Shipping at 10:05:02Z. So thats a big difference. So maybe those are separate events? Wait, but the user said that if two events appear to represent the same occurrence, merge them. So in Log Bs fourth event, Quality Check is at 10:03:00Z, which is before Log As Item Shipped at 10:05:00Z. But is that a valid match? The order_id is the same. The event names are different. Log Bs Quality Check is a quality check, while Log As Item Shipped is a shipment event. So they are different events. So they cant be merged. So they should be left as separate."

The final merged log is ordered chronologically based on the primary timestamp, with events merged where possible and left separate where necessary."
