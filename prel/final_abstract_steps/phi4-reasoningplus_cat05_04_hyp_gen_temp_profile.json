    "Text": "SQL queries: We need to propose queries on the claim_events table (or join with claims, adjusters) that can be used for verification. We'll produce sample SQL queries:\n\nFor instance:\nQuery 1: Identify specific claims where time difference between event 'R' and event 'P' is outside expected range:\n SELECT claim_id,\n        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(CASE WHEN activity = 'R' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) ) as first_receive,\n        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MAX(CASE WHEN activity = 'P' THEN timestamp END) OVER (PARTITION BY claim_id) ) as approve_time\n  FROM claim_events \n  WHERE claim_id IN (some condition?) ... Actually, we need to join events properly. Alternatively, maybe a query that finds the difference between \"R\" and \"P\" event timestamps for each claim, then filter out those claims that are significantly outside expected average of 90000 seconds +/- some factor.\n I can propose something like:\n \n SELECT ce1.claim_id,\n        (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce1.timestamp))) as time_diff\n FROM claim_events ce1, claim_events ce2\n WHERE ce1.activity = 'R'\n   AND ce2.activity = 'P'\n   AND ce2.claim_id = ce1.claim_id\n GROUP BY ce1.claim_id\n HAVING (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce2.timestamp)) - EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM MIN(ce1.timestamp))) NOT BETWEEN 90000 - 3 * some factor and 90000 + 3 * some factor. But maybe I'll propose a query that uses a window function.\n\nWe need to produce verification queries: Perhaps like below:\n\n-- For anomaly R->P, detect claims where time difference is not within 2 standard deviations from expected value:\n SELECT claim_id,\n        MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R') AS receive_time,\n        MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P') AS approve_time,\n        EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (MAX(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'P')) - MIN(timestamp) FILTER (WHERE activity = 'R')) as time_diff\n FROM claim_events \n GROUP BY claim_id\nHAVING ... etc.\n\nBut need to be careful: we need to join events per claim. But note, in many cases claims may have multiple R and P events? Probably not. Usually one event for each. So I'll assume only one event of type 'R' and one of type 'P' per claim. Then can group by claim_id."

That means average time is 90000 seconds, standard deviation is 3600 seconds. So any anomaly detection can be computed if difference < (90000 - 2 or 3 times the standard deviation) or > (90000 + some multiplier)."

But maybe we can join to check if resource from events is an adjuster id? But note that in claim_events, the \"resource\" column might be different than adjuster id? Actually, our tables have adjusters table with adjuster_id and name columns. In claim_events, there's a \"resource\" field which is probably reference to something. It says \"the resource performing the activity.\" That might not necessarily match adjuster_id? We can assume that if activity 'A' then resource may be adjuster id, so we join adjusters table on resource = adjuster_id when activity='A'. But in our instructions, it's not specified."
