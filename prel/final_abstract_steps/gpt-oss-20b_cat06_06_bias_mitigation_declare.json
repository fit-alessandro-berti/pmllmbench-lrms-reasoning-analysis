    "Text": "We need to produce updated declare_model dictionary with new constraints. We need to add constraints for fairness: coexistence, response, succession, non-succession etc. We should define new activities: ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck, CheckApplicantRace (or CheckSensitiveAttribute). Also decision steps for sensitive applicants: Approve_Minority, Reject_Minority? But maybe we can just use generic decisions but ensure that if a sensitive attribute is checked then a bias mitigation check must happen before decision."

Might be simpler: coexists between ManualReview and FinalDecision when CheckApplicantRace occurs. But DECLARE constraints are pairwise; we can add coexisting constraint between ManualReview and FinalDecision."

    "Text": "Let's propose: existence: BiasMitigationCheck, ManualReview. But this may force them even when no sensitive attribute present; still okay as fairness measure ensures extra checks always performed regardless of sensitivity detection. Might be acceptable for demonstration. Coexistence: ManualReview: {FinalDecision: {...}}, BiasMitigationCheck: {FinalDecision: {...}}. Response: CheckApplicantRace: {BiasMitigationCheck: {...}}, BiasMitigationCheck: {FinalDecision: {...}}. Non-succession: from CheckApplicantRace to FinalDecision disallowed directly."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Better use succession constraint from BiasMitigationCheck to FinalDecision ensures that after bias mitigation check the next step is final decision immediately (no other tasks). That might be too strict though because there could be other tasks like RequestAdditionalInfo before final decision even after bias mitigation check? Actually typical process may have additional info request before final decision even after bias mitigation check. So better use response rather than succession for these pairs because it allows eventual occurrence later in trace not necessarily adjacent."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In DECLARE semantics, nonsuccession(A,B) means A cannot directly precede B nor B directly precede A within the same trace (i.e., no consecutive pair AB or BA). So adding nonsuccession(CheckApplicantRace, FinalDecision) will prevent direct adjacency either way which addresses risk of biased outcome right after attribute check without intermediate steps like bias mitigation check or manual review etc."
