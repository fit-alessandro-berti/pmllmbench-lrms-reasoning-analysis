The questions should focus on clarifying and improving understanding of the property onboarding process. Specifically, they should aim to: Uncover missing details Understand decision criteria Clarify roles and responsibilities Verify timing and sequencing Learn about how exceptions are handled Importantly, the questions should not involve SQL queries or implementation details; they need to be conceptual and about deepening understanding."

Assigning a dedicated property manager based on various factors. 4. Introductory call or meeting with the landlord. 5. Scheduling photographer and inspector. 6. Addressing any inspection issues. 7. Marketing the property. 8. Activating the property in systems and handling tenant screening. 9. Finalizing lease and move-in. 10. Quality checks and audits.

    "Text": "I need to create open-ended questions that encourage detailed responses. Open-ended questions typically start with words like how, why, what, describe, etc., to elicit more than yes/no answers. Categorize the questions based on the goals: Uncover missing details: Ask about aspects not fully covered, like what specific documents are required, how long steps take, or what tools are used (but keep it conceptual, not implementation). Understand decision criteria: Probe into how decisions are made, e.g., how the property manager is assigned. Clarify roles and responsibilities: Who does what? For example, whats the difference between a property coordinator and a property manager? Verify timing and sequencing: Ask about the order of events, how long each step takes, or if steps can be parallel. Learn about exceptions: How are special cases handled, like properties with unique requirements."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Brainstorm questions: 1. Missing details: What documents are typically missing or outdated, and how often does that happen? 2. Decision criteria: How do you determine which property manager to assign based on workload, specialization, etc.? What weight is given to each factor? 3. Roles and responsibilities: Can you describe the key responsibilities of the property coordinator versus the property manager? 4. Timing and sequencing: What is the typical timeline for the entire onboarding process from initial contact to property activation? Are there any steps that can be done concurrently? 5. Exceptions: How are exceptions handled, such as when a property requires special insurance or when a landlord insists on custom lease clauses? 6. More on missing details: What amenities are commonly recorded, and how are they used in the database? 7. Decision criteria: In the tenant screening process, what criteria are used to evaluate applicants, and how do you handle cases with multiple interested parties? 8. Roles: Who is involved in the marketing team, and what specific tasks do they perform? 9. Timing: How long does it usually take for the inspection and any subsequent repairs? 10. Exceptions: What happens if the inspection fails multiple times? Is there a cutoff point?"

    "Text": "Final list of questions: 1. Can you walk me through the initial document review process in more detail? What specific documents do you look for, and how do you handle cases where documents are incomplete? 2. How is the decision made to assign a particular property manager to a new property? What criteria are most important, and how do you assess a managers track record? 3. Could you clarify the roles of the different team members involved, such as the property coordinator, property manager, and compliance officer? What are their primary responsibilities in this process? 4. What is the typical sequence and timeline for the steps after the property manager is assigned, including the introductory meeting, inspection, and marketing? 5. How do you handle exceptions or special cases, like properties that need custom insurance or landlords with specific demands? 6. In the tenant screening phase, what factors influence the selection of a tenant, and how do you manage competition among applicants? 7. Can you describe how the marketing team uses the photographers images and inspectors report in creating listings? 8. What quality checks are performed at the end, and who is responsible for ensuring everything complies with regulations? 9. Are there any common delays in the process, and how do you mitigate them? 10. How does communication flow between all parties involved, and what tools do you use to track progress? (Keep it conceptual, not implementation-specific.) The user said not request any SQL queries or implementation details, so for the last one, I should avoid mentioning specific tools. Rephrase to: How is communication managed and tracked throughout the process? Aim for 5-8 questions to keep it concise. Select the best ones: 1. Uncover missing details on documentation. 2. Understand decision criteria for manager assignment. 3. Clarify roles. 4. Verify timing and sequencing. 5. Learn about exceptions. 6. Probe into tenant screening decisions. 7. Ask about inspection handling. 8. Inquire about final audits. That should cover it."
