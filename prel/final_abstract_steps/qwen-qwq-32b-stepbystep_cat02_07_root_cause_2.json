Case 2004: - Submit at 09:20, close at 10:45 on the same day (April 1). So duration is 1 hour 25 minutes. Fast. Case 2005: - Submit: April 1 09:25 - Close: April 4 14:30. ...

The multiple requests take time between each step (like waiting for customer to respond), but the log shows the insurers events.

Region Bs high complexity cases (2005) take longer than Region As (2003), so maybe regional inefficiencies."
