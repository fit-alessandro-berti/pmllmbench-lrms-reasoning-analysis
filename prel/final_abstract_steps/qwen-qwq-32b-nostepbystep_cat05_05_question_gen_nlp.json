    "Text": "Hmm, that's 20. Let me check if they cover all aspects: sourcing, logistics, quality, compliance, digital systems, environmental impact, labor, etc. Some might be redundant, but I think each is unique. Maybe rephrase a few for better clarity. Ensure they're open-ended and not yes/no. Yeah, these should work. They invite analysis and deeper exploration of the supply chain's complexities."
