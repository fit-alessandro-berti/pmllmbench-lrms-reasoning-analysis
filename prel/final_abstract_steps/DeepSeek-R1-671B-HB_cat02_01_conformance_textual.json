If inventory is sufficient, the sequence should be Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order. If inventory is insufficient, it goes directly to Cancel order  Close order. Important constraints include:\n\n- Authorize payment must come after Check inventory and before Package items.\n- Package items must come after Authorize payment and before Ship.\n- Ship order should only happen after Package items and never after Cancel.\n- Close order is always the last step."

    "Text": "Case 2:\nActivities: Receive  Check  Package  Authorize  Ship  Close. Here, the problem is that Package items occurs before Authorize payment. According to the normative process, Authorize payment should come before Package. So this is a violation. Authorizing payment after packaging doesn't make sense because payment should be confirmed before preparing the items. The steps are out of order here."

    "Text": "Case 3:\nActivities: Receive  Check  Authorize  Cancel  Ship  Close. Hmm. After Check inventory, if they proceed to Authorize payment, that suggests inventory was sufficient. But then they Cancel order, which contradicts the path. If inventory is sufficient, they shouldn't cancel. However, maybe they authorized payment and then canceled for another reason. But the main issue is that after Cancel order, Ship order occurs. According to the rules, after cancellation, fulfillment activities like Ship shouldn't happen. So Ship after Cancel is a violation. Also, canceling after Authorize payment might be a problem if the inventory check was sufficient. The normative process says that cancellation is only for insufficient inventory. But maybe there's another reason, but the process description doesn't mention that. So violating the expected path here."

    "Text": "Case 5:\nActivities: Receive  Check  Authorize  Ship  Close. Wait, they skipped Package items. The normative process requires Package items before Ship order. So missing Package is a violation. You can't ship without packaging first. So this case skips a necessary step."
