According to the normative process, Authorize payment should come before Package. So this is a violation. Authorizing payment after packaging doesn't make sense because payment should be confirmed before preparing the items. The steps are out of order here."

But then they Cancel order, which contradicts the path. If inventory is sufficient, they shouldn't cancel. However, the main issue is that after Cancel order, Ship order occurs. According to the rules, after cancellation, fulfillment activities like Ship shouldn't happen. So Ship after Cancel is a violation. Also, canceling after Authorize payment might be a problem if the inventory check was sufficient. The normative process says that cancellation is only for insufficient inventory."
