So for the first three steps, I should model them as a sequence: A -> RG -> IA. But how to structure that? Because the sequence operator takes two children. So maybe first A and RG are in a sequence, then that sequence and IA are in another sequence? Or can I have a sequence with more than two children? Wait, according to the operators, the operators take two arguments. Like ->(A, B) is a sequence of two. So if there are three steps in sequence, we need to nest them. So A -> RG would be a sequence node, then that node is followed by IA. So the first part is -> (A, -> (RG, IA))? Or maybe the first three steps are a sequence of A, RG, IA.

So perhaps the loop is modeled as a loop node with A being the sequence (SC, treatment, RDT), and B being a silent step. The loop can exit after any iteration. ... Let's proceed with that.
