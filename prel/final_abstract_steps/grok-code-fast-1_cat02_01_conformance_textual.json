    "Text": "Outlining normative process - The process begins with receiving an order. Next, inventory is checked to determine stock availability. If inventory is sufficient, the process continues with authorizing payment. After payment, items are packaged and the order is shipped, then closed. If inventory is insufficient, the process requires further steps to handle shortages."

    "Text": "Examining process constraints - Payment authorization must occur after inventory check and before packaging items. Packaging happens after payment authorization and before shipping, with shipping never following order cancellation. Closing the order is the final step, regardless of the process path, with no deviations like shipping after cancellation allowed."

Case 2 violates norms by packaging before authorizing payment and shipping after improper authorization, breaking the required sequence."

    "Text": "Reviewing case examples - Case 3 violates norms by authorizing payment after inventory check, then canceling, which contradicts sufficient inventory expectations. It further errs by shipping after cancellation, against the rule that shipping never follows cancellation, and skips packaging before shipping."
