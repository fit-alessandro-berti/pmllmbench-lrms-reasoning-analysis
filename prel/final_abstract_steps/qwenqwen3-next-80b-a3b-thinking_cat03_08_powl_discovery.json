Wait, but the LOOP operator in POWL is defined as * ( A, B ), where you execute A, then either you exit or execute B and then A again. So maybe for the TST/RT part, A is TST, and B is RT? ... So yes, exactly. So the loop structure would be * (TST, RT)."

Alternatively, maybe the IQC is part of a loop where you have a loop that includes AS and IQC. Lets see. For example, a loop where you do AS, then IQC, and if IQC fails, you loop back to AS.
