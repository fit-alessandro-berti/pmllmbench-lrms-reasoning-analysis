The root causes are: - High complexity (cases 2003 and 2005) requiring multiple requests for additional documents, which prolongs the process. - Case 2002, with medium complexity, may be affected by the region B or the resource assigned to the Request Additional Documents step, but this is less clear... it's possible that region B has slower processing, but thats not confirmed. Alternatively, maybe the root cause for case 2002 is that the Request Additional Documents is done on the same day as Evaluate, but the approval is delayed, leading to a longer overall duration."
