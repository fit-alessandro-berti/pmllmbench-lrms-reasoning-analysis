In this case, merging them into a single event with attributes from both logs would make sense. So Merged Event3 is at 05:00Z and includes user=u45 from System Bs Shipping.

Unmerged Events: Payment Processed in A remains separate as no corresponding event within tolerance except Quality Check later on but different action. Quality Check is only present in B for this order, so added separately with its own timestamp. Item Delivered exists only in A and thus added separately. This approach integrates both logs into a single timeline where possible, enriches the events with additional attributes from System B, and includes unmerged events as per their presence in one systems log."
