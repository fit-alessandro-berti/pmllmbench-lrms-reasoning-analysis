First, I need to clearly separate the two parts: the strict rules (Part 1) that must never be violated, and the recommended best practices (Part 2) that can be ignored without serious consequences."

No issues here."

    "Text": "Case 2 jumps out immediately: - Application Received at 08:00 - But next activity is Risk Assessment at 08:20 - thats a major problem! The norm says Credit Check must come BEFORE Risk Assessment. Here they did Risk Assessment first, which violates the sequence rule. - Then Credit Check happens at 09:00 (too late, but not the main issue) - Loan Decision Rejected at 09:30 - BUT they did Finalize Documentation at 10:00 AFTER rejection! Thats explicitly forbidden - the rules say do not finalize documentation after a rejection. So Case 2 has two critical violations: 1. Risk Assessment before Credit Check (sequence violation) 2. Finalizing documentation after rejection (contradictory action)"
