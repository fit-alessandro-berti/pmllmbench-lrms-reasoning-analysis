Delivery: Order Dispatched at delivery_dispatch_date and Order Arrived at delivery_arrival_date for each delivery. Invoices: Invoice Issued at invoice_issue_date. Payments: Payment Received at payment_date. Then, for each order_id, collect all these events from all tables, sort them by timestamp, and assign the order_id as Case ID."
