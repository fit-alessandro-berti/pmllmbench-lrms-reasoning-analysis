Normative violations here are: First activity after Application Received is Risk Assessment without Credit Check first—this violates ordering rule that Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they do Credit Check after Risk Assessment which is out of order—so major violation here. Additionally, after Loan Rejected they performed Finalize Documentation which is prohibited; then closed the case."

    "Text": "After Loan Decision Rejected at 09:30 next is Finalize Documentation at 10:00—but wait where is Inform Applicant? According to normative rules, after Loan Decision must come Inform Applicant regardless of approval or rejection. In this case2 sequence: After Loan Decision Rejected comes Finalize Documentation then Close—but missing Inform Applicant activity entirely! Thats another normative violation because Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision and before closing. So skipping Inform Applicant would be violating sequence rules because you cant skip steps."

Check normative rules first: Sequence order should be Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform → Finalize Docs → Close (since approved). Yes: Application received on Jan12th; then credit check on Jan14th (but more than24h later). Then risk assessment same day as credit check; loan approved; inform applicant two days later; finalize docs next day; close case next day again. The sequence order here follows Application Received → Credit → Risk → Decision → Inform → Finalize → Close which aligns with approved path. No steps skipped or reversed here except timing issues which are part of desiderata not normative rules."

    "Text": "Now possible interpretations/justifications: For example in case3 why were there delays? Perhaps due to weekends or high workload causing delays beyond recommended times but still within permissible limits normatively. Alternatively perhaps there were external factors causing delays like waiting on third-party information etc.—acceptable reasons even though violating recommendations. For case2s credit check happening quickly despite process errors may indicate that while some steps were rushed or misordered other aspects were handled timely where possible."
