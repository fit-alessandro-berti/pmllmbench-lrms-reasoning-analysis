I need to recall what responded_existence means in DECLARE. Typically, responded_existence(A, B) means that if A occurs, then B must occur afterwards. But here, its structured with E as the key and A in activities, which might imply that if A occurs, E must occur, or vice versa. Looking at the structure, it says responded_existence: {E: {...: activities: [A]}}, so probably it means that E responded existence to A, meaning if A occurs, E must occur. I should confirm the standard DECLARE notation."
