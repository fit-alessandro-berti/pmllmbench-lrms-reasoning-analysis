Identify High Level Steps examine sequence of events per case A1 and B2 and propose set of high level activities representing logical groupings of low level steps Example Material Preparation might include retrieving raw metal sheet scanning barcode placing it on table aligning preheating 2 Justify Groupings for each high level activity defined explain why we grouped those events together temporally close same resource type etc 3 Name the High Level Activities with meaningful domain relevant names 4 Output Format return a structured representation of proposed high level activities"
