Assembly or Welding Process (picking up welding tool, performing welds on corners, then measuring weld integrity). 3. Finishing Operations (applying protective coating, drying the coating, visual inspection)."

Maybe we name them: - Step 1: Material Handling & Preparation. - Step 2: Assembly / Welding Process - Step 3: Surface Finishing & Inspection Alternatively, we can group them as: Group 1: Raw Material Preparation or simply Material Preparation Group 2: Assembly/Welding Group 3: Finishing & Quality Assurance"

    "Text": "Rationale for Groupings: - For the first group (retrieve raw metal sheet, scan barcode, place on table, align, preheat), these actions are performed at the beginning and pertain to preparing the material before further processing. The sequence is logically connected: retrieval followed by verification (scanning) then physical placement and alignment, then heat treatment for proper workability. - For the second group (pick up welding tool, weld corner A & B, measure weld integrity), these events are clearly part of an assembly or joining process where the metal sheet is welded to create joints. The welding events are sequential and require measurement of quality post-welding. - For the third group (apply protective coating, dry coating, visual check) they represent finishing processes that ensure durability and quality, including a final inspection."
