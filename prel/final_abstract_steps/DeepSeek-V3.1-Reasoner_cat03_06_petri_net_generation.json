The final marking (fm) should have a token in the closure place (or the place after closure, but well have a sink place for closed claims). However, note that the example removed the sink place. Well design with a sink place and then remove it if required? But the example also deleted the sink from the final marking. We are not required to remove the sink, so we can keep it. Lets design the net with the following places: start (initial place) after_CR after_DV after_FC after_CA after_AP (if approval is needed) OR after_CA and then bypass to a place before payment? before_P (we can call it ready_for_P) after_P after_N end (final place)"

But note: the in-depth investigation (II) is an additional step that then leads to re-doing the fraud check? However, the problem says: if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues So, after DV, if incomplete, we do RDS and then we go back to DV? Similarly, if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA). So, after FC, if doubts, we do II and then we go back to FC?"

So we can have: ... -> [DV] -> after_DV from after_DV, we have two arcs: one going to the next step (FC) if documents are complete, and one going to RDS if incomplete. Similarly, after FC, we have two arcs: one going to the next step (CA) if no doubts, and one going to II if doubts.

    "Text": "Alternatively, we can model the DV transition as having two output places: one for complete (go to FC) and one for incomplete (go to RDS). Then RDS would lead back to the input of DV (so we have a place between RDS and DV, lets call it docs_resubmitted). Similarly, for FC: FC has two output places: one for no doubts (go to CA) and one for doubts (go to II). Then II would lead back to the input of FC (so we have a place between II and FC, lets call it investigation_done). But note: the problem says the activities are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. So we are allowed to have silent transitions? The example didnt use labels for the silent transitions, but we are required to label the activities. We are going to model the decisions (whether documents are complete or not, and whether fraud check raises doubts or not) as silent transitions (with no label) or as transitions with a label? The problem doesnt specify, so we can use silent transitions for the routing."
