But note: the in-depth investigation (II) is an additional step that then leads to re-doing the fraud check? However, the problem says: if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues So, after DV, if incomplete, we do RDS and then we go back to DV? Similarly, if the Fraud Check (FC) raises doubts, an additional In-depth Investigation (II) is performed. This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA). So, after FC, if doubts, we do II and then we go back to FC?"

    "Text": "Alternatively, we can model the DV transition as having two output places: one for complete (go to FC) and one for incomplete (go to RDS). Then RDS would lead back to the input of DV. Similarly, for FC: FC has two output places: one for no doubts (go to CA) and one for doubts (go to II). Then II would lead back to the input of FC. But note: the problem says the activities are CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. So we are allowed to have silent transitions? We are going to model the decisions (whether documents are complete or not, and whether fraud check raises doubts or not) as silent transitions (with no label) or as transitions with a label? The problem does not specify, so we can use silent transitions for the routing."

For the loops, we need two more places: p_incomplete (between the incomplete silent transition and RDS) and p_doubts (between the doubts silent transition and II). For the document part: p2 to DV to p3; p3 to silent_incomplete to p_incomplete to RDS to p2; p3 to silent_complete to p4. For fraud: p4 to FC to p5; p5 to silent_doubts to p_doubts to II to p4; p5 to silent_no_doubts to p6. We will create the silent transitions without labels. For approval: p6 to AP to p8; p6 to skip_approval to p8. So we do not need p7. The final list of places is: start, after_CR (p1), before_DV (p2), after_DV (p3), before_FC (p4), after_FC (p5), after_CA (p6), after_approval (p8), after_P (p9), after_N (p10), end, p_incomplete, p_doubts.

So we must have the intermediate places for the loops."
