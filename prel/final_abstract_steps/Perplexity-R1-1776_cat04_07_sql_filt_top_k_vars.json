The task involves writing a DuckDB SQL query that processes an event log to find the top K process variants based on their frequency and then returns all events from cases that belong to those top variants."

Since LIST(activity ORDER BY timestamp), if two activities have same timestamp within a case_id—order between them isn't determined here; but according to problem statement process variants are determined by sorting events within a single case by timestamp—so activities with same timestamp may lead to arbitrary ordering unless some other tiebreaker exists."
