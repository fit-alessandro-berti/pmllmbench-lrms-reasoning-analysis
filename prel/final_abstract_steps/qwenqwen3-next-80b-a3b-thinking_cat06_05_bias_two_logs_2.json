Wait, but the Protected Group is usually the one that's historically disadvantaged, so maybe LocalResident FALSE is the protected group? But maybe that's not the case here.

So Group B's process is biased because it gives an advantage to a subset of candidates based on a factor that's not job-related and may correlate with protected attributes."
