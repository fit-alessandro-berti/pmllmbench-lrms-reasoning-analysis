From the prompt, it is a Python dictionary with specific keys. Each key corresponds to different types of declarative rules, like existence, absence, precedence, etc."

  {

    "Text": "However, the users prompt says that for keys like precedence, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support and confidence. Wait, that doesnt make sense. Maybe the structure is that for each constraint type, the dictionary maps pairs of activities to their support and confidence. But the prompt says that for the keys like precedence, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support and confidence."
