    "Text": "We need to convert raw system log into a process mining event log, with at least Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp. Possibly other attributes like App, Window, etc. We must identify cases: grouping events into coherent process instances. We need to think about what constitutes a case: logical unit of user work such as editing a specific document, handling a particular email, or reviewing a certain PDF. The raw log includes multiple apps: Microsoft Word (two documents: Quarterly_Report.docx and Document1.docx), Google Chrome (email), Adobe Acrobat (PDF), Microsoft Excel (Budget)."

    "Text": "One approach: Each document (or each work object) is a case. So each distinct window (document) could be a separate case. Thus we can define case IDs based on each unique window (document). This yields 5 cases: Document1, Quarterly_Report, Email - Inbox (or Annual Meeting email), Report_Draft, Budget_2024."

    "Text": "Alternatively, we could treat each activity thread as a case: for each project maybe combine related work. For instance, the user might be preparing a quarterly report that involves editing a Word doc, referencing a PDF, using budget Excel data, and sending email. Could treat as one case (the quarterly report). But then the email is separate perhaps."
