Wait, but how to get the events? Because the query needs to return the full set of events for those cases. So maybe I need to join the grouped data with the original table?"

So I need to first group by case_id, count the events, filter those with count <=6, and then select the events from those cases. So the query would be something like: SELECT  FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT <= 6 );"

So the WHERE clause would be correct."

So if I just select all events where case_id is in the subquery, that would be correct. But maybe theres a more efficient way. For example, using a CTE (Common Table Expression) to get the case_ids first, then joining with the original table. But the current approach is straightforward and works."

Let me check if theres any edge cases. For example, if theres a case with exactly six events, its included. If theres a case with seven, its excluded. The HAVING clause handles that."
