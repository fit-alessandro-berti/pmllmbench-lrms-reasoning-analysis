The challenge is to infer meaningful cases and activities. Looking at the sequence there are multiple windows opening and closing. The user starts with Microsoft Word and Excel then switches to Google Chrome for emails back to Word for documents and finally Adobe Acrobat. Each of these windows seems like separate tasks."

Wait thats mixing two cases here. But that might not be coherent."

Moreover after the email case the user moves to Adobe Acrobat. That could be another case. So around six cases here."
