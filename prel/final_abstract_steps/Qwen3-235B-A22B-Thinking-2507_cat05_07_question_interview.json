Theyre role-playing as someone who just heard this process description in an interview, and they need to ask follow-up questions to deepen their understanding. The key here is that the questions should uncover missing details, clarify decision points, understand exceptions, and verify roles - but absolutely no technical implementation questions like SQL queries."

    "Text": "Final check Need exactly 8-10 high-impact questions covering all process stages, with emphasis on decision criteria and exceptions. The compliance audit part feels underexplored in the original description - should dedicate at least one question to that. Also must include something about cross-departmental coordination since they mention communication flows back and forth but dont specify protocols."
