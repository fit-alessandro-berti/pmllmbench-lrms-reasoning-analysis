They want me to create targeted, open-ended questions to clarify this process based on the description. The key here is that the questions should uncover missing details, clarify decision points, understand exceptions, and verify roles - but absolutely no technical implementation questions like SQL queries."

    "Text": "For the documentation phase, I wonder how they handle cases where landlords can't provide certain documents. The description says requests updates but doesn't specify timelines or escalation paths. That's a good candidate for a question. The property manager assignment seems particularly nuanced - they mention factors like workload, geography, experience, and track record. But how do they actually weigh these factors? Is there a priority system? What happens when multiple managers seem equally qualified? Ah! The inspection phase has potential pain points. What if major repairs are needed? How long does that typically delay the process? And who decides what's critical versus cosmetic? I should also probe the tenant screening complexity. The description mentions handling multiple applicants with negotiations and discounts, but doesn't explain the criteria for such decisions. Who authorizes promotional discounts? Is there a standard policy? The compliance and audit steps at the end seem crucial but vague. How frequently do leases get rejected during compliance review? What's the most common issue found?"

    "Text": "Pauses to consider exception handling The description mentions potential exceptions like special insurance or custom lease clauses, but gives no examples of how these are resolved. Real-world processes live and die by how they handle edge cases - this needs exploration."

    "Text": "Starts drafting mentally For documentation: When landlords can't provide updated documents within X timeframe, what's your escalation path? For manager assignment: How do you balance geographic specialization against manager workload when both are constrained? For inspections: Walk me through a recent case where inspection findings significantly altered the onboarding timeline. Refines approach Better to ask about concrete examples rather than hypotheticals. Can you describe a situation where... questions often yield richer answers than how would you..."

The compliance audit part feels underexplored in the original description - should dedicate at least one question to that. Also must include something about cross-departmental coordination since they mention communication flows back and forth but don't specify protocols."
