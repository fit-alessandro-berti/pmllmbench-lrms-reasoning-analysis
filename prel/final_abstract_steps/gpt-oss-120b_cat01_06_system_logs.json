So events from 09:00:00 focus Document1, typing, save, later switch back at 09:06:00, typing, save, close. So case ID maybe C1. - Case 2: Email reply about Annual Meeting. Events: switch to Chrome email, open email, scroll, click reply, typing, send, maybe close? So case ID C2. - Case 3: Review Report_Draft.pdf. Events: switch to Acrobat, scroll, highlight. So case ID C3. - Case 4: Budget_2024.xlsx update. Events: focus Excel, typing, save. So case ID C4. - Case 5: Quarterly_Report.docx executive summary. Events: focus, typing, save, close. So case ID C5. Potential also include initial focus on Quarterly_Report at 08:59:50 but no activity until later. Could be part of same case as C5."
