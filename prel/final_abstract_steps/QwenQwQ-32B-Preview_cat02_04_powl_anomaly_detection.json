    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Looking back at the POWL model there are a couple of deviations from this standard process 1 XOR choice between Check Credit and skip In the standard process checking credit is a mandatory step to ensure the customer can pay Allowing the process to skip this step is anomalous because it introduces risk the company might ship products to customers who cannot pay for them 2 LOOP around Approve Order and Issue Invoice Having a loop on these activities suggests that the process can repeatedly approve the order and issue invoices multiple times In a standard process these steps are typically performed once per order Repeating them could lead to issuing multiple invoices for the same order which is incorrect and could confuse the customer and lead to billing errors"

    "Text": "Second looping through approval and invoicing steps can cause Multiple invoices being sent to the same customer for a single order leading to confusion and potential overcharging Process inefficiency as reviewers might approve the same order multiple times incorrectly Data inconsistencies in the system making it difficult to track the true status of an order"

    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should also consider whether there are any legitimate reasons for these anomalies For example in some cases trusted customers might be exempt from credit checks but even then such exemptions should be managed carefully and not left as an optional step in the process Similarly there might be scenarios where an order needs to be revised or reapproved but these should be exception handling paths not part of the main process flow Having a loop in the main process could lead to"
