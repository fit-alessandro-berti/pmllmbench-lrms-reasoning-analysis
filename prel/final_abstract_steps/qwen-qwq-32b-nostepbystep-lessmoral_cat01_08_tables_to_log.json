Other attributes customer type from Orders Retail sales person etc But maybe thats excessive Alternatively the task says other attributes if available so perhaps include the most relevant attributes Alternatively the user might expect the invoice amount payment method etc as attributes Let me see what the users examples in the prompt suggest Wait the user wants the table to have those four columns plus any others if available So in the output the columns should be Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource and other attributes Since the user allows other attributes if available its better to include them as separate columns where applicable But to keep it manageable perhaps list the most relevant attributes in the table Since its a table the headers can have columns like Item ID Item Picked etc But that might complicate Alternatively perhaps list key attributes in the Other Attributes column as a note since markdown tables can have multiple columns but its better to structure them as separate columns for clarity Alternatively the problems example in the tasks Delivery has delivery note which can be an attribute To make it manageable perhaps have columns like Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource Item ID Quantity Carrier Delivery Note Invoice Amount Payment Method etc But this might make the table too wide Alternatively perhaps the user expects the other attributes to be included as separate columns where applicable but since the users example in the problem statements delivery table includes delivery note perhaps include those as attributes in separate columns where applicable Alternatively to keep it concise maybe the Other Attributes can be listed as a column with key value pairs but that might be messy The users instruction says Other Attributes if available any additional relevant data So perhaps include those as separate columns But since the users output format is a table perhaps include the attributes as separate columns where necessary However since this could get too many columns perhaps the user expects to see key attributes like item details carrier invoice amount etc but perhaps the user expects to see the most relevant attributes in the event log such as item id and quantity for item picking events invoice amount for invoice events etc Alternatively maybe the user just wants the required columns plus any relevant attributes To avoid overcomplicating perhaps just include the resource and the necessary attributes as needed Let me try to structure the table with the following columns Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource Additional Attributes as a note column but perhaps better to have separate columns Alternatively since its a table perhaps include columns like Item ID for item events Carrier for delivery Invoice Amount for invoice etc However this could lead to many columns The users instructions do not specify so perhaps best to include key attributes as separate columns where applicable But given the example tables perhaps the key attributes are For Item Picked item id quantity For Order Dispatched and Order Arrived carrier name from carrier id mapping via Resources and delivery note For Invoice Issued invoice amount invoice id though maybe invoice id isnt necessary as its linked to the invoice but maybe include as an attribute For Payment Received payment method payment reference The case ID is already the order id so the invoice and payment are linked via invoice id and payment id but the case is still the order id So the final table might have columns like Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource Item ID Quantity Carrier Delivery Note Invoice Amount Payment Method Payment Reference etc But this might be too many columns Alternatively the user might expect a more minimal table with the required four columns plus some key attributes Since the user says other attributes if available its acceptable to include them as separate columns Alternatively since the problem says include any additional relevant data but the output format is a table perhaps the user expects the key attributes as separate columns where applicable However given the complexity perhaps the user expects the key attributes to be included where relevant even if that creates many columns Let me try to structure it with the following columns Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource Item ID Quantity Carrier Delivery Note Invoice ID Invoice Amount Billing Person Payment Method Payment Reference But this might be too much Alternatively just include the most important attributes as separate columns but the problems example for the Delivery table has delivery note so perhaps include that in the delivery events Similarly invoice amount as an attribute for invoice events payment method for payment events Alternatively since the problems sample tables have some attributes perhaps include the most relevant Let me proceed step by step for each event"
