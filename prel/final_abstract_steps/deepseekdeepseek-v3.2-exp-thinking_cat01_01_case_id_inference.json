Start with Patient A: age 45, gender M - Event 1: Register patient in ER - Event 4: Initial triage in ER - Event 7: X-ray imaging in Radiology (likely for ER patient) - Event 12: Doctor consultation in ER (diagnosis: hairline fracture) - Event 15: Patient discharged from ER That seems like a complete journey for an ER patient with a fracture."

    "Text": "I should confirm if any event is missing or if theres overlap. Event 12 is for age 45, which I have in Case 1, and Event 11 is for age 62, in Case 2. Event 6,9,13,16,18 are for age 28, in Case 3. Also, note that Event 10 is Lab test completed for age 62, which follows Event 8 Lab test requested, so it should be in Case 2. Similarly, Event 7 X-ray for age 45 should be after initial triage and before doctor consultation, which matches."
