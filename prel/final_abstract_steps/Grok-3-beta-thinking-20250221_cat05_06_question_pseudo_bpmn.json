    "Text": "Starting from the beginning: There's a start event, followed by conducting market research, then R&D to design a smartphone prototype. After that, there's a parallel gateway splitting into four tasks for securing components from different countries: microprocessors from Taiwan, camera modules from Japan, OLED screens from South Korea, and sensors and memory from Germany and the USA. These are all happening in parallel, which makes sense because they are independent tasks."

There, the smartphones are assembled in a 24/7 operation. After assembly, there's an exclusive gateway for quality checks and diagnostics. If the smartphones pass, they continue to packing and labeling; if they fail, they go back to assembly for rework or are scrapped."
