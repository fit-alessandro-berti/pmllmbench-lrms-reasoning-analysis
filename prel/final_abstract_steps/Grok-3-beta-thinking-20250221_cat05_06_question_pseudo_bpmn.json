    "Text": "Starting from the beginning: There's a start event, followed by conducting market research, then R&D to design a smartphone prototype. After that, there's a parallel gateway splitting into four tasks for securing components from different countries: microprocessors from Taiwan, camera modules from Japan, OLED screens from South Korea, and sensors and memory from Germany and the USA. These are all happening in parallel, which makes sense because they are independent tasks.\n\nOnce all components are secured, there's a parallel gateway joining them, and then the components are shipped to an assembly plant in Malaysia. There, the smartphones are assembled in a 24/7 operation. After assembly, there's an exclusive gateway for quality checks and diagnostics. If the smartphones pass, they continue to packing and labeling; if they fail, they go back to assembly for rework or are scrapped.\n\nAfter packing and labeling, there's another parallel gateway splitting into two tasks: air freight to high-demand markets and cargo ship to other markets. These are parallel again, meaning both shipping methods are used simultaneously for different markets.\n\nThen, there's a parallel gateway joining them, followed by customs clearance and regulatory compliance. After that, the smartphones are received at regional distribution centers in Europe, North America, Asia, and Latin America.\n\nFrom there, another parallel gateway splits into four tasks: local warehousing and break-bulk, distributing to retailers, fulfilling e-commerce orders, and direct shipments for VIP/pre-orders. These are all happening in parallel as well.\n\nAfter all distributions are done, there's a parallel gateway joining them, followed by monitoring inventory and sales forecasts. Then, there's an exclusive gateway: if demand changes, adjust orders to suppliers; if stable, proceed to the next sales cycle. Finally, there's an end event."
