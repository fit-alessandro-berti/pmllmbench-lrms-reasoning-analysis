The process must follow a strict sequence: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved or Rejected) → Inform Applicant → If Approved: Finalize Documentation → Close Case. Additionally, there are ordering rules: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, If Approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case, If Rejected, do not Finalize Documentation before Close Case."

This case follows the sequence perfectly. Credit Check before Risk Assessment, Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, Inform Applicant after Loan Decision, and since it's approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case. No violations here."

Here, there are two violations: Risk Assessment is performed before Credit Check, which violates the ordering rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. After the Loan Decision is Rejected, Finalize Documentation is performed, which is not allowed. The process should close the case without finalizing documentation."

In this case, the sequence is followed correctly: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. However, there are desiderata violations: Credit Check happened more than 24 hours after Application Received, Inform Applicant happened later than 48 hours after Loan Decision, No Follow-up Call was made before closing the case. These are not severe violations but represent suboptimal behavior."
