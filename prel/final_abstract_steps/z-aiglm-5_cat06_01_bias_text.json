Discuss whether this bias is justifiable or problematic. 3. Consider the implications of subtly favoring certain non-legally protected groups. 4. Consider the impact on fairness and equity for all applicants."

Business strategy: Focusing on a local market they understand better. Not illegal yet... Problematic (The Ethical/Fairness View): Proxy Discrimination: Favoring local residents or specific clubs can be a proxy for race, ethnicity, or socioeconomic status... Transparency: Hidden adjustments are ethically dubious. Confirmation Bias in Humans (Step 4)..."
