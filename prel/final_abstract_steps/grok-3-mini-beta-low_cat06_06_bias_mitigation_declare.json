But since DECLARE doesn't directly handle conditions, I'll assume activities like \"FinalDecision\" and \"ManualReview\".\n\n2. **Response:** Ensure that after a sensitive attribute check, a BiasMitigationCheck must precede any decision.\n\n3. **Non-succession:** Prevent direct succession from CheckApplicantRace to Reject."
