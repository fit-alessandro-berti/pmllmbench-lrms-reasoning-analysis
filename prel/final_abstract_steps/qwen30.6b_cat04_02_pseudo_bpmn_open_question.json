    "Text": "The key here is to optimize each part Lets start with automation Automation can mean using existing systems to handle repetitive tasks For example checking if a request is standard or custom Maybe existing systems can be integrated with APIs to check these types automatically Also maybe using machine learning to predict which tasks are likely to be non standard"

    "Text": "Next dynamic resource allocation How can we manage when to allocate resources Maybe having a pre emptive system that prioritizes tasks with higher priority For instance if a request is non standard the system can queue it and assign resources to handle it when theres capacity Also maybe using a queue system to handle different tasks in parallel"

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Predictive analytics could be integrated into the system By analyzing historical data the system can identify patterns in request types For example if a certain type of request is predicted to take longer the system can route it to a different task or have it processed in parallel This would reduce delays"

    "Text": "Now looking at the tasks The current structure has multiple paths Maybe each path can be optimized For example in the If Type Standard path maybe having a check for resource availability If theres a lot of parallel checks that could be automated Also if a custom path is needed the system could check if theres a resource available in parallel"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In terms of performance automation reduces manual intervention so tasks like checking requests can be done automatically Predictive analytics might reduce delays by anticipating when tasks need to be handled Dynamic resource allocation ensures that when theres a lot of work resources are allocated optimally which can save time"
