However, the problem says \"ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp\". So if timestamps are the same, the order between them is not specified, but the ROW_NUMBER() would assign different numbers, leading to different sequences. But perhaps the problem assumes that timestamps are unique per case. If not, then the ROW_NUMBER() may not be the best choice. Alternatively, RANK or DENSE_RANK? But the problem says \"ordered sequence\", so perhaps the exact order when timestamps are equal is not important, but the user expects that the order is by timestamp, so using ROW_NUMBER() with the ORDER BY timestamp is correct. Even if two have same timestamp, the order in the row number is arbitrary but consistent. So that's acceptable."
