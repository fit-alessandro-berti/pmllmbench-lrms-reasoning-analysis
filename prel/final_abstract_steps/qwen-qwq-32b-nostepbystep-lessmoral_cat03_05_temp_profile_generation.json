    "Text": "Starting with the direct pairs 1 SS OP Supplier selection to placing the order Maybe the average time is a few days Lets say 3 days 386400 STDEV could be a day 243600 So 259200 86400 Wait but maybe in seconds Let me compute 3 days is 386400  259200 seconds STDEV could be 86400 1 day or less Maybe 24 hours 86400 Hmm Maybe even 12 hours Not sure but lets go with those numbers for now 2 OP RC Order placement to receiving The lead time from ordering to receiving This could be a week maybe Lets say average 7 days 604800 seconds STDEV could be a few days Maybe 2 days 172800 So 604800 172800 3 RC QI Receiving components and then inspecting them Probably the inspection is done soon after receiving Maybe a day or two Lets say average 2 days 172800 and stdev 1 day 86400 4 QI CA After inspection assembly Lets say the assembly starts immediately after inspection is done Maybe 1 day 86400 3600 1 hour Maybe the inspection might take some time but perhaps the assembly starts as soon as the parts are approved Hmm maybe average 24 hours 86400 with low stdev like 12 hours 43200 Or maybe the assembly starts right away so the average could be shorter Maybe 12 hours 43200 average stdev 6 hours 21600 Not sure but Ill pick some numbers 5 CA PT Assembly to testing Testing usually follows assembly Maybe same day Maybe 8 hours 28800 seconds average stdev 4 hours 14400 6 PT PK Testing to packaging After testing packaging Maybe a few hours Lets say average 4 hours 14400 and stdev 1 hour 3600 7 PK WS Packaging to storage Maybe immediately so average 1 hour 3600 stdev 05 hours 1800 8 WS DT Storage to distribution This might have a variable delay depending on stock and demand Suppose the average is a few days Lets say 5 days 432000 seconds stdev 2 days 172800 9 DT AS Distribution to after sales After sales might start immediately once distributed but perhaps theres a slight delay Maybe a day or so Lets say average 1 day 86400 stdev 12 hours 43200 Now for some non adjacent pairs Lets pick a few important ones SS to RC The time between selecting a supplier and receiving components That would be the time from SS to OP plus OP to RC The average would be 37  10 days So 864000 seconds Stdev would be sqrt32 72 days Not exactly but maybe the stdev is additive Alternatively maybe the average is 10 days stdev 3 days 259200 Hmm but Im just estimating Lets say 864000 259200 Another pair OP to QI Thats the time from placing order to Quality Inspection That would be OP to RC 7 days plus RC to QI 2 days Total 9 days So 777600 seconds but maybe the average is 9 days Stdev as sum of individual stdevs Alternatively perhaps I should think more in terms of typical real world scenarios Let me think again Wait maybe I should structure this step by step Let me consider each pair and assign plausible averages and stdevs But the user wants a representative subset so I dont have to do all Let me pick some key pairs including both adjacent and non adjacent Let me list some pairs Adjacent SS OP OP RC RC QI QI CA CA PT PT PK PK WS WS DT DT AS Then some non adjacent SS RC SS QI SS CA etc Lets pick a few Maybe SS DT from selecting supplier to distribution which would be a long period Lets say the average is 14 days 14864001209600 stdev 3 days 259200 CA DT from assembly to distribution Suppose assembly to packaging takes a few days then storage time Lets say average 10 days Maybe 864000 seconds Stdev 3 days QI WS after inspection to storage Maybe the path is QI CA PT PK WS So average could be say 3 days 259200 with stdev 1 day Alternatively perhaps I should think in terms of typical industry steps For example supplier selection to order placement might take a few days then order to receive is longer like 1 week Let me try to assign numbers step by step Let me make a table of possible pairs and their time estimates First the direct pairs SS OP Lets say average 2 days 172800 seconds since 286400 Stdev 1 day 86400 OP RC Supplier lead time Lets say 10 days 864000 s stdev 2 days 172800 RC QI Maybe the same day Or a day later Lets say 1 day 86400 stdev 05 days 43200 QI CA After inspection assembly starts Maybe next day 1 day 86400 stdev 12 hours 43200 CA PT After assembly testing Lets say same day so 12 hours 43200 stdev 4 hours 14400 PT PK Testing done packaging starts Maybe 1 day 86400 stdev 24h Wait perhaps testing and packaging are quicker Maybe PT to PK is a few hours Lets say average 6 hours 21600 stdev 2 hours 7200 PK WS Packaging to storage Maybe a day So 24 hours 86400 but maybe immediate so 1 hour Hmm maybe 12 hours 43200 average stdev 6 hours 21600 WS DT Storage to distribution The storage time might be variable Suppose on average it takes 3 days to ship once in storage So average 3 days 259200 stdev a day 86400 DT AS Distribution to after sales Probably immediate so average 0 But maybe a few days Lets say after shipping after sales starts so maybe 1 day 86400 stdev 12h 43200 Now non adjacent pairs Lets pick a few SS to RC The time from selecting supplier to receiving components Thats SS to OP 2 days plus OP to RC 10 days total 12 days So average 1286400  1036800 Stdev sqrt22 102 days So sqrt104 102 days but maybe approximate as variance Alternatively just estimate stdev as 2 days 172800 So 1036800 172800 Another pair SS to QI SS to OP 2d  OP to RC 10d  RC to QI 1d total 13 days So 1123200 sec Stdev sqrt210 1 days But maybe just stdev as 3 days 259200 Another pair SS to DT from SS to DT would be the time from SS to everything until DT Lets see SS OP 2  OPRC 10  RCQI 1  QICA 1  CAPT 1  PTPK 05  PKWS 05  WSDT 3 So total 21011105053  19 days So 1627200 sec Stdev would be higher maybe 3 days 259200 Another pair OP QI OP to RC 10d  RC to QI 1d 11 days 950400 s stdev sqrt101 days 1005 so maybe stdev 3 days Also maybe a pair like QI DT QI to DT would be QICA 1d then CA to PT 1 PT to PK 05 PK to WS 05 WS to DT 3 Total 1105053  6 days So 518400 sec stdev 15 days 129600 Another pair RC DT RC to DT includes all steps between Thats RC to QI 1d then the rest until DT QI WSDT as before So total from RC to DT would be 1 RC QI  1 QI CA  1 CA PT  05 PT PK 05 PK WS 3 WS DT total 11105053  7 days So 604800 seconds stdev say 2 days 172800 Also perhaps some pairs from early steps to later ones Lets also include a pair like SS PK the path from SS to OP 2d then OP to RC 10 RC to QI 1 QI to CA 1 CA to PT 1 PT to PK 05 Total 21011105  155 days 15586400133 but maybe average 15 days 1296000 sec stdev 4 days 345600 Another pair QI PK QI to CA 1d CAPT 1 PTPK 05 total 25 days So 216000 sec 2586400216000 Wait 86400 per day 25 days is 216000 Stdev maybe 05 days 43200 Also maybe a pair like DT AS is adjacent already covered Let me also include a pair like SS DT as before Another pair SS PK the time from SS to PK would be the full process up to packaging Lets see SS to OP2 OP to RC10 RC to QI1 QI to CA1 CA to PT1 PT to PK05 total 21011105  155 days average 155 86400 1339200 STDEV maybe 3 days 259200 Alternatively perhaps some steps have longer or shorter times Wait perhaps some steps like WS to DT could have a longer stdev because storage time might vary more Like maybe the WS to DT could have a higher stdev if they wait longer Lets say 3 days average but stdev 5 days 432000 seconds Wait but in my previous estimate I had 3 days with stdev 1 day Maybe thats okay Another pair CA AS Thats a long path CA to PT 1 PT PK 05 PK WS 05 WS DT 3 DT AS 1 So total 5 days So average 432000 stdev maybe 2 days 172800 Another pair thats not adjacent RC DT as before Maybe also OP DT OP to DT includes OPRC 10 RCQI 1 etc So total 10111105053  165 days So 16586400  1425600 stdev 4 days 345600 Alternatively maybe some pairs between earlier steps For example SS CA SS to CA is SS to OP 2  OP to RC 10  RC to QI 1  QI to CA 1 total 14 days 1486400  1209600 Stdev sqrt22 102 12 12 sqrt126 112 days stdev 3 days 259200 Alternatively just estimate stdev as a fraction of the average Maybe the stdev is like 20 of the average For example if average is 12 days stdev 24 days 208800 But maybe thats too much The stdev is a standard deviation so for each steps variance adds If each step has their own stdev the total stdev would be sqrtsum of variances But maybe its too complex Since Im just estimating I can approximate Alternatively for non adjacent pairs their stdev could be the sum of individual stdevs divided by something But perhaps its okay to just assign numbers as long as they make sense Now compiling some of these into the dictionary The user wants a subset so maybe 10 15 pairs Let me choose a few more SS DT SS to DT would be all steps up to DT The average would be SS to DTs path Let me compute again SS to OP 2 OP to RC 10 RC to QI 1 QI to CA 1 CA to PT 1 PT to PK 05 PK to WS 05 WS to DT 3 total 21011105053  19 days So average 19864001658 880 Stdev maybe 4 days 345600 Another pair like SS PK as before Also maybe some pairs that are not so far but not adjacent Like SS PK as before Alternatively maybe include a pair like SS AS which is the entire process But that might be too far but maybe Alternatively let me pick the following pairs 1 SS OP 2 days 172800 86400 2 OP RC 10 days 864000 172800 3 RC QI 1 day 86400 43200 4 QI CA 1 day 86400 43200 5 CA PT 1 day 86400 43200 6 PT PK 05 days 43200 14400 Wait PT to PK is 05 days 12h so 43200 sec Stdev could be 12 hours 432002  21600 Hmm maybe 14400 4 hours as stdev Alternatively for short steps like PT to PK which is 05 days 43200 seconds maybe stdev is smaller like 025 days 21600 Let me adjust the PT PK to 43200 21600 Similarly PK to WS 05 days so 43200 s stdev 12 hours 43200 seconds 05 days is 43200 so maybe stdev 02 days 17280 Not sure but let me set it as 43200 21600 Now non adjacent pairs SS RC 210  12 days 1036800 1286400 stdev sqrt210 days sqrt104 102 but lets just say stdev 3 days 259200 SS DT 19 days 1627200 sec stdev 4 days 345600 CA DT CA to DT is CAs path to DT CA to PT 1d PT PK 05 PK WS 05 WS DT 3 total 5 days 432000 seconds so average 5 432000 586400432000 stdev maybe 2 days 172800 Another pair OP WS OP to WS OP to RC 10d  RC to QI 1d  up to WS Lets see OP to WS OPRC 10d RCQI 1 QICA 1 CAPT 1 PTPK 05 PKWS 05 total 13 days So 1386400  1123200 stdev 3 days 259200 Another pair SS AS the entire process to AS So total from SS to AS is the full 191 since DT to AS is 1 day So 20 days 1728000 stdev 4 days 345600 Alternatively maybe include that pair as well But the user wants a representative subset so maybe 15 entries Let me pick around 10 12 pairs Alternatively let me list them Direct pairs adjacent SSOP OPRC RCQI QICA CAPT PTPK PKWS WSDT DTAS Non adjacent SS RC SS DT SS WS RC DT OP DT CA DT QI WS etc Let me pick 10 12 pairs Lets see 1 SS OP 2 days stdev 1d 172800 86400 2 OP RC 10d stdev 2d

non adjacent 10 SS RC 12d 1036800 259200 3d stdev 11 SS DT 19d 1658880 1986400 Let me calculate 1986400 1986400  1641600 Wait 8640019  1641600 Stdev 4 days 345600 12 RC DT lets say 10 RC to QI  Wait from RC to DT RC to DT path RC to QI 1d QI to CA 1 CA to PT 1 PT PK 05 PK WS 05 WS DT 3 total 11105053 7 days So 786400  604800 Stdev maybe 15 days 129600 13 QI DT QI to DT QI to CA 1 then the rest gives 6 days as before So 1 day added to the previous total 7 days Wait from QI to DT is 1105053 6 days So 686400518400 stdev 15d 129600 Another pair SS CA SS to CA SSOP 2 OPRC 10 RCQI 1 QICA 1 total 14 days 1209600 sec stdev 3 days 259200 Alternatively include that one Wait maybe the user wants to have a good mix of both direct and non adjacent pairs Also perhaps a pair like SS PK SS to PK is SS

Another pair WS AS WS to DT 3d plus DT to AS 1d total 4d So WS AS would have 4 days 345600 but since those steps are adjacent maybe thats already in the adjacent pairs Alternatively maybe include a
