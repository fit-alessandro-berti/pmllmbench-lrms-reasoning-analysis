However, note that sometimes multiple items are picked at different times. We have two options: a) Create one event per item pick (with the same activity name but different timestamps and possibly different resources). b) Aggregate all item picks for an order into one event (using the latest or earliest time?). Since the problem says produce one event per activity if it’s meaningful, or summarize if appropriate, and we have individual timestamps and picker_id for each item, it is meaningful to have one event per item pick. However, note that sometimes an order might have multiple items picked at the same time? But here they are at different times. We'll create an event for each row in the Order Lines table with activity Item Picked."
