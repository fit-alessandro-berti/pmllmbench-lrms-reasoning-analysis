    "Text": "First, Ill carefully reread the normative description to make sure I understand all the rules. The key points are: - Process always starts with Receive order - Must check inventory before any payment authorization or fulfillment - If inventory sufficient: Receive → Check → Authorize Payment → Package → Ship → Close - If inventory insufficient: Receive → Check → Cancel → Close - Critical constraints: - Authorize payment only after Check inventory and before Package - Package only after Authorization and before Ship - Ship only after Package and never after Cancel - Close must be final activity"

    "Text": "Case 1: - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Package → Ship → Close - This matches the sufficient inventory path perfectly. All constraints satisfied. No violation."

    "Text": "Case 2: - Sequence: Receive → Check → Package → Authorize → Ship → Close - Problem: Package comes before Authorize Payment. The description says Package items should only occur after authorization. Here they packaged before authorizing payment - thats a clear violation. - Also, since they packaged before authorization, this might imply payment wasnt properly checked before preparing items. But the main violation is the sequence order."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3: - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Cancel → Ship → Close - Big problem: They canceled the order but then shipped it. The description explicitly states Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation. Here they canceled (after authorization) but then shipped - thats a major violation. - Also, cancellation should lead directly to Close, but they did Ship after Cancel. This is a critical error."

    "Text": "Case 5: - Sequence: Receive → Check → Authorize → Ship → Close - Missing Package items activity entirely. The description says Package items must come before Ship order (since items must be prepared before shipping). - This violates the rule that Ship order should only occur after packaging. They shipped without packaging - thats a clear violation."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now Ill double-check for any ambiguities I might have missed: - For Case 2: The description says Package items should only occur after authorization, so packaging before authorization is definitely wrong. - For Case 3: The cancellation sequence must end with Close, but they added Ship after Cancel - the description says once canceled, it would be illogical to continue with fulfillment activities, so Ship is clearly wrong. - For Case 5: The description specifies Package items as a required step before shipping. Missing it violates the process."

    "Text": "I think that covers all cases. Cases 2, 3 and 5 have violations while 1 and 4 are correct. Let me confirm the violations again: - Case 2: Package before Authorize (should be Authorize before Package) - Case 3: Ship after Cancel (should not ship after cancellation) - Case 5: Ship without Package (must package before shipping) The user also asked to interpret ambiguities - but in this case, the description seems clear about the sequence requirements. No need for creative interpretation here; the violations are straightforward based on the given rules."
