    "Text": "First, I'll carefully reread the normative description to make sure I understand all the rules. The key points are: Process always starts with Receive order, Must check inventory before any payment authorization or fulfillment, If inventory sufficient: Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close, If inventory insufficient: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close, Critical constraints: Authorize payment only after Check inventory and before Package, Package only after Authorization and before Ship, Ship only after Package and never after Cancel, Close must be final activity"

    "Text": "Now I'll go through each case one by one, comparing against these rules. Case 1: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This matches the sufficient inventory path perfectly. No violation. Case 2: Sequence: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Problem: Package comes before Authorize Payment. The description says Package items should only occur after authorization. that's a clear violation. Case 3: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. Big problem: They canceled the order but then shipped it. The description explicitly states Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation. that's a major violation. Case 4: Sequence: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This matches the insufficient inventory path exactly. All good, no violation. Case 5: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Missing Package items activity entirely. The description says Package items must come before Ship order. This violates the rule that Ship order should only occur after packaging. that's a clear violation."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now I'll double-check for any ambiguities I might have missed. For Case 2: The description says Package items should only occur after authorization, so packaging before authorization is definitely wrong. For Case 3: The cancellation sequence must end with Close, but they added Ship after Cancel, the description says once canceled, it would be illogical to continue with fulfillment activities, so Ship is clearly wrong. For Case 5: The description specifies Package items as a required step before shipping. Missing it violates the process. I think that covers all cases. Cases 2, 3 and 5 have violations while 1 and 4 are correct. Let me confirm the violations again: Case 2: Package before Authorize, Case 3: Ship after Cancel, Case 5: Ship without Package."
