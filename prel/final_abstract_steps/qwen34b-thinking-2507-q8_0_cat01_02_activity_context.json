    "Text": "First, I'll scan through the log to spot recurring activities. Hmm... Verify Documents appears in three cases (C001, C002, C003) but with different contexts each time. That's definitely a candidate for renaming. Also Call Customer shows up multiple times across cases - seems like it might need clarification too."

    "Text": "Looking at C001 specifically: - First Verify Documents is about checking identity docs (initial verification) - Then later Verify Documents happens after customer uploads ID scan - so this is a re-verification step The context column says Agent checks identity documents vs Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided - ah! So the first is initial verification, the second is re-verification after new docs are submitted."

    "Text": "For Call Customer in C001: it's about requesting missing docs (outbound call for missing information). In C002, it's for clarifying account discrepancies, and in C003 it's to have a customer return after stepping out. So the call purpose varies: missing docs, clarification, and follow-up."

For Verify Documents repetitions: - Initial verification maybe Initial Document Verification - Re-verification Re-Verify Documents or Document Re-Verification For Call Customer: - When requesting missing docs Request Missing Documents - When clarifying discrepancies Clarify Account Discrepancy - When follow-up Confirm Adjustments (since C002 has follow-up call to confirm adjustments)"

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, in C003 the call is to have them return - so maybe Request Customer Return for that specific case? But the user wants general naming patterns. Better to make the names descriptive enough to cover the context without being case-specific."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But the problem says rename the activities - meaning the activity name itself changes to be context-aware. So in the revised log, the activity name should be different for each instance based on context. Yes, that makes sense. So the activity name itself changes per row to be context-specific."
