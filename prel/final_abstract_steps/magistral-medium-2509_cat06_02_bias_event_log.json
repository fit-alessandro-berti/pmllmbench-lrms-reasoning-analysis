For example, C003 has a score of 715 without adjustment and is rejected, but C004 has a base score of 690 and with +10 gets to 700 and is approved. So someone with a higher base score (715 vs 690) is rejected while someone with a lower base score is approved because of the community adjustment. That seems unfair. The community adjustment is giving an advantage to members of that club."
