So maybe that first FOCUS is part of a separate case? Or perhaps it's part of preparing but didn't result in any activity beyond that. Alternatively, maybe the user opened Quarterly_Report first but then switched to Document1 to work on it immediately. So the Quarterly_Report case would only include the events starting from 09:07:15 onwards when they actually make changes. So grouping by the Window/Application where work is done: Case 1: Document1.docx in Word (events from 09:00:00 to 09:07:00)"

So this might be part of another case (QUARTERLY_REPORT_FINALIZE) which starts at 09:07:15. However this initial Focus doesn't have any subsequent actions until much later when they return after closing Document1 at line23 (which is after line19). So maybe this initial Focus isn't part of any active case because no actions follow immediately; instead QUARTERLY_REPORT_FINALIZE starts at line23 when they Focus again and perform Typing/Save/Close. Thus line1 would not belong to any active case since no further action occurs until later."
