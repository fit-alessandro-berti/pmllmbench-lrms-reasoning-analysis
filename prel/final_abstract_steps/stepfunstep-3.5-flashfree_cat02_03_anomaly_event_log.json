The standard sequence is typically: Create Requisition  Approve Requisition  Issue PO  Receive Goods  Receive Invoice  Match Invoice to PO  Release Payment  Close Case. Any deviations from this order or missing steps could indicate anomalies."

    "Text": "Now Case 1002 jumps out immediately. After creating the requisition, they issue the purchase order before approving the requisition. Thats a red flag because approval should come before issuing a PO. Also, payment is released before receiving goods and before matching the invoice to the POthats a major control risk. Payment without goods receipt and invoice matching could lead to paying for something not received or fraud. Then they approve the requisition after payment was already released, which is completely out of order. This case has multiple serious anomalies."

    "Text": "Case 1003 looks odd too. They issue payment before receiving the invoice and goods. Thats paying without any verification of delivery or invoicinghuge financial risk. Also, receiving goods happens after payment and after invoice receipt, which is backwards. The match happens last, so theres no threeway match PO, goods receipt, invoice before payment. This is a serious control failure."

    "Text": "Case 1004 has goods received before the purchase order is issued. Thats a problem because goods should only be received after a PO is sent to the vendor. Receiving without a PO means no authorization for the purchase, leading to unauthorized spending. Then invoice and payment happen quickly after, but the issue is the outoforder goods receipt."

    "Text": "So summarizing: Case 1002 has approval after PO issuance, payment before goodsinvoice matching. Case 1003 has payment before invoice and goods receipt, and goods received last. Case 1004 has goods receipt before PO issuance. All these break standard controls, risking fraud, errors, or financial loss."
