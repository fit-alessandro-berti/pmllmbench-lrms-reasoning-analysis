That includes understanding each step, the gateways, how paths converge or loop back, and how things differ based on whether the customer request is standard or custom.

In this case, we have a textual representation, but it's structured like a BPMN diagram with tasks, gateways, and events."

It says 'After Standard or Custom Path Tasks Completed,' but for the custom path, if it's not feasible, it goes directly to send rejection notice and end.
