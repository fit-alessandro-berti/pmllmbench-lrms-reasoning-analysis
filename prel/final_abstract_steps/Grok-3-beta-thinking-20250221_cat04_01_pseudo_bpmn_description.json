This could be an order, a query, or any kind of request that needs to be processed."

So, for standard requests, there are two checks that happen simultaneously: \"Task C1: Credit Check\" and \"Task C2: Inventory Check.\" These are likely to verify the customer's creditworthiness and whether the inventory is available for the request.\n\nOnce both parallel checks are completed, there's a join point: \"All Parallel Checks Completed (Join).\" In BPMN, this would be represented by another AND gateway that synchronizes the parallel paths. After this, the process moves to \"Task D: Calculate Delivery Date.\" So, after ensuring credit and inventory are okay, the delivery date is calculated."

If feasible, prepare a custom quotation.\n\nc. If not feasible, send a rejection notice and end the process.\n\nAfter the specific path (standard or custom), check if approval is needed.\nIf approval is needed:\na. Obtain manager approval.\n\nb.
