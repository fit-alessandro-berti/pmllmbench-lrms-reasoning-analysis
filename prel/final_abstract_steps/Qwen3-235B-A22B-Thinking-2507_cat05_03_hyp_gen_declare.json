The noncoexistence constraint states that E and C cannot coexist. So if C must occur (by existence), then E must never occur? But the intended process requires E (Evaluate) to happen before P (Approve) and then N (Notify) and then C (Close). So without E, we cannot have the intended process.

But note that the noncoexistence constraint (if we take it as valid) would prevent E from occurring at all (because C must occur and E and C cannot coexist). So in reality, E never occurs?

    "Text": "Hypotheses for why the model includes such anomalies: 1. Misinterpretation of business requirements: The modeler might have confused noncoexistence with another constraint. 2. Incremental changes in policies: Previously, the process might have been that claims are closed without evaluation. 3. Technical issues or incomplete data: The data used to mine the DECLARE model might have been from a period when a new process was being rolled out but not fully adopted. 4. Pressure to handle claims quickly: There might be a business incentive to close claims quickly, leading to cases where evaluation is skipped."

Check for claims that were closed without evaluation (violating the intended process, but consistent with the noncoexistence constraint in the model). 2. Check for claims that have both evaluation and closing (which is required by the intended process but forbidden by the noncoexistence constraint in the model). 3. Check if evaluation steps always correspond with assigned adjusters (to verify the responded_existence constraint for E requiring A)."
