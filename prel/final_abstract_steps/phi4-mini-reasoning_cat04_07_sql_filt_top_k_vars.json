Need to check. But the problem is that in SQL standard, you can't use LIMIT with a CTE like this unless it's inside a subquery or window functions. Alternatively, using ROW_NUMBER(): WITH paths AS ( SELECT case_id, STRING_AGG(activity ORDER BY timestamp ASC) AS path FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ), variant_counts AS ( SELECT path, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM paths GROUP BY path ), ranked_variants AS ( SELECT variant_path, cnt, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY cnt DESC) as rn FROM variant_counts ) Then select the variants where rn <= K."

Because in DuckDB SQL queries can't dynamically assign variables like TOP K unless using window functions or common table expressions (CTEs). Wait, perhaps the plan is: - First compute for each row in event_log (e), its path. Then aggregate over all rows: group by e.case_id's path string, count them as cnt. Select from this grouping the top K variants ordered by cnt descending. But then how do we get back to include only those case_ids whose path is among these?"

Hmm, no. Wait, recursion might not be the right approach here because we need to generate all prefixes of a case's activity sequence. For example, for each case, take its entire path as is (so level 1), then add the first two activities with an intermediate one in between (level 2), etc. But this could lead to exponential growth.

But in DuckDB, I think it's similar: ROW_NUMBER() OVER ORDER BY cnt DESC will assign rn values incrementally even with ties. For example, if variants A, B, C all have the same count of 100, then each gets a row number from 1 to K (if there are three and K=3). So in this case, any variant that is among the top K would be selected."
