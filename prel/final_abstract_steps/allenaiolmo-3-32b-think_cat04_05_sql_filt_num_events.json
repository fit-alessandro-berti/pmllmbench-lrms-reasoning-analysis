Wait, another approach could be a subquery. Let me outline the steps: 1. Find all case_ids where the count of events is <=6. 2. Select all events from the event_log where their case_id is in that list. So the structure would be something like: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 );"

    "Text": "Hmm, that seems straightforward. Let me check if that works. The subquery groups by case_id, counts the events, and only includes case_ids with count <=6. Then the main query selects all events where the case_id is in that list. That should do it."
