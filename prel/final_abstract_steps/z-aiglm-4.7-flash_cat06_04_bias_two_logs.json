    "Text": "Explain Manifestation: Attribute Influence: The CommunityGroup attribute (Highland Civic Darts Club) acts as a proxy for preferential treatment. ScoreAdjustment Role: The scoring engine/underwriter applies a rule: If CommunityGroup == Highland Civic Darts Club, add +10 to the PreliminaryScore. Decision Impact: Case U001 (720) -> +10 -> 730 -> Approved. Case U003 (695) -> +10 -> 705 -> Approved."

A 695 score in Group A -> Likely Rejected."

Nuance: Better to describe it as Affirmative Bias or Procedural Favoritism based on membership. Check: Does LocalResident matter? The boost is specific to CommunityGroup, not just Being a Local Resident. U002 despite LocalResident=TRUE, CommunityGroup=None, no boost."

Bias: Affirmative Bias / Favoritism based on Community Affiliation. Manifestation: The +10 adjustment in the ScoreAdjustment column when CommunityGroup is Highland Civic Darts Club. Self-Correction: Make sure to mention that U002, despite being a Local Resident (TRUE), does not get the boost, proving the boost is based on the Club, not residency status."
