Actually, it is just a benchmark question that instructs: Assume you have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named event_log, with each row representing a single event. The table has at least the following columns: case_id, activity, and timestamp. Each case_id groups events that belong to a single process instance (or case)."

    "Text": "Your task: Please craft a DuckDB SQL query that filters out any cases containing more than six events, and returns only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total. In other words, the query should identify the number of events per case_id, exclude any case_id where this count is greater than six, and then return the full set of events for the remaining cases. Be sure to consider the correct grouping and filtering to achieve this result. Thus our answer would be: We want a query that selects rows from event_log table where case_id satisfies having number of events <=6."
