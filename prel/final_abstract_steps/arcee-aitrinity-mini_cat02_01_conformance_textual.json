    "Text": "Okay lets tackle this problem step by step First I need to understand the normative process description and then check each case in the event log against it The normative process outlines a flow that starts with Receive order followed by Check inventory Depending on inventory there are two paths one for sufficient stock leading to Authorize payment Package items Ship order and Close order the other for insufficient stock going to Cancel order and then Close order Key constraints are that payment authorization must be after inventory check and before packaging and shipping cancellation must lead to closing the order and certain steps cant happen out of order"
