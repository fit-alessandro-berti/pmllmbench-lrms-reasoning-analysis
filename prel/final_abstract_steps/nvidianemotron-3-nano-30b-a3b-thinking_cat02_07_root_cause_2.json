    "Text": "Case 2001: from 0900 to 1030 = 1.5 hrs. Case 2002: submit 0905, close 1100 next day? Actually events: submit 0905 same day, evaluate 0945 same day, request docs 1400 same day, approve 1000 next day? Wait timestamp: 1000 on 20240402, so time gap from request to approve ~19 hrs plus earlier events. Overall from submit to close: submit 0905 day1, close 1100 day2 => ~44 hrs? Actually close at 1100 on 20240402, so about 44 hrs. Case 2003: submit 0910 day1, close 0930 day3 => ~54 hrs 20 min? Actually close at 0930 on 20240403, so about 54 hrs 20 min. Case 2004: submit 0920 day1, close 1045 same day => 1 hr 25 min. Case 2005: submit 0925 day1, close 1430 day4 => about 79 hrs 5 min."
