The xor_node has two children: successful_subtree (parallel with authorize, package, ship) and cancel_subtree (sequence of cancel_order then close_order). Then the root is a sequence of receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order.\n\nSo regardless of which path the XOR takes, after the xor_node, the root appends another Close_Order. So for the cancel path: the cancel_subtree is Sequence(Cancel, Close), then after that, the root adds another Close. So the trace would be: Receive_Order  Check_Inventory  Cancel  Close_Order  Close_Order. That's invalid because Close_Order happens twice. But maybe the model allows that.

So the model's structure introduces an extra Close_Order that shouldn't be there. That's a structural flaw.\n\nSo, the answer is likely the trace with two Close_Order events after cancel."
