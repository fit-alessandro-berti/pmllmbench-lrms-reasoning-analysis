    "Text": "Wait I could also group the quality steps together Measure weld integrity automated sensor check Visual check manual inspection But they happen at different times and check different things weld vs overall product Plus theres coating in between So they should be separate Another consideration Should Preheat metal sheet be its own step Looking at typical manufacturing processes preheating is usually part of preparation or could be a distinct Heat Treatment step But given its done right after alignment and before welding and its on the same workpiece it fits well in Material Preparation"
