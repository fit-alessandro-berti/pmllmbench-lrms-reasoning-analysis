The AND Gateway means both tasks must be done in parallel, and after both are complete, they join at the All Parallel Checks Completed point. Then Task D: Calculate Delivery Date comes next."

Highlight how the paths converge after their respective tasks into the approval step. Also, clarify the loop when approval is denied, explaining that it goes back to the quotation or delivery date steps to adjust before trying approval again. Make sure to mention the gateways clearly, their types (XOR, AND), and the conditions that trigger each path or loop."
