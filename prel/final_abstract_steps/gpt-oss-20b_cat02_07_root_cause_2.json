    "Text": "We need to analyze event log. Compute durations per case: from first to last timestamp. Lets calculate quickly. Case 2001: start 09:00, end 10:30 same day => 1h30 = 90 min. 2002: start 09:05, end 11:00 next day? Actually close claim at 2024-04-02 11:00. So duration from Apr1 09:05 to Apr2 11:00 = about 25h55? Lets compute difference. Apr1 midnight to Apr2 midnight is 24h. Add from Apr1 09:05 to midnight =14h55? Wait easier compute using python mentally? Lets approximate: Start Apr1 09:05 End Apr2 11:00 From start to end of day (Apr1) = (24-9)h -5min? Actually from9:05 to24=14h55. Then add full next day until11=11h. Total=25h55. 2003 start Apr1 09:10 end April3 close at April3 09:30. Thats two days plus some hours. From April19?? Wait compute: Start April1 at9:10 End April3 at9:30 Duration: April1 remaining after9.10 -> (24-9)=15 h minus .1667? Actually .1667 hour is .10*60=6min; so remaining ~14h50. Add full April2 (24 h) Add part of April3 until9.5 h => total ~14.833+24+9.5=48.333 hours ~48 h20 min. 2004 start4/01/0920 end same day close at1045 => duration about70 min. 2005 start4/01/0925 end4/04/14/30 => thats over three days. Compute: Apr01 remaining after9m25 -> (24-9)=15 h minus0m25? Actually .4167 hour; so remaining ~14h34m35s. Add full days Feb?? Wait we have days: Apr02 full day(24) Apr03 full day(24) Apr04 until14m30 ->14 hr30 min Total approx =14h34 +24+24+14hr30 =77hr4min (~77 hrs)."

    "Text": "Lets analyze attributes: Resources: CSR_Jane handled low complexity quickly; CSR_Paul high complexity took long due to multiple docs; CSR_Mary low complexity quick; Manager_Ann quick for low complexity but moderate for medium etc. Region A vs B differences? Case2003 region A high complexity had repeated request events on same day and next day, leading to longer time but still less than B region high complexity case which had many requests across multiple days maybe due to resource availability or backlog in region Bs adjuster Lisa who had many tasks causing delays between requests and approvals. Complexity obviously major factor because high leads more steps like additional documents etc., increasing duration significantly compared with low or medium cases that finish within a few hours/days."

    "Text": "Mitigation suggestions: - Automate document collection via digital portal reducing manual request cycles. - Assign dedicated adjusters for high-complexity claims or increase staffing in Region B where adjuster Lisa is bottlenecked. - Use parallel processing where possible e.g., while awaiting documents, other tasks can proceed such as payment preparation if partial data available. - Implement SLA thresholds per activity by complexity level; trigger alerts when waiting times exceed thresholds. - Provide training/resources for CSR_Paul & others on efficient claim intake procedures especially for complex cases. Also consider resource rotation or cross-training across regions reduce regional bottlenecks."

Use code blocks if needed show calculations table summarizing durations perhaps using markdown table format inside code block not required but okay. Lets produce final answer now."
