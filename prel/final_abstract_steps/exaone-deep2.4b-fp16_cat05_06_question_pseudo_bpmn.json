    "Text": "The process starts with market research, then R&D for the smartphone design. There's a parallel path where components from different countries are secured in parallel. After securing all components, they ship to the assembly plant in Malaysia. Then assembling occurs 24/7. The quality checks split again, leading to either rework or moving to other markets. There are distribution paths split and joined again, followed by customs clearance, warehousing, distribution to retailers, e-commerce fulfillment, and VIP shipments. Finally, inventory and sales monitoring, followed by adjusting orders based on sales data."
