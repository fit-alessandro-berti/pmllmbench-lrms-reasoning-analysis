The resolution time for each ticket would be the time from when the ticket was assigned to the agent through to closure. Since all the timestamps are given, maybe I can compute the duration between each event and the ticket being resolved. Looking at the data: Each ticket will have several events. For each case, lets see the total time from Receive to Close."
