    "Text": "Now explaining how the updated model ensures conformance The model enforces that after approving the requisition the purchase order is created followed by receiving goods then invoice then matching then paying and finally closing This ensures that each step follows the correct logical order The parallel block was causing steps to be out of order which would allow for example paying the invoice before receiving goods which is not part of the standard process By making them sequential the model ensures that each step must occur in the correct order preventing any unwanted behavior"
