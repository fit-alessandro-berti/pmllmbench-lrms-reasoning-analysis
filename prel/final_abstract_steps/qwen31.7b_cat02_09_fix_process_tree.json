The parallel block allows these steps to happen in any order, which is problematic because, for example, paying the invoice before receiving goods is not logical. Also, the order of receiving goods and receiving invoice might not make sense. The problem is that the steps after the approval are not in the correct sequence."

They should follow the sequence: create_po, then receive goods, then receive invoice, then match, then pay. But the current model allows them to be in any order, which is incorrect. - The parallel block allows all these steps to happen in any order, which is not allowed. The correct sequence must be sequential."

    "Text": "But wait, the original model has the parallel block. The current model has a parallel block with create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, pay_invoice. But thats not correct because create_po should come first, then receive_goods, then receive_invoice, etc. So the parallel block is incorrect. Instead, the correct sequence is create_po, then receive_goods, then receive_invoice, then match_invoice, then pay_invoice. So the steps after approve_req should be in a sequence, with create_po first, then the rest."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "So the correct structure is: create_req -> approve_req -> create_po -> receive_goods -> receive_invoice -> match_invoice -> pay_invoice -> close_case. Therefore, the parallel block is replaced with a sequence that follows the correct order. The original parallel block was allowing all steps to be in any order, which is wrong. The correct sequence is sequential. So the modified model would have the create_po as the first step after approve_req, followed by the rest in order. Thus, the corrected process tree would have a sequence operator with the steps in order."

    "Text": "Now, explaining how the updated model ensures conformance. The model enforces that after approving the requisition, the purchase order is created, followed by receiving goods, then invoice, then matching, then paying, and finally closing. This ensures that each step follows the correct logical order. The parallel block was causing steps to be out of order, which would allow, for example, paying the invoice before receiving goods, which is not part of the standard process. By making them sequential, the model ensures that each step must occur in the correct order, preventing any unwanted behavior."
