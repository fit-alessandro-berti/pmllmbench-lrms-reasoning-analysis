CommunityGroup: The community group the applicant belongs to (e.g., Highland Civic Darts Club) or None. PreliminaryScore: The initial credit score. ScoreAdjustment: Adjustments made to the preliminary score (e.g., +10 (Community)). ManualReview: The reviewer (if any) who performed the manual review.

In the PreliminaryScoring activity, they receive a +10 (Community) adjustment. This increases their preliminary score by 10 points. In contrast, cases C002, C003, and C005 do not belong to any community group (CommunityGroup = None) and hence receive a 0 adjustment."

The final decision was Approved. For C002: PreliminaryScore was 720, no adjustment (remains 720). Approved. For C003: PreliminaryScore was 715, no adjustment (remains 715). Rejected.

Potential Bias: The adjustment of +10 for belonging to a specific community group (Highland Civic Darts Club) introduces a bias in favor of applicants who are members of that group and are local residents.

For example: An applicant with a preliminary score of 690 and community adjustment (C004) gets approved (700), while an applicant with 715 (C003) without adjustment gets rejected. The adjustment is only available to a specific community group and local residents. This may disadvantage: Non-local residents (like C003 and C005) even if they have high scores (C005 was approved because 740 is high, but C003 with 715 was rejected). Local residents without community group affiliation (like C002) who do not get the adjustment. However, note that C002 had 720 and was approved without adjustment."

    "Text": "Conclusion on Bias: The bias manifests in the PreliminaryScoring activity where a +10 (Community) adjustment is applied to applicants who are local residents and belong to the Highland Civic Darts Club. This adjustment favors a specific community group and local residents, leading to: Higher scores for members of that group, which may result in approvals that would otherwise be rejections (as in C004). Disparate treatment for applicants with similar creditworthiness (preliminary scores) but without the community affiliation."

    "Text": "Fairness and Equity Implications: The process may be unfair to: Non-local residents (even with relatively high scores, like C003 at 715) who are rejected while a local resident with community group and a lower preliminary score (C004 at 690) is approved. Local residents who are not part of the specific community group (like C002) do not get the adjustment, but note that C002 had a high enough score (720) to be approved without it. However, if a local resident without community group had a score of 695, they would be rejected while a community group member with 690 would be approved. The adjustment is not based on individual creditworthiness factors but on group membership and geography. This may lead to systemic advantages for certain groups and disadvantages for others, potentially violating principles of equal treatment."

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Recommendation: To promote fairness, the adjustment criteria should be re-examined. If the adjustment is intended to reflect lower risk for local community involvement, then it should be available to all community groups (not just one) and perhaps with a clear, objective criterion. Alternatively, the adjustment might be removed and replaced with a more individualized assessment. Additionally, the threshold for approval should be consistently applied. The case of C003 (715 rejected) and C004 (700 approved) suggests that the adjustment might be overriding the intended risk assessment. Note: The data is limited (only 5 cases), but the pattern is clear."
