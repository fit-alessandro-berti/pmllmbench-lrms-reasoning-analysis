    "Text": "Everything seems to fit nicely The departments and activities align with what youd expect for each patients journey For example the 28yearold male is in the Surgery department throughout his journey which makes sense given the surgeryrelated activities The other two cases are in the ER department which aligns with their activities like triage lab tests and consultations One thing to note is that the 45yearold males journey includes an Xray which is consistent with the diagnosis of a hairline fracture Event 12 The 62yearold females journey includes lab tests and a prescription for antibiotics consistent with a minor infection diagnosis Event 11 The 28yearold males journey is all about surgery from preparation to recovery There are no overlapping events or attributes that would suggest any mixing between the cases Each case has a unique combination of age gender and department trajectory"
