    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",

    "Text": "Now, the second part: explaining why this trace is problematic. The domain requires sequential execution of authorize, package, and ship. Parallel execution would mean all three happen at the same time, which could lead to inconsistencies, like if ship is done before authorization is confirmed, or if there's a race condition."
