In C003: \"Call Customer While Waiting\" or \"Call Customer for Return\". For \"Verify Documents\" in C001 first time: \"Verify Initial Documents\" or \"Initial Document Verification\". Second time: \"Re-Verify Documents\" or \"Recheck Documents\". In C002's Verify Documents: \"Verify Initial Documents\" as well, but maybe \"Verify Identity Documents\" since it's part of identity verification. In C003's first Verify Documents: \"Verify Physical Documents\" since it's done by a branch officer and involves physical checks. The second Verify Documents after adjustment could be \"Re-Verify Documents After Adjustment\". For \"Adjust Account\" in C002: \"Adjust Account Details\" or \"Modify Account Information\". In C003: \"Correct Account Information\" or \"Adjust Account Due to Missing Info\"."
