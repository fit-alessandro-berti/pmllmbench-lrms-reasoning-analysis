Group cases by their sequence (variant) and count how many cases have each variant. 3. Identify the top K variants by their count. 4. Retrieve all events from the original log that belong to these top K cases."

Alternatively, the subquery approach: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT cs.case_id FROM case_sequences cs WHERE cs.activity_sequence IN (SELECT activity_sequence FROM variant_counts WHERE rank <= K) ) Either approach works.

The ROW_NUMBER() will assign a rank based on the order of their counts, so the first one encountered would have a lower rank, but thats an issue. But since the ORDER BY is by COUNT(*) DESC, then the ROW_NUMBER() will order first by the highest count, so if two sequences have the same count, the first one is rank 1, the next same count would get rank 2, but in the case of ties, the rank would increment even though counts are the same."
