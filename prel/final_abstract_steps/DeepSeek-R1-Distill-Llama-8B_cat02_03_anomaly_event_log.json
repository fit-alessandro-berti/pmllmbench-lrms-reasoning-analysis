Then on 2/2, they receive goods, get the Vendor Invoice, then on 2/5, Match Invoice to PO, 2/6 Release Payment, and Close on 2/7. That seems standard."

    "Text": "Case 1002 is interesting. It starts on 2/1 with Create and Issue Purchase Order on the same day, but then on 2/3, it gets the Vendor Invoice, releases payment, and on 2/4 receives goods. Wait, that seems off."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Normally, you'd receive goods after the purchase order is issued, and the invoice is matched after the goods are received. But here, the Vendor Invoice is received before the goods are received. That might be a problem because the vendor shouldn't send an invoice until the goods are delivered and accepted."

    "Text": "Also, the Approve Purchase Requisition is done on 2/3, after the Vendor Invoice was received. That's another issue because you shouldn't approve the requisition until after the purchase order is issued and goods are received."

  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "That seems odd because usually, the Vendor Invoice comes right after the goods are received. Here, it's a day later. Also, the payment is released on 2/8, but the invoice is received a day later."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "You typically issue the purchase order before receiving goods, but here it's after. Also, the Invoice is received after the goods are received but before the payment is released. That might not be a problem, but the PO was issued after receiving goods, which is unusual."

    "Text": "Let me recap the potential issues: Case 1002: Vendor Invoice received before goods received. Also, Approve Purchase Requisition after receiving the invoice, which is not standard. Case 1003: Vendor Invoice comes after receiving goods, but payment is released before the invoice is received. Also, the PO was issued before receiving goods, but the invoice is after goods, which is okay, but the payment is released before the invoice is matched. Case 1004: Issuing PO after receiving goods. That's a major issue because the PO should be used to order goods, and goods should be received after the PO is issued. Here, goods were received before the PO was created, which could mean the PO wasn't used properly."
