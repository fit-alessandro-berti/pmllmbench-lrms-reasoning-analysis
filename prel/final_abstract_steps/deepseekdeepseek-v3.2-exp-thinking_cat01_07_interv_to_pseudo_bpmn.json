    "Text": "First, I need to identify the core process flow from the interviews. Mary's account gives the clearest sequence: Receive Invoice  Check PO  Log Invoice  Confirm Receipt  Match Invoice/PO  Manager Approval  Schedule Payment. The other interviews add nuances: Dan clarifies Purchasing' role in confirmation, Carlos explains manager approval triggers, Rita handles exceptions, and Karen supports supplier issues."

    "Text": "The main challenge is consolidating exception paths. Rita mentions escalation to supervisor and non-PO invoices, while Karen describes supplier resolution loops. These should be modeled as alternate flows branching from relevant decision points."

    "Text": "For roles, I'll map each task to the responsible party based on the interviews. The textual format should use clear indentation and labels (Start/End/Activity/Gateway) to make it diagram-ready. Ambiguities like some cases in the supplier contact step should be explicitly noted."
