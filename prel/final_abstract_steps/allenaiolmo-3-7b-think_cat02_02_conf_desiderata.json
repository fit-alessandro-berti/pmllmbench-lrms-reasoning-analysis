    "Text": "Now the user also asks for suggestions or justifications where possible Lets think about possible justifications For Case 2s Credit Check after Risk Assessment the process must strictly follow the sequence so theres no justification here Its a clear violation of the normative rules For the finalization after rejection in Case 2 the rule is explicit that if rejected you cant finalize before closing They did finalize before closing so thats a clear violation Case 3s Credit Check delay while the strict rules dont require a time limit the desiderata do The user might argue that the Credit Check was delayed due to an external factor like waiting for additional data but the process still followed the sequence However the normative rules dont allow for such delays in the sequence only the timing is a desideratum For the inform applicant in Case 3 being late again the strict rules dont require a time limit so the delay isnt a normative issue but its against the recommendation Maybe the system was overwhelmed or the decision took longer than expected but the process steps were followed correctly Followup call in all cases the desiderata recommend it but its not mandatory So in cases where its missing its just a best practice not enforced by rules So for justifications where possible perhaps in Case 3s Credit Check delay one could argue that the Credit Check was pending external data like a background check taking longer but the normative rules dont require that to be within a specific time However the user might still consider that a desideratum violation even if theres a reason Putting this all together the answers would be structured as 1 Normative violations Case 2 has two violations order and finalization after rejection Case 3 has none 2 Desiderata violations Case 1 missing followup call Case 2 missing followup call Case 3 Credit Check late inform applicant late no followup call Then for justifications where applicable like for Case 3s Credit Check delay but since the question says when possible perhaps only where theres ambiguity In this case the normative rules dont have time constraints so the delays in Credit Check and inform are just desiderata not normative So maybe no need for justifications unless the user wants to explain why certain things are considered violations or not So final answer would list each cases violations in each category explain why and note any justifications where applicable"
