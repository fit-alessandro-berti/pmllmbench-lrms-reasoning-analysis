    "Text": "Starting with Group A: All the applications have LocalResident as FALSE. There are no entries in CommunityGroup except None. Their PreliminaryScores range from 710-740, and they get approved or rejected based on these scores without any adjustments mentioned. So, it seems like their decisions are purely based on their initial scores."

    "Text": "Now, Group B has LocalResident as TRUE for all cases. Some have CommunityGroup entries, like Highland Civic Darts Club. Here's the thing: when a case is part of that community group, there's a +10 ScoreAdjustment called Community Boost. For example, U001 had an initial score of 720 and got boosted to 730, which led to approval. Similarly, U003 started at 695 but was approved after the boost. Meanwhile, U002 didn't have a community group, so no adjustment, leading to rejection."

    "Text": "So the bias seems to be that Group B members who are local residents and part of certain community groups get their scores artificially increased, improving their chances of approval compared to those in Group A or even other Group B applicants without community connections. This creates a disparity where being both a local resident and part of a specific group gives an advantage not present for the protected group."
