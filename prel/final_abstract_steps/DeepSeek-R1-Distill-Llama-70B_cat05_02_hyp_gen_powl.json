    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "To verify the hypotheses, I determined that I need to query the database for: occurrences of repeated E or P events (loop anomaly), skipped N events (XOR anomaly), and premature C events (partial ordering anomaly)."

    "Text": "The SQL query plan involves: 1) identifying multiple E or P events using COUNT and GROUP BY, 2) finding claims where no N event occurs before C using event ordering, and 3) looking for premature closures where C occurs before E or P using subqueries or EXISTS."
