This seems inconsistent because for relations like 'response', the key should be a pair of activities, e.g., (A, B) meaning A response B.

Perhaps I need to infer from standard DECLARE models. In DECLARE, constraints like existence are unary, while response, precedence, etc., are binary. But the prompt explicitly says for all keys, as keys the activities, which is ambiguous. Maybe for binary constraints, the key is a tuple. In the value description, it says the support (1.0) and confidence, so probably for each constraint instance, there's a support and confidence. To make it correct, I should assume that for unary constraints, keys are single activities, and for binary constraints, keys are pairs of activities."
