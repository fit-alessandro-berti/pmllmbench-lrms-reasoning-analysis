    "Text": "Now looking at the attributes Both 2003 and 2005 have High Complexity High complexity probably means more steps or more need for additional documents For Case 2003 there are two Request Additional Documents activities on April 1st and another on April 2nd This might cause delays as each request takes time to process Case 2005 has three such requests on April 1st 2nd and 3rd which is even more Each request likely adds time as the claimant has to provide more info"

    "Text": "Regionwise 2003 is in Region A and 2005 in Region B Its possible that one region has more delays But since both have high complexity its hard to tell if region is the main cause However maybe Region B has slower processing times overall The managers involved are different Manager Ann for 2003 and Manager Bill for 2005 Maybe Manager Bill is slower in approving but since 2005s approval is on April 4th its a bit later but Im not sure Finance roles Finance Alan for 2003 and Finance Carl for 2005 Not sure if they contribute to the delays"
