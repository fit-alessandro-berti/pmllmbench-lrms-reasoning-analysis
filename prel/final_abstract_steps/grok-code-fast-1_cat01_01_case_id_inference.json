Each event links to patients via age, gender, and additional info, such as triage codes or surgery types."

Examples include 45M with hairline fracture, 62F with minor infection, and 28M undergoing knee surgery. Discharges show follow-up plans, like outpatient clinic for 45M or physiotherapy for 28M."
