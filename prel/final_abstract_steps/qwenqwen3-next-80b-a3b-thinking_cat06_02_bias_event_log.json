C001: TRUE, Highland Civic Darts Club  +10 C002: TRUE, None  0 C003: FALSE, None  0 C004: TRUE, Highland Civic Darts Club  +10 C005: FALSE, None  0 So the only time there's a ScoreAdjustment is when CommunityGroup is Highland Civic Darts Club, which gives +10. But why is that? The ScoreAdjustment column says +10 (Community) for C001 and C004. For others, it's 0 or N/A. Wait, in PreliminaryScoring activity, ScoreAdjustment is shown. For C001 and C004, there's a +10 from Community. But for others, it's 0 or N/A. So the adjustment is based on CommunityGroup. If CommunityGroup is Highland Civic Darts Club, then +10. If None, then 0. So the adjustment is only for those in that specific community group."

C002 has 720, approved. C004 has 700, approved. C003 has 715, rejected. So maybe the threshold is 710? But 715 is above 710, but rejected. Hmm, that's confusing."

C003's score is 715, rejected. If the threshold for non-community members is 720, then 715 would be rejected. But C002 has 720 approved, which would fit. So maybe the threshold is 720 for non-community members, but 700 for community members. Because C004's adjusted score is 700, which meets the threshold for community members.

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If that's the case, then the system is using a different threshold for different groups, which is a form of bias. But the data doesn't explicitly say the thresholds. However, looking at the decisions: - Community group members (Highland Civic Darts Club): C001 (720 approved), C004 (700 approved). So if their threshold is 700, then yes. - Non-community members: C002 (720 approved), C003 (715 rejected), C005 (740 approved). So if the threshold is 720, then C002 and C005 are above, C003 is below. So that would make sense. So for community members, threshold is 700. For non-community, threshold is 720. That would explain why C004 (700) is approved (as community member), but C003 (715) is rejected (non-community, threshold 720). But is that a fair policy? If the community group is given a lower threshold, then that's a bias because it's giving preferential treatment to that group."

This suggests that the community group adjustment is overriding other factors, leading to unfair outcomes."
