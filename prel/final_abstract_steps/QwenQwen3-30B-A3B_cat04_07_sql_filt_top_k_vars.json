Then, aggregate these sequences to count how many cases are in each variant. Let's call this CTE variant_counts. 3. From variant_counts, select the top K variants (maybe using a window function or LIMIT K after ordering). 4. Then, get the case_ids that are part of these top K variants. 5.

Another possible optimization: instead of using a CTE for top_variants, we can use a subquery directly in the WHERE clause. But the current structure is correct. So the final query should be as written above. But let me check for possible syntax errors. For example, in DuckDB, the array_agg function is available. Yes, DuckDB supports array_agg with ORDER BY. Yes, the syntax is correct. Another thing: the case_sequences CTE is needed to get the activity_sequence per case. Then, the variant_counts groups by that sequence. Then, the top variants are selected. Then, the events are selected by joining with case_sequences. Yes. So this should be the correct query."
