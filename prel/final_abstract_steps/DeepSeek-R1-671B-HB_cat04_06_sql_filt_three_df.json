Among those cases, check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.\n3. Exclude such cases and return all events from the remaining cases."

Then, for each case, check if there are three consecutive rows where the activities are in the specified order.\n\nAlternatively, using window functions like LEAD to look at the next activities. For example, for each 'Approve Purchase Requisition' in a case, check if the next activity is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'."
