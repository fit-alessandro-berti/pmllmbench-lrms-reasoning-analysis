So the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' would be LEAD(timestamp, 2) - LEAD(timestamp, 1). Wait, no. Let's see: Original row (n): activity is 'Approve...', timestamp t1. Row n+1: activity 'Create Order', timestamp t2. Row n+2: activity 'Confirm Order', timestamp t3. So the time between Create and Confirm is t3 - t2.

First, for each case, we can check all triplets of consecutive events. Let's use LEAD. So write a subquery that, for each event in the case, looks ahead two steps. Something like:\n\nWITH triplet_check AS (\n  SELECT \n    case_id,\n    activity,\n    LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity,\n    LEAD(activity, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_next_activity,\n    LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS create_order_time,\n    LEAD(timestamp, 2) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time\n  FROM event_log\n)\nSELECT case_id\nFROM triplet_check\nWHERE \n  activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition' \n  AND next_activity = 'Create Order' \n  AND next_next_activity = 'Confirm Order'\n  AND DATEDIFF('day', create_order_time, confirm_order_time) > 5;"

Alternatively, the CTE could get all case_ids that have at least one triplet meeting the criteria. But in the triplet_check, each row corresponds to an event in the log. So the same case_id could appear multiple times. So in the WHERE clause, when we match the activity and next activities, we can get all the case_ids where such a triplet exists. Then, in the main query, aggregate by case_id and check if any of those triplets have the time difference >5 days. Wait, but the DATEDIFF condition is part of the triplet_check. So the query would select case_ids that have at least one triplet where all the activities are in order and the time difference between create and confirm is >5 days. Yes. That's correct."

For example:\n\nEvent1: Approve, timestamp 1\nEvent2: Some other activity, timestamp 2\nEvent3: Create Order, timestamp3\nEvent4: Confirm Order, timestamp4\n\nIn this case, the LEAD(activity,1) from Event1 is 'Some other activity', which breaks the sequence.

Edge Cases:\n\n- A case has multiple triplets, some meet the time condition and some don't. For example, one triplet has a time difference of 6 days, another has 4 days. The case should be excluded because at least one triplet meets the criteria.\n\nThe query will find that case if any of the triplets meet the criteria."

So if create_order_time is 2023-01-01 10:00:00 and confirm_order_time is 2023-01-06 11:00:00, the DATEDIFF is 5 days, which is not more than 5. But if confirm is 2023-01-07, then it's 6 days, which is more. So the condition DATEDIFF(...) >5 would capture those cases where it's more than 5 days. Yes."

So using LEAD(1) and LEAD(2) in the same window ordered by timestamp ensures that there are no other events in between, as the next events are the immediate next ones in chronological order.
