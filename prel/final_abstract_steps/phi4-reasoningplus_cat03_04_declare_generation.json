And for others, its similar. Lets examine the scenario: Multi department product design process. We have 10 events from Idea Generation to Final Launch. The DECLARE constraints are usually something like:\n existence: It means that a particular activity must exist in a trace.\n absence: It means that an event is not allowed if certain conditions hold maybe But check definition: existence rules are for mandatory behavior, absence for forbidden behavior."

I assume each activity is given a dictionary with key support: 1.0 and confidence: some value. We need to design a DECLARE model that captures these rules. But which ones We need to check what rules we want for this process: ... Which ones are design IG, DD; then technical feasibility check TFC and cost evaluation CE; then prototyping: PC; then testing: LT, UT; then approval gate AG; then marketing plan MP; then final launch FL. But the ordering in process might be: ... Maybe an ordering: IG DD TFC CE AG (Approval Gate) then PC LT UT MP FL, but thats not likely because Approval Gate usually comes after testing. Alternatively, maybe ordering: IG must occur. DD must always occur after IG. TFC and CE might be performed in parallel ... So it might require co occurrence rules: PC only occurs if TFC and CE have occurred. ... Maybe an ordering: IG DD TFC CE PC LT UT AG MP FL"

Perhaps I must include all keys even if they are empty for certain constraints. But probably we want to define each rule with at least one activity.

For relational rules: ... Maybe Ill leave them empty dictionaries for now. ... I think its best to define absence as empty if no forbidden events.
