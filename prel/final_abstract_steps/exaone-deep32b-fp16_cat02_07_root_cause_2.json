    "Text": "By analyzing durations case by case, it was determined that Cases 2003 (2 days and 20 minutes) and 2005 (3.7 days) had significantly longer durations compared to others. Case 2002 (26 hours) also exhibited a moderate delay but was shorter than high-complexity cases."

    "Text": "High-complexity cases (2003, 2005) were observed to involve multiple 'Request Additional Documents' events, resulting in longer processing times. Claims with low or medium complexity required fewer requests and completed faster, establishing a pattern."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Correlations between complexity and duration were verified—cases with high complexity involved 2-3 requests (2003, 2005), leading to longer process times. Examining the event timeline validated that each document request incrementally added processing delays."

    "Text": "Examining regional attributes revealed Region B’s high-complexity case (2005) took longer than Region A’s (2003), possibly implicating regional inefficiencies. However, this might also stem from the higher number of requests in 2005 (3 vs. 2)."

    "Text": "Resources such as Adjuster_Lisa were observed handling all three requests in Case 2005. This suggests workload imbalance or process inefficiencies as another contributing factor to delays."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "It was hypothesized that high complexity inherently demands more document requests, delaying progress significantly. Concurrent inefficiencies in resource allocation or process execution, especially in Region B, exacerbate delays."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Heuristically, the number of document requests appears to be a proxy for complexity, with explicit links shown between more requests and extended processing times for high-complexity cases (e.g., 0 requests for low, 1 for medium, 2+ for high complexity)."
