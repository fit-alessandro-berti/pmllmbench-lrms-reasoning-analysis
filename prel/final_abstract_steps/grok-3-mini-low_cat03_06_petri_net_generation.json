In standard Petri nets for processes, we often have implicit choices or just model the possible sequences. To keep it simple, Ill model it as: - Place before DV -> DV transition -> Place after DV - From Place after DV, arc to RDS transition -> Place after RDS -> Back to Place before DV (for the loop) - Also from Place after DV, arc to FC transition (assuming that after successful DV, it goes to FC) In Petri nets, from a place, you can have multiple outgoing arcs to different transitions, meaning that as long as theres a token, any enabled transition can fire. For loops, its fine. Similarly for FC and II."

Since RDS leads back, perhaps its okay: the token goes to t_RDS, fires, goes to a place that loops back to p_after_DV or to the place before DV. Lets think."

To make it loop properly, from p_after_RDS, arc back to the place that enables t_DV, which is p_before_DV, but I havent defined that. Perhaps redefine: Have a place before each transition.

In the net, its possible that it goes to t_RDS, but thats not intended. However, in process modeling, we accept that the net allows for that, even if in reality it doesnt happen.
