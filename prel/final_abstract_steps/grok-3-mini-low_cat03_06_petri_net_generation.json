If documents are incomplete, Re-Document Submission (RDS) This could loop back to DV. 5. Fraud Check (FC) 6. If fraud doubts, In-depth Investigation (II) This might loop back to FC multiple times. 7. Claim Assessment (CA) 8. Approval (AP) Only if the amount is above a threshold. 9. Payment (P) 10. Notification (N) 11. Closure (CL) The process flows sequentially with possible loops: - After DV, if incomplete, go to RDS and back to DV. - After FC, if doubts, go to II and back to FC multiple times. Finally, after P, go to N and then CL."

Let me sketch a basic structure: - Start with a place for the initial state, say start. - Transition for C (Insurance Claim). - Then a place after C. - Transition for CR. - Place after CR. - Transition for DV. - After DV, a place that leads to either RDS or FC. To handle loops: - After DV, if documents are okay, go to FC; else, go to RDS, then back to DV."

    "Text": "In Petri nets, we dont model decisions directly; we model the possible paths. So, perhaps: - From DV, have an arc to a place that leads to FC if okay. - And another path: from DV to RDS, then from RDS back to DV. That would create a loop between DV and RDS. Similarly for FC and II. A common way is to have a place after DV that can lead to either FC or to RDS, but since the decision isnt modeled, we might need to represent the loop explicitly."

    "Text": "This is getting messy. Lets try to list the sequence. The main flow: start -> C -> CR -> DV -> FC -> CA -> AP -> P -> N -> CL -> end With loops: from after DV, if not ok, go to RDS then back to DV From after FC, if doubts, go to II then back to FC So, for the loop: After t_DV, instead of going directly to t_FC, go to a place, say p_DV_ok, from which it can go to t_FC, or if not ok, the token is sent to t_RDS first. In Petri nets, to model the loop, I can have: - t_DV -> p_after_DV - p_after_DV -> t_FC  (if ok) - p_after_DV -> t_RDS (if not ok) Then, t_RDS -> p_after_RDS - p_after_RDS -> t_DV  (back to DV) Yes, that works. So the token in p_after_DV can choose to go to t_FC or t_RDS. In the process, its based on some condition, but in the net, its non-deterministic. Similarly for FC and II."

    "Text": "After t_FC, go to p_after_FC From p_after_FC, arc to t_CA (if no doubts) And from p_after_FC, arc to t_II (if doubts) Then, t_II outputs to, say, p_after_II, and p_after_II to the input of t_FC, which is p_after_DV But that means after II, it goes back to p_after_DV, which could then go to t_FC or to t_RDS again, which is not correct; it should only go back to t_FC. This is a problem. To fix this, I need a separate place for the input of t_FC. Another way: Have the loop separate. For example, for the DV loop: Have p_before_DV -> t_DV -> p_after_DV -> t_FC (if ok) But for the loop, from p_after_DV -> t_RDS -> p_before_DV Yes! So, lets define: For DV: p_before_DV -> t_DV -> p_after_DV From p_after_DV -> t_FC (if ok) And from p_after_DV -> t_RDS (if not ok) Then, t_RDS -> p_before_DV (back to before DV) Similarly for FC: p_before_FC -> t_FC -> p_after_FC -> t_CA (if no doubts) And from p_after_FC -> t_II (if doubts) t_II -> p_before_FC (back to before FC) Yes!
