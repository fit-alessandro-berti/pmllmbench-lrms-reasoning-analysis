Sufficient Inventory Path: - Starts with: Receive order - Then: Check inventory - Then: Authorize payment - Then: Package items - Then: Ship order - Finally: Close order 2. Insufficient Inventory Path: - Starts with: Receive order - Then: Check inventory - Then: Cancel order - Finally: Close order"

    "Text": "Key constraints: - Authorize payment must occur after Check inventory and before Package items. - Package items must occur after Authorize payment and before Ship order. - Ship order must occur after Package items and never after Cancel order. - Close order should be the final activity. - No activities for fulfillment (like Package, Ship) after Cancel."

    "Text": "Now, lets list out the cases from the event log: Case 1: - Receive order - Check inventory - Authorize payment - Package items - Ship order - Close order This matches the sufficient inventory path perfectly. Case 4: - Receive order - Check inventory - Cancel order - Close order This matches the insufficient inventory path."

    "Text": "Case 2: - Receive order - Check inventory - Package items - Authorize payment - Ship order - Close order Here, Package items happens before Authorize payment. According to the description, Package items should only occur after Authorize payment. Case 3: - Receive order - Check inventory - Authorize payment - Cancel order - Ship order - Close order After Cancel order, it proceeds to Ship order. The description says that after cancellation, it should go directly to Close order, and its illogical to continue with fulfillment activities like shipping. Case 5: - Receive order - Check inventory - Authorize payment - Ship order - Close order Missing Package items before Ship order. The description states that Package items should occur before Ship order."
