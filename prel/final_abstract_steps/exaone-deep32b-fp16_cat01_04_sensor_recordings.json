    "Text": "Inferred that steady increases in vibration and temperature, coupled with material flow and tool movement (events 4–6), strongly correlate with cutting operations. High temperature, vibration, and energy spikes in event 9 further suggest welding activity."

    "Text": "Generalized from the steady lower values in vibration and moderate material flow during events 10–12 to label this phase as assembling, based on typical assembly characteristics."

    "Text": "Checked that event parameters such as temperature and vibration align with common manufacturing tasks like cutting, welding, and assembling described in the problem prompt."

    "Text": "Excluded events where the machine showed no meaningful activity (e.g., events 1–3 and 13), labeling these as idle or transition states to focus only on high-level activities."
