    "Text": "Starting by looking at the data, all events are from Machine M1 over a 10-minute span (from 08:00:00 to 08:01:10). Let me list out the events and see how the parameters change over time. Looking at the first few events (1-3): Events 1-3 have temperatures around 20째C, pressure 1 bar, vibration 0, material flow 0, tool position 0, and energy around 0.5 to 0.45. These seem like initial conditions, maybe the machine is starting up but not active yet. The low or zero values in flow, vibration, and tool position suggest it's in a standby or idle phase."

    "Text": "Then event 4 jumps to temperature 50째C, pressure 1.5, vibration 30Hz, material flow 5, tool position 5, energy 2.00. That's a big spike in temperature, vibration, and flow. The tool position moves to 5mm. This looks like an active process. High vibration and temperature might indicate something like cutting or grinding where there's physical contact and friction. The material flow increasing suggests material is moving through the machine. So maybe this is the 'Cutting Metal' phase? Events 4-6 continue with increasing temperature (505558), vibration up to 38Hz, flow rate increasing to 38, tool position moving to 10mm. Energy consumption is rising each time."

Hmm, that's a sharp decrease. Then event8 same as 7. Then event9 has vibration 50? Wait no, event9's vibration is listed as 50? Wait let me check again. Wait the table for event9: Event9: Vibration Level (Hz) is 50? Wait no, looking at the data: Wait the columns: Vibration Level (Hz). Let me recheck the data. Wait let me go row by row: Event4: Vibration 30 Hz Event5: 35 Event6:38 Event7: Vibration 10? Yes. Then event9: Vibration Level is 50? Yes, according to the user's table, event9's Vibration Level is 50 Hz."

This is a bit confusing. Let me try to group events into phases based on the parameter trends. First phase (events1-3): Initial state, low activity. Maybe 'Startup/Idle'. Phase 1 (events4-6): High temp, vibration, flow, tool moving. Likely 'Cutting Metal'. Then event7-8: Sudden drop in vibration and flow, but temp still higher than initial. Pressure increases. Maybe a transition. Then event9 jumps again: temp to 80, vibration back to 50, flow to 50. This could be another active phase. Maybe welding?"

    "Text": "Wait the user's event6 line: 'Material Flow (units/s) |5 | ...' Ah, so Vibration is 38, Material Flow is 5, Tool Position 10mm. So Material Flow stays at 5 for events4-6. Then event7's Material Flow is 2? Yes, so event7's Material Flow is 2. Then event8 same as 7. Then event9's Material Flow is 50? Yes, so event9's Material Flow jumps to 50. Then event10's is 1, event11 5, event12 5, then 0. Oh! This changes things. I had misread the Material Flow for events4-6 as increasing, but actually it's constant at 5. The vibration increases from 30 to 38, but the material flow stays at 5. Then in event9, material flow jumps to 50."

    "Text": "So with corrected Material Flow: Events4-6: Temp 50-58, vibration 30-38, flow 5, tool moving from 5 to 10mm. This is a sustained cutting phase with increasing temperature and vibration, but material flow stays constant. Then event7-8: Temp drops to 40, vibration drops to 10, flow drops to 2, tool stays at 15. Pressure increases to 2. Maybe this is a setup phase. Event9: Sudden spike in all parameters except pressure. Temp 80, vibration 50, flow 50. This is a new phase. The high flow suggests a lot of material moving, high temp and vibration. Maybe this is welding. Then events10-12: After event9, the parameters drop. Temp goes to 30, then 25, vibration drops to 1-5, flow to 1 then 5, tool moves to 20mm. Maybe assembling parts here. Possible groupings: 1. Cutting Metal: Events4-6 2. Welding: Event9 3. Assembling Parts: Events10-12"

    "Text": "For Cutting (events4-6): Temp increases from 50 to 58, vibration increases, tool moves further. This is consistent with cutting where the tool is moving through the material, with friction causing temp and vibration. Material flow is steady, so the material is being fed at a constant rate. Welding (event9): Sudden spike in temperature (80째C), vibration (50 Hz), material flow (50 units/s), and energy (5kWh) suggest a high-energy process like welding, possibly with rapid material movement and intense thermal activity. Assembling (events10-12): Lower vibration (1-5 Hz), moderate temperature (25-30째C), fluctuating material flow (1 to 5 units/s), and tool repositioning (to 20mm) indicate parts being adjusted or joined with less forceful movements compared to cutting or welding. The remaining events (1-3,7-8,13) are either setup/idle or transitions between phases and thus not labeled as main activities."
