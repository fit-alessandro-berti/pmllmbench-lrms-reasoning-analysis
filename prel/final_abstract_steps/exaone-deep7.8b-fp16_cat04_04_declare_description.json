    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "By considering examples of real-world loan processes, the model postulates that performing a 'Preliminary Credit Check' before gathering additional documents is vital to ensure eligibility assessment early. This conclusion is supported by the 'succession' constraint."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",

    "Text": "Speculates on the consequences if steps such as the 'Preliminary Credit Check' are omitted, suggesting potential financial losses due to high-risk approvals. However, this thought experiment does not directly affect the correctness of the reasoning."
