    "Text": "The event log has columns: Event #, Timestamp, Machine ID, Temperature (Â°C), Pressure (bar), Vibration Level (Hz), Material Flow (units/s), Tool Position (mm), and Energy (kWh). All events are from Machine ID M1, so I dont need to worry about multiple machines. I need to group events based on patterns in these readings and assign labels to those groups. Let me list out the events and their key values for easy reference: 1. Temp: 20, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.50 2. Temp: 20, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.40 3. Temp: 21, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.45 4. Temp: 50, Press: 1, Vib: 30, Flow: 5, Tool: 5, Energy: 2.00 5. Temp: 55, Press: 1.5, Vib: 35, Flow: 5, Tool: 7, Energy: 2.50 6. Temp: 58, Press: 1.5, Vib: 38, Flow: 5, Tool: 10, Energy: 3.00 7. Temp: 40, Press: 2, Vib: 10, Flow: 2, Tool: 15, Energy: 2.00 8. Temp: 40, Press: 2, Vib: 10, Flow: 2, Tool: 15, Energy: 2.00 (same as 7) 9. Temp: 80, Press: 2, Vib: 50, Flow: 0, Tool: 15, Energy: 5.00 10. Temp: 30, Press: 1, Vib: 1, Flow: 0, Tool: 15, Energy: 1.00 11. Temp: 25, Press: 1, Vib: 5, Flow: 1, Tool: 20, Energy: 1.50 12. Temp: 25, Press: 1, Vib: 5, Flow: 1, Tool: 20, Energy: 1.60 13. Temp: 20, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.50 (similar to 1-3) 14. Temp: 20, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.45 (similar) 15. Temp: 21, Press: 1, Vib: 0, Flow: 0, Tool: 0, Energy: 0.40 (similar)"

    "Text": "Now, I need to identify patterns: - Events 1-3: Low temperature (20-21C), low pressure (1 bar), no vibration (0 Hz), no flow (0), tool at 0, low energy (0.40-0.50). This looks like an idle or startup state. - Events 4-6: Rising temperature (50-58C), increasing pressure (1-1.5 bar), high vibration (30-38 Hz), steady flow (5 units/s), tool moving (5-10 mm), increasing energy (2.00-3.00). This suggests an active process, maybe heating up or cutting. - Events 7-8: Temperature at 40C, pressure at 2 bar, moderate vibration (10 Hz), low flow (2 units/s), tool at 15 mm, energy at 2.00. Similar but not as intense as 4-6; perhaps a transition or assembling. - Event 9: High temperature (80C), pressure at 2 bar, very high vibration (50 Hz), no flow (0), tool at 15 mm, high energy (5.00). This could be welding or something that requires high heat and vibration. - Event 10: Temperature drops to 30C, pressure back to 1 bar, low vibration (1 Hz), no flow, tool at 15 mm, low energy (1.00). Cooling down or inspection. - Events 11-12: Temperature 25C, pressure 1 bar, low vibration (5 Hz), low flow (1 units/s), tool at 20 mm, energy 1.50-1.60. Mild activity, perhaps final assembly or adjustment. - Events 13-15: Back to low values, similar to 1-3, so idle again."
