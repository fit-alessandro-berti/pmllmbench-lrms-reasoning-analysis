But how does the code ensure that both QA and SA are done before GLA? Because if QA and SA are both connected to GLA, then GLA must start after both QA and SA have completed. Wait, in partial order, if QA and SA are two nodes, then GLA can't start until all its predecessors are completed. Because each edge represents an ordering constraint. So if QA and SA are both predecessors of GLA, then GLA can't start until both QA and SA are done. That's correct."

The scenario here requires that after the loop, the deployment is chosen, and in the problem description, both CD and MD are explicit steps. So no silent transitions are needed here. The XOR is between CD and MD, which are both transitions with labels. So no need for a silent transition. The problem description says that the loop can exit after BNC. So the loop node is BNC followed by optional D&R, then repeat. The loop operator (A,B) means execute A, then exit or execute B and then A again. So the loop operator already models this, no need for silent transitions here. Similarly, the XOR choice between CD and MD is explicit, so no silent transitions are needed. Thus, the code doesn't need any SilentTransition instances."

Wait, but what about the dependencies of QA and SA? Are they both required after xor_node? Yes. I think that's correct. Another check: DA and ACI are concurrent. The code has no edges between DA and ACI, which is correct. So the code should model the scenario accurately."
