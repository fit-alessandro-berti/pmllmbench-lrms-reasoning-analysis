After CS, DA and ACI can be done. So DA and ACI are after CS. 3. DA and ACI must both complete before loop starts. So loop_node is after DA and ACI. 4. After loop_node, xor_node is executed. 5. After xor_node, QA and SA can start. Both must be done before GLA."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, but what about silent transitions? The problem says that in the example, theres a silent transition used as a child of an XOR. The scenario here requires that after the loop, the deployment is chosen, and in the problem description, both CD and MD are explicit steps. So no silent transitions are needed here."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The loop operator (A,B) means execute A, then exit or execute B and then A again. So the loop operator already models this, no need for silent transitions here. Similarly, the XOR choice between CD and MD is explicit, so no silent transitions are needed. Thus, the code doesnt need any SilentTransition instances."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
