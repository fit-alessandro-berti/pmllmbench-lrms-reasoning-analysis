The task is to compare them, identify which one shows bias, and explain how the bias manifests, focusing on LocalResident, CommunityGroup, and ScoreAdjustment. First, I need to understand the structure of the logs. Both groups have similar activities: ApplicationReceived, DataValidation, PreliminaryScoring, ManualReview, FinalDecision. Each has timestamps, LocalResident (TRUE/FALSE), CommunityGroup (name or None), PreliminaryScore, ScoreAdjustment, Decision, and Resource."

The FinalDecision is Approved. U002 is a LocalResident (TRUE) but no CommunityGroup. PreliminaryScore 710, no adjustment. FinalDecision Rejected.
