    "Text": "Deconstruct the Goal: The core task is to take a list of events, each with several attributes, and group them into cases. A case represents a single patients journey through the hospital. The key challenge is that theres no explicit case_id column. I need to infer it. Identify the Case Identifiers: What makes a set of events belong to the same patient? Static Attributes: The most reliable identifiers are attributes that shouldnt change for a single patient during their visit. In this dataset, patient_age and patient_gender are perfect candidates. A 45-year-old male is unlikely to become a 62-year-old female in the middle of their ER visit."

    "Text": "Dynamic Attributes (Contextual Clues): Timestamp: Events for the same patient should happen in a logical, chronological order. An event for a patient at 08:05 shouldnt be followed by an event for the same patient at 08:03. Also, the time gaps between consecutive events for a single patient should make sense in the context of the activity (e.g., a 2-minute gap for registration is normal, a 5-hour gap might suggest a different patient or a long wait). Activity Flow: The sequence of activities must be logical. You cant have a Patient discharged event before a Register patient event. You cant have Surgery performed before Doctor consultation or Surgery preparation. This helps link events together. Department: A patient might move between departments (e.g., ER -> Radiology -> ER), but the flow should make sense. A patient registered in Surgery is unlikely to suddenly have an ER triage event unless theres a specific, documented reason (which isnt present here). Resource: While not a primary identifier, it can provide clues. Dr. Lee consulting on a patient in Surgery and then performing surgery on that same patient is a strong link. Additional Info: This is a goldmine. insurance=private for a 45M is a good starting point. triage_code=3 for that same 45M links the registration to the triage. body_part=left_leg for the X-ray links it to the subsequent diagnosis of hairline_fracture. reason=scheduled_knee_surgery links the consultation to the surgery preparation and the surgery itself."

    "Text": "Formulate a Strategy: Start with the most reliable, unchanging attribute: the combination of patient_age and patient_gender. This will create initial buckets or potential cases. Lets scan the list and create these buckets: Bucket A: 45, M Bucket B: 62, F Bucket C: 28, M Now, go through the list event by event and place each event into its corresponding bucket based on age and gender. After placing all events, verify the logic within each bucket. Does the sequence of timestamps make sense? Is the activity flow logical? Do the departments and additional info support the narrative of a single patient journey? If a bucket looks inconsistent, Ill need to reconsider my initial assumptions. But in this dataset, the age/gender combination seems very distinct and reliable."

    "Text": "Final Review and Formatting: Now that the events are grouped, I need to present the answer clearly. Ill define each case with a unique identifier (Case 1, Case 2, Case 3). Ill summarize the key patient attributes for each case to make it easy to understand who the case is about. Ill list the events for each case in chronological order, referencing the original event numbers. Ill add a Reasoning section to explain how I arrived at this conclusion. This is crucial for demonstrating the logic. Ill mention the key identifiers: patient_age, patient_gender, and the logical flow of activity and timestamp. This structured explanation makes the answer robust and easy to follow."
