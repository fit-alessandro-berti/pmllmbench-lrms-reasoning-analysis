    "Text": "The current parallel block allows Pay Invoice before receiving goods which is bad since you shouldnt pay without verifying goods arrived Or Pay before matching Or receive invoice but pay before matching Receive goods before the PO is created Wait no because Create PO is in the parallel block as well Wait no in the current model the parallel block includes Create PO but thats part of the parallel block Wait the current structure is The root sequence is create req  approve req  parallel block which includes create po receive goods receive invoice match pay  close case Wait thats a problem The Create Purchase Order is part of the parallel block Wait in the original process steps Create Purchase Order comes after the requisition is approved The current model has create po in the parallel block but the parallel block is after approve req So Create PO is in the same parallel block as receive goods etc But in the standard process Create Purchase Order should be done before the goods can be received because the PO is sent to the supplier So the PO must be created before the goods are received But in the current model the PO is in the parallel block meaning it could be done at the same time as receiving goods which is okay but the problem is that other steps like receiving goods can start before the PO is created Wait no because the parallel block includes create po as one of the parallel branches So in the parallel block the create po can be done in parallel with the other steps Thats a problem Wait the parallel operator in process trees allows all children to be executed in any order but must all be completed before proceeding Wait actually the parallel operator requires all branches to be executed but their order can be interleaved Hmm perhaps the problem is that the parallel block includes create po so in the current model the Create PO could be done in parallel with say receiving goods but thats okay as long as the PO is created before the goods are sent But the bigger issue is the other steps in the parallel block Wait perhaps the main issue is that the parallel block includes all those steps create po receive goods receive invoice match pay so steps that must come after others are allowed to be done out of order Lets list the correct dependencies The correct order after the requisition is approved 3 Create PO this has to happen before any of the other steps except maybe the parallel steps After the PO is created the supplier sends the goods and invoice But in the process flow The steps after the PO The company sends the PO to the supplier The supplier sends the goods and invoice the invoice might come with the goods or separately The company receives the goods then receives the invoice Then they match the invoice against the PO and the goods received Only after that can they pay So the correct sequence after creating the PO is Create PO  then the subsequent steps are Receive Goods can happen but the order between Goods and Invoice The invoice might come after the goods or before but either way the matching process requires both The Match step cant happen until both the invoice is received and the goods are received and the PO exists Then after matching they can pay the invoice then close the case Wait but the Pay Invoice must come after the Match because you need to verify via the match before paying So the steps after Create PO need to be The Create PO is done first since its in the parallel block but in the current model all the steps in the parallel block can be done in any order so the PO could be created after goods are received Thats not possible Wait in the current models parallel block the create po is part of the parallel block so the Create PO must be done before proceeding but in parallel with other steps Wait perhaps the model allows the other steps like Receive Goods to happen before the PO is created which would be impossible Because the PO is the order from the company to the supplier so the goods cant be delivered until the PO is sent so the company cant receive goods unless the PO was created Therefore in the current model since Create PO is part of the parallel block with Receive Goods its possible that someone could receive goods before creating the PO Thats impossible Wait no because the parallel block requires all children to be executed Wait in a parallel operator all the children must be executed but their order can be any So the Create PO must happen eventually But the goods can be received before the PO is created Thats impossible in reality so the current model allows that because the parallel block treats Create PO as one of the parallel branches Therefore the current model is flawed because the Create PO must be done before the goods can be received but in the parallel block since they are parallel the system allows the receipt of goods before the PO is created which is impossible Therefore the first major issue is that Create Purchase Order is part of the parallel block along with other steps which allows steps that depend on the PO like receiving goods to be done before the PO is created which is impossible"
