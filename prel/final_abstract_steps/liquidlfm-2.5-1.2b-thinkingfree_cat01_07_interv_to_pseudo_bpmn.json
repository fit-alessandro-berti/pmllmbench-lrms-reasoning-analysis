    "Text": "The sequence should start with receiving the invoice then checking validity moving forward steps like verifying PO checking purchases confirming with manager handling discrepancies escalating etc Gates are the checks where confirmation is needed like manager approval Activities are the individual tasks like verifying PO checking differences etc"

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should also include the sequence flow where after sending confirmation to Marl then manager approves when needed Also mention possible alternatives like If discrepancies arise and cannot be resolved via steps above go to exception handling Make sure to mention artifacts like invoice data PO numbers confirmations references Also each role appears in different steps Like Maria participates Manager in approval etc Alright putting this all together into a coherent textual description"
