Understand the DECLARE model structure: - Its a Python dictionary with specific keys - For keys: existence, absence, exactly_one, init - value is a dictionary with activities as keys and support/confidence as values - For other keys (binary constraints between activities) - value is also a dictionary with activities (as tuples or pairs) as keys and support/confidence as values"

    "Text": "Let me think about what constraints make sense for this product design and launch process: I see the core activities forming a logical sequence from initial concept to market launch. Each activity builds upon the previous one, suggesting a structured progression. The workflow requires sequential validation and approval, ensuring each stage meets specific criteria before advancing. This approach ensures systematic product development with built-in quality checks and strategic decision points. The process begins with generating innovative ideas, then moves through design, technical and cost evaluations, prototype creation, testing phases, management approval, and finally market preparation and launch. Each step serves a critical purpose in transforming an initial concept into a viable market-ready product."

    "Text": "Key progression points include: - Idea generation must initiate design drafting - Technical and cost evaluations must precede prototype creation - User and lab testing must validate product feasibility - Approval gates prevent premature market entry - Final launch requires comprehensive pre-launch activities The constraints ensure systematic progression while preventing potential missteps in product development. Activities like marketing and technical checks have flexible placement, allowing strategic adaptability in the workflow. Chain responses enforce immediate subsequent actions, maintaining process integrity through sequential dependencies."
