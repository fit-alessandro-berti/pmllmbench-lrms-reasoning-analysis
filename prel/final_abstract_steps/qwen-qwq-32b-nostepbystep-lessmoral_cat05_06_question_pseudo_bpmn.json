    "Text": "Starting with rationale behind the process flows Why parallel gateways for component sourcing Why Malaysia for assembly Why exclusive gateway after quality checks Improvements How can the component procurement be optimized Is there a way to reduce lead time in assembly Can logistics be streamlined Risk management What risks are there in sourcing from specific countries How to handle supply chain disruptions What are the risks in quality checks Decision making How are decisions made during quality checks What criteria determine the path after exclusive gateway Stakeholder communication How do stakeholders coordinate component sourcing How is communication handled during rework How do logistics partners communicate delays Performance measurement How is assembly efficiency tracked How is inventory accuracy measured What KPIs are used for suppliers"

    "Text": "1 Why is market research placed before R&D How does it influence the prototype design 2 What factors led to choosing Malaysia as the assembly location over other countries 3 How are the component suppliers in different countries vetted and what risks does this multi source approach mitigate 4 How does the parallel procurement structure ensure timely component delivery without bottlenecks 5 In quality checks what specific metrics determine if a unit passes or requires rework 6 What are the key challenges in coordinating parallel component shipments to the assembly plant 7 How does the current logistics split air vs sea balance cost and speed for different markets 8 What are the implications of centralized customs clearance versus decentralized approaches 9 How are regional distribution strategies tailored to market specific demands eg Europe vs LatAm 10 In case of a failed quality check what data is analyzed to identify root causes and how is that feedback loop structured 11 What mechanisms exist to ensure alignment between R&D prototypes and the capabilities of the assembly plant 12 How does the system handle unexpected changes in component availability eg a Taiwanese microprocessor shortage 13 What performance metrics are used to evaluate the efficiency of the 24 7 assembly process 14 What are the communication protocols between the assembly plant and the R&D team during iterative prototype testing 15 How is the decision to adjust supplier orders made during demand fluctuations and who authorizes this 16 What ethical considerations are embedded in the component sourcing process eg labor practices environmental standards 17 How does the process account for geopolitical risks eg trade sanctions tariffs when sourcing from multiple countries 18 What technology or systems are in place to track component provenance and ensure supply chain transparency 19 How are local regulations in distribution regions eg Europes RoHS integrated into the compliance steps at customs 20 What predictive analytics or data sources inform inventory monitoring and sales forecasting accuracy"
