The event names are different: Payment Processed vs PaymentCheck. Maybe in Log A, Payment Processed indicates completion, while in Log B, PaymentCheck could be the start or a check during processing.

Then next merged event is Order Validated at 10:01:30Z (Log A) and 10:01:29Z (Log B). Merged, ordered at 10:01:30.\n\nThen Log A's Payment Processed at 10:02:00Z and Log B's PaymentCheck at 10:02:05Z. These are separate events, so they appear in order: 10:02:00 and 10:02:05. So Payment Processed comes first, then PaymentCheck. Wait, but if Log B's event is at 10:02:05, which is after 10:02:00, then the order would be:\n\n1. 10:00:00 - Order Received (merged)\n2. 10:01:30 - Order Validated (merged)\n3. 10:02:00 - Payment Processed (Log A)\n4. 10:02:05 - PaymentCheck (Log B)\n5. 10:03:00 - Quality Check (Log B)\n6. 10:05:00 - Item Shipped (merged)\n7. 10:20:00 - Item Delivered (Log A)\n\nWait, but the merged Item Shipped/Shipping event would have Log A's timestamp at 10:05:00Z and Log B's at 10:05:02. When merged, the primary timestamp is Log A's 10:05:00, so that event is placed at 10:05:00.\n\nLog B's Shipping event is at 10:05:02, but since it's merged with Log A's 10:05:00, the merged event is at 10:05:00.\n\nSo the order is as above.
