    "Text": "Starting with the interviews, Mary from Accounts Payable outlines the main steps: receiving invoices via email, checking for a PO number, logging into the system, forwarding to Purchasing for confirmation, matching line items, manager approval, and payment scheduling. She mentions escalations to her supervisor if discrepancies cant be resolved. Dan in Purchasing confirms the PO check, resolving discrepancies by contacting suppliers or holding invoices. He emphasizes needing a PO reference. Carlos, the manager, approves after confirmation from Purchasing and AP. Rita handles exceptions like missing POs or unresolved issues, sometimes creating retrospective POs. Karen helps resolve supplier issues."

If present, its logged and sent to Purchasing for confirmation. Then matching line items: if discrepancies exist, theyre resolved; if not, manager approval follows. After approval, payment is scheduled."
