    "Text": "Now, Case 2. The activities are Receive, Check inventory, Package items, Authorize payment, Ship, Close. Wait, after Check inventory, it goes to Package items, then Authorize payment. But according to the normative process, after checking inventory, if its sufficient, the next step should be Authorize payment, then Package, then Ship. So in Case 2, Packaging happens before Authorization, which is out of order. Thats a violation because payment should be authorized before packaging."

    "Text": "Moving on to Case 3. The sequence is Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship, Close. After Authorize payment, it goes to Cancel order. But the normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, after Check inventory, it should go directly to Cancel, then Close. Also, after Cancel, you shouldnt proceed to Ship. So here, after Cancel, its trying to Ship, which doesnt make sense. So two violations here: shipping after cancellation and not closing immediately after cancellation."

    "Text": "Case 5 has Receive, Check inventory, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close. Wait, after Authorize payment, it goes directly to Ship without Packaging items. The normative process says that after Authorization, you should Package, then Ship. So missing the Package step is a violation."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So summarizing the issues: Case 2: Packaging before Authorization. Case 3: Shipping after Cancellation and not closing after Cancellation. Case 5: Shipping without Packaging. I think thats all the deviations. Each of these cases breaks the sequence set by the normative process as described."
