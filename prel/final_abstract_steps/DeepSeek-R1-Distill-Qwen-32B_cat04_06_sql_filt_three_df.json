    "Text": "First, let me understand the problem. We have an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`. The table has at least three columns: `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The task is to write a SQL query that identifies cases which have a specific sequence of activities and a timing condition, then exclude those cases from the final result."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The specific sequence is three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order'. So, these must occur one after the other without any other events from the same case in between. Additionally, among these cases, we need to check if the time between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days. Finally, we exclude these cases from our result, so the output should include all events except those from the excluded cases."

    "Text": "Let me outline the steps more concretely. Step 1: Identify cases where the sequence 'Approve Purchase Requisition' -> 'Create Order' -> 'Confirm Order' occurs consecutively. I can do this by checking for each occurrence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition' whether the immediately next event is 'Create Order', and then the one after that is 'Confirm Order'."

    "Text": "But wait, using `LEAD` might not capture all possible sequences because a case might have multiple sequences. For example, a case might have the sequence starting at event 1, 3, etc. So, I need to find any occurrence of this triplet in the case's event list."

    "Text": "Wait, but the `LEAD` function in the Triplet CTE will only look at the next two events. So, if a case has more than three events, and the triplet occurs later, this approach might miss it because the `LEAD` only looks at the immediate next events."

If the timestamps are in a different format, like datetime, we might need to cast them or use a different approach to calculate the difference."
