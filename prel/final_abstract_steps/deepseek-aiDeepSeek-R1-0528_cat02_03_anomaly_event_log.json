    "Text": "The anomalies in Case 1002: 1. Issue PO before Approve PR: Typically, a purchase requisition must be approved before a purchase order is issued. Issuing a PO without approval could lead to unauthorized purchases. 2. Payment released without matching and without goods receipt: Payment is released immediately after the invoice is received, without matching the invoice to the PO and without confirming that the goods were received. This is a major control issue because: - The company might pay for goods not received (risk of paying for undelivered goods). - The invoice might not match the PO (e.g., incorrect prices, quantities) leading to overpayment. 3. Approval of PR after PO and payment: The approval of the purchase requisition after the PO has been issued and payment made is out of sequence and defeats the purpose of having an approval step (which is to authorize the purchase before it is made). 4. Goods received after payment: Normally, goods should be received and inspected before payment to ensure the company gets what it paid for. Receiving goods after payment increases the risk of not receiving the goods at all or receiving substandard goods without recourse."

Receiving goods before the PO is issued implies that the goods were delivered without a formal order. This could indicate: - A possible error in the process (e.g., the goods were delivered by mistake or without an order). - A violation of the control that requires a PO to be issued and sent to the vendor before any delivery. Without a PO, the company might receive unordered goods and then issue a PO to cover it, which could be a sign of fraud or poor controls."
