For instance, the first event in Log B is at 09:59:58, which is just 2 seconds before the first event in Log A (10:00:00). The next events in Log B are also slightly off, like 10:01:29 vs. 10:01:30 in Log A. So there's a small time difference, but within the 2-second tolerance mentioned in the requirements."
