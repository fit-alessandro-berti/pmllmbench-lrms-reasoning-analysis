    "Text": "First, I need to identify pain points in the current design: sequential bottlenecks (like parallel checks waiting for each other), manual approval gates, and reactive routing. The optimization should target three layers: pre-processing (predictive triage), execution (parallelism + automation), and post-decision (adaptive approvals)."

    "Text": "For predictive triage, I can introduce an ML-based gateway early to flag customization likelihood, which would dynamically route requests while preserving the standard/custom dichotomy. For execution, the parallel checks in the standard path need decoupling—maybe using a checks orchestra subprocess with priority queues. The approval loop is problematic; it should become a risk-based parallel step with auto-escalation thresholds."

    "Text": "Resource reallocation requires a real-time monitoring layer—maybe a resource broker that pools credit/inventory check capacity across paths. Post-decision, the rejection notice in custom paths could be enriched with fallback options."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should emphasize trade-offs: reduced turnaround time vs. increased technical debt from ML/Automation, and customer satisfaction gains from proactive service versus complexity from dynamic routing. The response must stay concrete—naming specific gateways (e.g., Predictive Triage Gateway) and subprocesses while linking each change to performance metrics."
