    "Text": "Let me check if all events are covered. List of events: 118. Case 1: 1,4,7,12,15 Case 2: 2,5,8,10,11,14,17 Case 3: 3,6,9,13,16,18 Lets count: Case 1: 5 events. Case 2: 7 events. Case 3: 6 events. Total 18 events. Yes, that adds up. Check event 12: Doctor consultation in ER for 45M. So same as case 1. Event 15: Discharge for 45M. Correct. Event 17: Discharge for 62F. Yes. Event 18: Discharge for 28M. Correct. Another check: event 10 is lab completed for 62F. Then event 11 is doctor consultation in ER for 62F. Makes sense. Event 14 is prescription for 62F (antibiotics), which would be after diagnosis of minor infection. Event 11 says diagnosis=minor_infection. So the doctor consultation (11) leads to prescription (14). Yes, thats a logical sequence. For case 3: surgery preparation (event 9) followed by surgery (13), then recovery (16), then discharge (18). Makes sense. Also, the departments for each case: Case 1: ER (register, triage, xray, consultation, discharge) Case 2: ER (register, triage, lab tests, consultation, prescription, discharge) Case 3: Surgery (register, consultation, prep, surgery, recovery, discharge) The key is that the patients age and gender are consistent across events in the same case. Also, the departments might change (like case 2 goes to lab), but the patients attributes (age, gender) stay the same. Another angle: the activity types. For example, the surgery case has a surgery performed, so its a surgical patient. Let me check if theres any overlap. For example, event 12 is a doctor consultation in ER for 45M. The previous event for that patient would be event 7 (xray) at 08:15. Then event 12 is at 08:23. So after xray, they had a doctor consultation. Thats logical. Similarly, case 2: after lab test completed (event 10 at 08:20), then doctor consultation (11 at 08:22), then prescription (14 at 08:27), then discharge (17 at 08:35). Yes, that seems to fit."
