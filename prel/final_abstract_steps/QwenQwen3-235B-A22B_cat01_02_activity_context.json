For Verify Documents, the first occurrence in each case could be Initial Document Verification, and subsequent ones could be Re-Verification of Documents or something.

Wait, but how? Because the same activity name appears in different cases, but in each case, the context may vary. Hmm, but the user wants to rename each occurrence where the context changes.
