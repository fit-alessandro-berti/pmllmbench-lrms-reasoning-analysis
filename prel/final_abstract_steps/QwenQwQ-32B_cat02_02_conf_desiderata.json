Then Loan Decision (Approved) at 11 AM. Then Inform Applicant at 1 PM, then Finalize Documentation at 1:30 PM, and finally Close Case at 2 PM. Let me check if each step follows the sequence properly. The Credit Check must be before Risk Assessment, which they did. Risk Assessment before Loan Decision is correct. Loan Decision before Inform Applicant – yes. Since approved, they finalized documentation before closing the case. There's no violation here. All steps followed the correct sequence. So Case 1 seems to be compliant with all normative constraints."

The normative rule says Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. So that's a clear violation. They did Risk Assessment before Credit Check, which is reversed. Then they did a Credit Check later, but after Risk Assessment. That violates the required order."

Then they Closed the case. So two normative violations here: first the reversed order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment, and second, finalizing docs after rejection. So Case 2 is definitely violating the normative rules."

The desiderata mentions Credit Check should be within 24 hours, but that's just a best practice. Since it's 48 hours later, that's a desideratum violation.

Wait, the next activity is Inform Applicant on 1/16 at 3 PM. The loan decision was on the 14th, so that's two days later. The desiderata says inform within 48 hours. From the Loan Decision time is 14th at noon, so adding 48 hours would be by 16th at noon, but they informed at 3 PM, so that's just over 2 days, so maybe within 48 hours? Wait, the Loan Decision was at 12:00 PM on 1/14, adding 48 hours would bring us to 1/16 12:00 PM. The Inform Applicant is 1/16 3 PM, which is 2 days and 3 hours later. So that's outside the recommended 48 hours. That's a desideratum issue."

The absence of Follow-up Call is also a desideratum. So in normative rules, everything looks compliant for Case 3. The sequence is Application Credit Check (though late) Risk Decision (approved) Inform Finalize Docs Close Case. So all steps in order, no skips.
