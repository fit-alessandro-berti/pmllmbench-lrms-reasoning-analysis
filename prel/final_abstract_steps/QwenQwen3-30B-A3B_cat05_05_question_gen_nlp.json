    "Text": "First, I need to make sure I understand all the components mentioned. The supply chain starts with RD, then sourcing components from different countries, manufacturing, distribution, and end-user delivery. There are also aspects like quality control, compliance, and digital systems."

    "Text": "The questions should be thought-provoking and cover potential issues, improvements, and implications. They need to be open-ended, so no yes/no answers. Let me brainstorm areas to explore. Maybe start with the RD phase: how does RD influence supply chain decisions? Then move to supplier management—how do lead times and quality metrics affect the process?"

Okay, I think I have a good list. Now, just need to phrase them clearly and ensure theyre all open-ended."
