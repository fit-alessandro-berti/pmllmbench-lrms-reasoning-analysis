IC and RP cant be together because the invoice is generated before payment is recorded. Wait, but IC and RP are sequential, so they cant be together in the same case. So RO and RP, CA and RP, RI and RP, etc., all cant coexist. Also, RO and IC, RO and RP, IC and RP, all are sequential, so they shouldnt be together. Wait, maybe Im overcomplicating. Let me think again. Never Together means two activities cant be in the same case at all. So, for example, if an order is processed, RO happens, and then all the subsequent activities happen. But RO and RP are both in the same case, so maybe Im wrong. Alternatively, perhaps Never Together applies to activities that are mutually exclusive. But in this process, all activities are part of the same flow, so maybe there are no Never Together constraints. Hmm, maybe I should reconsider. Wait, the Never Together constraint is when two activities cannot coexist in the same case. So, perhaps RO and RP cant be in the same case? No, because RO is the start, and RP is the end. They are in the same case. So perhaps Im misunderstanding Never Together. It might be that certain activities cant both occur in the same case because they are alternatives. But in this process, all activities are in sequence, so maybe theres no Never Together. Alternatively, maybe IC and RP cant be together because once you invoice, you record payment, so they are in sequence, not together in the same case. Wait, no, in a case, both can occur, but in sequence, not simultaneously. So perhaps Never Together isnt applicable here. Maybe I should leave Never Together as an empty set."

    "Text": "Directly-Follows Constraints: These are pairs where one activity is immediately followed by another. So RO is followed by CA. CA is followed by RI. RI is followed by PI. PI is followed by QC and PO? Wait, after PI, both QC and PO must happen. So does PI directly follow PI to QC and PI to PO? Or is it that after PI, both QC and PO must happen in some order? Or perhaps QC must come before PO? I think in the process, after picking items, you quality check them, then pack the order. So QC is followed by PO. Then PO is followed by GSL, which is followed by D, which is followed by IC, which is followed by RP. So the Directly-Follows would be: RO -> CA CA -> RI RI -> PI PI -> QC QC -> PO PO -> GSL GSL -> D D -> IC IC -> RP"

So putting it all together: Equivalence: (RO, CA), (RO, IC), (RO, RP) Always Before: RO before CA, CA before RI, RI before PI, PI before QC, QC before PO, PO before GSL, GSL before D, D before IC, IC before RP. Also, RO before RI, RO before PI, etc., but the Always Before should include all necessary pairs. Wait, but in Always Before, if A is always before B, and B is always before C, then A is also before C. But to cover all necessary, perhaps we need to include all direct and indirect dependencies. Alternatively, perhaps its better to include only the direct ones, as the indirect ones can be inferred. Wait, but the Always Before constraint is that if the first activity occurs, the second has been executed previously. So for example, RO must be before all other activities. So RO before CA, RO before RI, RO before PI, RO before QC, RO before PO, RO before GSL, RO before D, RO before IC, RO before RP. But thats a lot, but perhaps necessary. Similarly, CA must be before RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP. RI must be before PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP. And so on. But that might be too extensive. Alternatively, perhaps include the direct predecessors only, as indirect ones can be inferred through transitivity. But Im not sure. The problem statement says that Always Before is if the first occurs, the second has been executed previously. So perhaps including all necessary predecessors is better. But maybe its better to include all possible pairs where A must come before B, even if they are not directly connected. But to simplify, maybe include only the direct ones, as the indirect ones can be inferred. Wait, but the Always Before constraint is that if the first activity occurs, the second has been executed previously. So for example, RO must be before all other activities. So RO before CA, RO before RI, RO before PI, RO before QC, RO before PO, RO before GSL, RO before D, RO before IC, RO before RP. But thats a lot, but perhaps necessary. Similarly, CA before RI, PI, etc. But thats a lot. Maybe the Always Before set should include all pairs where A must come before B, regardless of their position in the sequence. So for example, RO must come before D because RO is the start, D is an intermediate step. So RO before D is necessary. Similarly, CA must come before D, etc. But that would make the Always Before set quite large. Alternatively, perhaps its sufficient to include the immediate predecessors, as the rest can be inferred. But Im not sure. Maybe for the sake of this exercise, Ill include the direct predecessors only. So Always Before would be: (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP) But perhaps also include RO before all other activities, since RO is the first activity. So include (RO, CA), (RO, RI), (RO, PI), (RO, QC), (RO, PO), (RO, GSL), (RO, D), (RO, IC), (RO, RP). Similarly, CA before RI, PI, etc. But thats a lot. Maybe the Always Before set should include all pairs where A must come before B, even if theyre not directly connected. So for example, RO before QC, RO before D, etc. Alternatively, perhaps the Always Before constraints are only between consecutive activities, but that might not cover all necessary cases. I think the safest way is to include all necessary pairs where A must come before B, regardless of their position. So for example, RO must be before CA, which is before RI, and so on. So RO must be before all other activities, CA before all activities after it, etc. So the Always Before set would include: (RO, CA), (RO, RI), (RO, PI), (RO, QC), (RO, PO), (RO, GSL), (RO, D), (RO, IC), (RO, RP), (CA, RI), (CA, PI), (CA, QC), (CA, PO), (CA, GSL), (CA, D), (CA, IC), (CA, RP), (RI, PI), (RI, QC), (RI, PO), (RI, GSL), (RI, D), (RI, IC), (RI, RP), (PI, QC), (PI, PO), (PI, GSL), (PI, D), (PI, IC), (PI, RP), (QC, PO), (QC, GSL), (QC, D), (QC, IC), (QC, RP), (PO, GSL), (PO, D), (PO, IC), (PO, RP), (GSL, D), (GSL, IC), (GSL, RP), (D, IC), (D, RP), (IC, RP) Thats a lot of pairs, but it ensures that each activity occurs after all the ones before it in the sequence."

But I think in the problem statement, Always After is about A occurs after B if A occurs. So if A occurs, then B must have occurred after it. Wait, no, Always After is if the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. Wait, no, the problem statement says: - Always Before: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. - Always After: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So Always Before is A before B. Always After is A after B. Wait, no. Wait, the problem statement says: - Always Before: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. So, if A occurs, then B has occurred before A. Wait, thats not correct because in the process, A comes before B. So if A is RO and B is CA, then Always Before would mean that if RO occurs, CA has been executed before RO. But thats not the case because CA occurs after RO. So perhaps Im misunderstanding. Wait, perhaps the Always Before constraint is that if A occurs, then B must have occurred before A. So in the process, if CA occurs, then RO must have occurred before CA. So (CA, RO) would be in Always Before. Similarly, if RI occurs, then CA has occurred before RI. So (RI, CA) is in Always Before. Wait, that makes more sense. So the Always Before constraints are about dependencies where the occurrence of B depends on A. So for example, CA can only occur if RO has occurred before it. So in that case, the Always Before set would include: (CA, RO), (RI, CA), (PI, RI), (QC, PI), (PO, QC), (GSL, PO), (D, GSL), (IC, D), (RP, IC) So each activity depends on its predecessor. Similarly, the Always After constraints would be the reverse: if A occurs, then B occurs after A. So for example, if RO occurs, CA occurs after RO. So (RO, CA) is in Always After. Similarly, (CA, RI), (RI, PI), etc. So Always After would include: (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP) So thats the direct sequence."
