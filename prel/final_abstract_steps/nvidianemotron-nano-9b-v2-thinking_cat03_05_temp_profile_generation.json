But maybe SS is a one-time decision, but in multiple executions, perhaps its repeated. Hmm. OP: Order placement. Once SS is done, OP would follow. Maybe a few hours? 7200 seconds, std dev 3600. RC: Receiving components. Depends on supplier lead time. Maybe 2 days (172800), std dev 1 day. QI: Quality inspection. Could be a few hours, say 3600, std dev 1800. CA: Assembly. Time varies with complexity. Maybe 8 hours (28800), std dev 4 hours (14400). PT: Testing. Could be a day or more. 86400, std dev 3600. PK: Packaging. Maybe 2 hours (7200), std dev 1 hour. WS: Warehouse storage. This could vary. Maybe 1 day (86400), std dev 2 days. DT: Distribution. Shipping time, maybe 3 days (259200), std dev 1 day. AS: After-sales. This is after distribution, so maybe weeks? But since its part of the process execution, perhaps the time here is the time until support is initiated. Maybe 7 days (604800), std dev 3 days."
