These all seem to be about getting the material ready. So, this could be 'Material Preparation.'\n2. Next: Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B. This is clearly welding, which is part of assembly.\n3. Then: Measure weld integrity. This is a quality check right after welding.\n4. After that: Apply protective coating, Dry coating. This seems like finishing or coating the product.\n5. Finally: Visual check. Another quality assurance step."
