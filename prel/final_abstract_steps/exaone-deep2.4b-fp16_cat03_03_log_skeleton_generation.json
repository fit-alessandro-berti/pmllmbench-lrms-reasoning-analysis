    "Text": "Starting with the equivalence constraint. Let me think again. The problem says equivalence is: If the first activity occurs, then it has the same occurrences as the second one. Wait, perhaps that's a mistranslation and it's supposed to be that the first activity must occur exactly the same number of times as the second? That doesn't make much sense. Alternatively, maybe equivalence here means that whenever the first activity occurs, the second must also occur, and vice versa? Or maybe equivalence is that two activities must have the same occurrence count? For example, if RO occurs once, then CA must also occur once? That seems odd. Alternatively, maybe equivalence here refers to some other relationship."

So the pairs would be each consecutive activity in the sequence. So (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP). These are the direct-follows pairs. Wait, but the problem's always_after is a separate key. Wait the problem says always_after: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. Wait, the wording is ambiguous. The directly_follows constraint is If the first activity occurs, then the second activity shall occur immediately after. So directly_follows is for immediate execution, while always_after allows the second activity to occur later, not necessarily immediately. But in the scenario's process, the activities must be in immediate sequence."
