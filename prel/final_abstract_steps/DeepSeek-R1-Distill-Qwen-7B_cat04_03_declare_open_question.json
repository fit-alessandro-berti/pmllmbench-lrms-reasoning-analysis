    "Text": "Starting with the existence section Receive application A This is the initial step where the customer submits a loan application Its a must have activity so support and confidence are both 1 0 Theres no alternative here so its an existence activity Gather additional documented C After receiving the application the next step is to gather additional documents Support is 1 0 confidence 1 0 Theres no alternative so this is mandatory Proceed_without_compliance Z This is the action that should never happen Its an absence activity so its prohibited Exactly_one B This ensures that the preliminary credit check is done exactly once Its a constraint to prevent multiple credit checks which could lead to over checking or compliance issues Moving to the init section Receive_Application A This is the initial step again so its mandatory upon starting the process The responded_existence section Assemble Loan Offer Package D After receiving the application and gathering documents the next step is to assemble the loan offer package Support and confidence are 1 0 indicating this is a must do step Target Authorize_Contract_Terms F This means that after assembling the offer the next step is to get the contract terms approved before transferring funds The coexistence section Gather Addl Documents C This activity is in coexistence with authorizing contract terms So gathering documents occurs in parallel with authorizing the terms meaning both can happen simultaneously but theyre connected The response section Receive_Application A This is a response to the initial application Support and confidence are 1 0 indicating a direct relationship Target Preliminary Credit Check B So responding to the application directly leads to conducting the credit check The precedence section Quality_Assurance_Review E Target Authorize_Contract_Terms F This means that after quality assurance the contract terms need to be authorized before they can be finalized Target Gather Addl Documents C Quality review also leads to gathering additional documents which makes sense because thorough reviews might identify needed documents The succession section Preliminary Credit Check B Target Gather Addl Documents C After the credit check the next step is to gather documents ensuring that the credit check was done properly before moving on The alternative response altresponse Transfer_Funds G Target Notify_Customer H If everything is processed correctly the funds are transferred and then the customer is notified Target Notify_Customer H This seems a bit unclear Maybe it means that transferring funds leads to notification but also that transfer and notification can happen without other steps hence the altresponse The alternative precedence altprecedence Notify_Customer H Target Transfer_Funds G So if the customer is notified the next step is to transfer funds This makes sense because notification is a step before disbursing The alternative succession altsuccession Gather_Additional_Documents C Target Quality_Assurance_Review E If additional documents are gathered then quality review is next This ensures that all documents are checked before moving forward The chain response chainresponse Assemble Loan Offer Package D Target Transfer_Funds G After assembling the offer package the funds are transferred This would logically follow since the offer is ready to disburse"
