Wait check: P001 had PreliminaryScore=720 and approved; but then U001 also had PreliminaryScore=720, but received +10 bonus making it effectively 730 and was also approved. The difference is that in the unprotected group, the bonus applied to those with a community group membership can lead to more positive outcomes. even though one applicant from Group B with preliminary score 695 becomes adjusted to 705 which then qualifies for approval while in Group A similar case (710 not adjusting) was rejected."

The bias is exhibited by the log for Group B (Unprotected Group), as it shows additional score adjustments that boost effective scores, leading to more favorable final decisions. That means applicants from Group B are systematically favored because of these factors while those in Group A (Protected) do not receive the same treatment."
