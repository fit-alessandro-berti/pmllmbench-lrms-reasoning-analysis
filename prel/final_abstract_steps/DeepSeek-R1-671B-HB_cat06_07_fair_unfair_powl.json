Those who pass go to the Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check. Here's where the bias is: applicants in certain groups get a different path.

For example, ResumeParsing = Transition(label=\"ResumeParsing\"), etc.\n\nSo, for the first model:\n\nResumeParsing = Transition(label=\"ResumeParsing\")\nRequestMoreInfo = Transition(label=\"RequestMoreInfo\")\nSkillAssessment = Transition(label=\"SkillAssessment\")\nCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label=\"CulturalFitCheck\")\nCommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label=\"CommunityAffiliationCheck\")\nManagerialReview = Transition(label=\"ManagerialReview\")\nFinalDecision = Transition(label=\"FinalDecision\")\n\nThe loop is OperatorPOWL(Operator.LOOP, [ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])\n\nThe XOR is OperatorPOWL(Operator.XOR, [CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])\n\nThen the root is StrictPartialOrder with nodes: loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.

    "Text": "So putting it all together in code for both models.\n\nLet me verify again the steps.\n\nFirst model's steps:\n\n1. ResumeParsing (loop with RequestMoreInfo until data is complete)\n2. SkillAssessment\n3. XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck\n4. ManagerialReview\n5. FinalDecision\n\nSecond model's steps:\n\n1. ResumeParsing loop as before\n2. SkillAssessment\n3. CulturalFitCheck (for everyone)\n4. ManagerialReview\n5. FinalDecision\n\nYes, that's correct.\n\nSo the code should reflect this. Each POWL model is built using the appropriate operators and partial orders.\n\nAlso, need to make sure that in the first model, after the XOR, both paths lead to ManagerialReview, so the XOR is followed by ManagerialReview which is then followed by FinalDecision. So the order in the StrictPartialOrder would have edges connecting the XOR to ManagerialReview, and ManagerialReview to FinalDecision.\n\nSimilarly, in the second model, CulturalFitCheck is followed by ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision.\n\nI think that's all. Now, coding this in the format as per the example provided.\n\nThe example given in the user's instructions constructs a loop and XOR, then combines them into a StrictPartialOrder. So the same approach would be taken here.\n\nFor the first model (with unfairness):\n\nimport pm4py\nfrom pm4py.objects.powl.obj import StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition\nfrom pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj import Operator\n\n# Define all activities as Transitions\nResumeParsing = Transition(label=\"ResumeParsing\")\nRequestMoreInfo = Transition(label=\"RequestMoreInfo\")\nSkillAssessment = Transition(label=\"SkillAssessment\")\nCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label=\"CulturalFitCheck\")\nCommunityAffiliationCheck = Transition(label=\"CommunityAffiliationCheck\")\nManagerialReview = Transition(label=\"ManagerialReview\")\nFinalDecision = Transition(label=\"FinalDecision\")\n\n# Create the loop for ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo\nloop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])\n\n# Create XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck\nxor = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck])\n\n# Build the partial order: loop -> SkillAssessment -> xor -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision\nroot_unfair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, xor, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])\nroot_unfair.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)\nroot_unfair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, xor)\nroot_unfair.order.add_edge(xor, ManagerialReview)\nroot_unfair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)\n\nFor the second model (without unfairness):\n\n# Use the same activities except no CommunityAffiliationCheck and XOR is replaced by CulturalFitCheck\n# loop remains the same\nloop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[ResumeParsing, RequestMoreInfo])\n\n# No XOR, just CulturalFitCheck in sequence\nCulturalFitCheck = Transition(label=\"CulturalFitCheck\")\n\nroot_fair = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision])\nroot_fair.order.add_edge(loop, SkillAssessment)\nroot_fair.order.add_edge(SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck)\nroot_fair.order.add_edge(CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview)\nroot_fair.order.add_edge(ManagerialReview, FinalDecision)\n\nYes, that seems correct. The second model removes the XOR and CommunityAffiliationCheck, replacing it with the CulturalFitCheck in sequence.\n\nI need to make sure that in the second model, the CulturalFitCheck is a single Transition, not part of an XOR. So the steps are sequential: loop, SkillAssessment, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision.\n\nThat's the approach. The code for both models should represent these structures."
