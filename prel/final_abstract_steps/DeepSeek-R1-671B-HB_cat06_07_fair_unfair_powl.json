    "Text": "First, I need to understand the original process. Let me break down the steps mentioned. The process starts with submitting resumes and a questionnaire. Then there's Resume Parsing & Initial Data Check. If data is missing, there's a loop to request more info. Once the resume is complete, they proceed to Preliminary Skill Assessment. Those who pass go to the Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check. Here's where the bias is: applicants in certain groups get a different path. It's an XOR choice between standard cultural fit and one that gives a boost based on affiliations. Then comes Managerial Review and Final Decision."

    "Text": "For the first model (with unfairness), I need to represent this XOR branch. So after the Skill Assessment, there should be a choice between two paths. One is the standard CulturalFitCheck, and the other is CommunityAffiliationCheck which gives an advantage. The ManagerialReview comes after that."

    "Text": "Wait, but how is the XOR triggered? The description says it's an XOR choice in the process, so either you go through standard cultural fit or the community-based path. So after the skill assessment, the process branches. The XOR operator would have two children: one path for the standard check, and another for the affiliation check. Then both paths lead to the ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. So the structure would be SkillAssessment followed by XOR(CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck), then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision in sequence."

    "Text": "Let me verify again the steps. First model's steps: 1. ResumeParsing (loop with RequestMoreInfo until data is complete) 2. SkillAssessment 3. XOR between CulturalFitCheck and CommunityAffiliationCheck 4. ManagerialReview 5. FinalDecision. Second model's steps: 1. ResumeParsing loop as before 2. SkillAssessment 3. CulturalFitCheck (for everyone) 4. ManagerialReview 5. FinalDecision. Yes, that's correct."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "For the second model (without unfairness), the CommunityAffiliationCheck is removed. All applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck. So the XOR is eliminated. After SkillAssessment, everyone does CulturalFitCheck, then ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. So the structure would be loop -> SkillAssessment -> CulturalFitCheck -> ManagerialReview -> FinalDecision."
