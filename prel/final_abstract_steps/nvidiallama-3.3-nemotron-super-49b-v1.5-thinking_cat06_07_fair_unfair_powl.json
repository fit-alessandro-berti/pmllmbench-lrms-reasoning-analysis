    "Text": "I need to check if the loop is correctly modeled. The loop is between DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo. So the process is: check data, if incomplete, request more info, then check again. The loop continues until data is complete. In POWL terms, the loop operator between A and B means execute A, then decide to exit or execute B and loop back to A. So the DataCompletenessCheck is the first step, then if data is incomplete, RequestMoreInfo is executed, then back to DataCompletenessCheck. That seems correct. Yes, thats how the loop operator works. So the loop is correctly represented."

The CommunityAffiliationCheck is where the bias is introduced, as applicants with certain affiliations get a better evaluation. In the model, its just a different path, but the presence of this branch allows for the bias. In the second model, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck, so no special treatment based on community."
