    "Text": "Case 2: Normative violations: Risk Assessment before Credit Check violates ordering rule. Finalize Documentation after rejection violates rule that no finalization after rejection. Also missing Inform Applicant before closing? Actually they didnt inform applicant; they did finalize doc then close case. So also missing Inform Applicant step after decision (but maybe not mandatory? Its part of sequence). So normative violation includes skipping Inform Applicant and finalizing doc incorrectly. Desiderata: Not relevant because already normative violation."

All steps present in order, no skipping or reversing. No contradictory actions. Desiderata violations: Credit Check >24 hours after application (3 days). Violation of recommended time window. Inform Applicant >48 hours after decision (decision at 12:00 on Jan14, inform at 15:00 Jan16 = ~51 hours). Violation of recommended promptness. No Follow-up Call before closing case; optional but recommended."

    "Text": "Interpretations/justifications: Case2 might be due to system error or manual override; risk assessment performed early due to urgent need; credit check delayed due to data retrieval issues; finalization done mistakenly by staff unaware of policy; could be a training issue or miscommunication. Case3 might be due to backlog, high volume causing delays; credit check delayed because external data source slow; inform applicant delayed due to internal review or scheduling constraints; follow-up call omitted due to resource constraints or oversight."

Let's craft answer accordingly with bullet points and explanation per case. Let's produce answer with sections Normative Violations, Desiderata Violations, Interpretations. Use tables maybe summarizing each case status. Ok produce final answer accordingly."
