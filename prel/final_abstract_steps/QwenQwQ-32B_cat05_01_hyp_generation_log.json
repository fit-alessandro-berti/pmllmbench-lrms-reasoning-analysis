Also, the timestamp for the Confirm Shipment is 2024-02-01 08:25:00 which is earlier than the Credit Check at 09:10:00. ... the Confirm Shipment (event 9 at 08:25) is before the Credit Check.

So missing Validate Stock and also the step after Credit Check should be Validate Stock. In 1003, Credit Check Ship Goods is an issue...
