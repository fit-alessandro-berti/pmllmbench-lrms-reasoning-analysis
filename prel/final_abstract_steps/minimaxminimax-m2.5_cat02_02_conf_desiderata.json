They ask: 1. Identify which cases are violating the normative rules and explain the reasons. 2. Identify which cases fail to meet the desiderata conditions. - Clarify that while these deviations are not severe, they represent suboptimal behavior. 3. When possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for the observed behaviors in line with the given constraints and recommendations. Thus, we need to answer the three parts."

Risk Assessment must occur before Loan Decision. Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. If loan is approved, Finalize Documentation must occur before Close Case.

All constraints satisfied. Check also that Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes. Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes. Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes. For approved, Finalize Documentation before Close: yes. Also no finalization after rejection because its approved. So case 1 meets all normative rules."

Theres no Inform Applicant at all. Actually normative says after loan decision, you must inform applicant. That is missing. Also normative order: Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment; here its reversed (Risk Assessment occurs before Credit Check). Also normative says: If loan is rejected, you must not finalize documentation before closing; but they do finalize documentation after a rejection (10:00). And they also didnt inform applicant. So normative violations: The ordering constraints: Credit Check before Risk Assessment is violated; also the sequence: after loan decision, must inform applicant (missing); finalization after rejection (should not be done)."

Theres also no Follow-up Call. Check ordering: Credit Check before Risk Assessment: yes; Risk Assessment before Loan Decision: yes; Inform Applicant after Loan Decision: yes; Finalize Documentation before Close: yes; Also there is no rejection, so finalization is allowed. normative: after loan decision you must inform applicant; yes they did. Sequence is correct. Theres no violation of normative ordering. They also didnt do a Follow-up Call but thats a desideratum, not normative. So case 3 meets normative."

They are recommended but not strict: - It is preferred that Credit Check is completed within a short time window after the application is received (e.g., within 24 hours), and that the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision). It is also encouraged—but not strictly required—to perform a Follow-up Call to the applicant sometime before closing the case, just to ensure all parties are aligned."

Interpretation: maybe they wanted to provide closure documentation for rejected case for legal reasons, but normative says no finalization, so its a violation. For case 3: perhaps due to resource constraints: credit check delayed because of high volume; inform delayed due to internal process; follow-up not done due to oversight."
