Each case has a series of activities with different timestamps, resources, and additional contexts. My goal is to identify activities that appear more than once in a single case and determine how their meaning changes based on when and where they occur."

    "Text": "Let me start by examining each case one by one. Case C001: 'Verify Documents' appears twice. The first 'Verify Documents' happens at 9:20, by a BackOfficeAgent, checking identity documents. Then, after a 'Call Customer' by FrontlineAgent, another 'Verify Documents' at 10:30 by BackOfficeAgent again, re-checking now that the ID scan is provided. So, the first 'Verify Documents' is an initial check, and the second one is a follow-up after the customer submitted additional docs. So, their contexts differ, hence they should be renamed differently."

So, the first call is part of the initial issue resolution, the second is a follow-up. So, they should be renamed to reflect their different purposes."

So, maybe name them 'Initial Document Verification' and 'Follow-up Document Verification'."
