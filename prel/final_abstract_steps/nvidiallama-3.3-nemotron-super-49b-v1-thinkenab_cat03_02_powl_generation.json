The loop structure here: BNC is done first, then DR. The loop node (Operator.LOOP) would have children BNC and DR. Wait, according to the problem statement, the loop is between BNC and DR. So the loop is structured such that you do BNC, then either exit the loop or do DR and then loop back to BNC again. So the loop node would have BNC as the first child and DR as the second. The loop operator in POWL is represented as (A, B), meaning A is executed, then choice to exit or do B and loop back to A. So in this case, A is BNC, B is DR. So the OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP and children [BNC, DR]."
