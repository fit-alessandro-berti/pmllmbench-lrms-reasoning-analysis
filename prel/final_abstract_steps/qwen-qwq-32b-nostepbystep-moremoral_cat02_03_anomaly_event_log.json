    "Text": "Starting with Case 1001 The first activity is Create Purchase Requisition followed by its approval then issuing a Purchase Order PO That seems normal Next receiving goods comes before the invoice is received Wait usually the invoice is sent by the vendor after delivery so receiving goods before the invoice makes sense Then after receiving the invoice they match it to the PO then release payment and close the case That looks okay The timeline also seems reasonable moving from requisition to payment in a few days So maybe 1001 is standard"

    "Text": "The goods were received after the payment which also seems odd Usually you receive goods before paying but sometimes invoices come after Wait but payment should be after matching the invoice and confirming goods receipt Here they paid before matching Because in 1002 after the invoice they release payment immediately then later on the next day they receive the goods Thats a problem because releasing payment before confirming that the goods were received and matched could lead to paying for something that wasnt delivered or not properly verified The Match Invoice to PO step comes after the payment which is backwards Normally you match the invoice to the PO and confirm goods received before paying So the payment here was released without proper checks which is a major issue Thats a breach of internal controls possibly leading to fraud or overpayment"
