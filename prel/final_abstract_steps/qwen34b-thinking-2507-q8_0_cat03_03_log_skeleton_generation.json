Always After: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So, A B (B happens after A, but not necessarily immediately). Wait, maybe Always After means that after A happens, B must happen in the next event. No, the problem says: the second activity is executed in one of the following events. Hmm, maybe following events here means the next events, so after A, B must occur in some subsequent event. But I think in process mining terms, Always After would mean that B must occur after A, but not necessarily immediately. Wait, but the Directly-Follows is for immediate next."

Pack Order (PO) 7. Generate Shipping Label (GSL) 8. Dispatch (D) 9. Invoice Customer (IC) 10. Record Payment (RP). But maybe some activities can be done in different orders, or have constraints. Wait, the scenario says: When a new customer order arrives at the warehouse management system, it must be processed through a series of activities... So, the process starts with RO (Receive Order), then CA (Check Availability), then RI (Reserve Items), then PI (Pick Items), then QC (Quality Check), then PO (Pack Order), then GSL (Generate Shipping Label), then D (Dispatch), then IC (Invoice Customer), then RP (Record Payment)."

So, for example, RO happens once per order, CA once, etc. So the activ_freq would be each activity allowed to have 1 occurrence. Wait, but the example given in the problem statement shows {'A': {0,1}, 'B': {1,2}}, so maybe for some activities, they can have 0 or more? ... I think the safest assumption here is that each activity occurs exactly once, so activ_freq has each activity with {1}."

    "Text": "Let me look for similar examples online. In process mining, the log skeleton typically captures the order constraints. For example, in a sequence like A B C, the log skeleton would have: - Always Before: (B, A), (C, B), - Directly Follows: (A, B), (B, C), - Always After: (A, B), (A, C), (B, C).

No, the problem distinguishes it from Directly-Follows. ... So following events implies that it's after, not immediately. So it's a general constraint. But in the absence of more information, I'll assume that the problem expects the following: - The always_after set is empty because the process is linear and the Always Before covers the order. But that doesn't make sense. ... I think the best approach is to provide the dictionary with the following: - equivalence: empty, - always_before: predecessor pairs, - always_after: empty (but this is a guess), - never_together: empty, - activ_freq: {1} for all, - directly_follows: consecutive pairs"
