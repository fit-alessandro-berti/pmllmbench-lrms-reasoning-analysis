Lets list the events with their readings: Event 1: 08:00:00 - Temp 20, Press 1, Vib 0, Flow 0, Tool 0, Energy 0.50 Event 2: 08:00:05 - Temp 20, Press 1, Vib 0, Flow 0, Tool 0, Energy 0.40 Event 3: 08:00:10 - Temp 21, Press 1, Vib 0, Flow 0, Tool 0, Energy 0.45 These three events have low values across all sensors. Possibly they are a startup or idle phase."

Material flow is constant at 5 units/s. This could be a cutting operation? Or maybe a drilling? The tool position is moving from 5 to 10, so tool is advancing. Vibration and temperature are high. Possibly cutting or milling."

This might be a different activity, maybe assembling or material insertion? Or maybe its a transition. But note: tool position is constant at 15, so maybe its holding position?"

So they might be the same phase at the beginning and end. Lets call it Machine Idle or Standby. 2. Cutting/Machining: Events 4-6 show increasing tool position, high vibration, moderate temperature, material flow constant. This could be Cutting Metal or Machining. 3. Assembling or something: Events 7-8... Lets call it Assembling/Pressing. 4. Welding: Event 9... 5. Cooling/Post-welding: Event 10... 6. Quality Inspection or Packaging? Events 11-12: ... Lets call it Packaging for now. 7. Machine Idle/Shutdown (Events 13-15)"

    "Text": "Activity 1: Machine Idle (Events 1-3 and 13-15) - Rationale: All sensor readings are at baseline: low temperature (20-21C), no pressure, no vibration, no material flow, tool at zero position, and low energy consumption (~0.4-0.5 kWh). This indicates the machine is in a standby or startup phase before production begins. Activity 2: Cutting Metal (Events 4-6) - Rationale: There is a sharp increase in temperature (50-58C), moderate pressure (1-1.5 bar), high vibration (30-38 Hz), constant material flow (5 units/s), and tool position advancing (5-10 mm). This pattern is typical of a machining operation where material is being removed, requiring energy and generating heat and vibration. Activity 3: Assembling Parts (Events 7-8) - Rationale: Temperature and vibration decrease (40C, 10 Hz), but pressure increases to 2 bar, material flow drops to 2 units/s, and tool position remains constant at 15 mm. This could indicate a pressing or assembling operation where the tool holds a part in place while applying pressure, with less movement and heat. Activity 4: Welding (Event 9) - Rationale: This event shows a peak in temperature (80C), vibration (50 Hz), and energy consumption (5.00 kWh), with zero material flow and tool stationary. This is characteristic of welding, where high energy is used to join materials, generating intense heat and vibration. Activity 5: Cooling (Event 10) - Rationale: Following welding, temperature drops to 30C, pressure returns to 1 bar, vibration negligible, and energy decreases to 1.00 kWh. This indicates a cooling period where the welded joint solidifies and the machine returns to a lower power state. Activity 6: Packaging (Events 11-12) - Rationale: Tool position moves to 20 mm, material flow resumes at 1 unit/s, temperature and vibration remain low, and energy consumption is moderate (1.5-1.6 kWh). This could represent packaging or final processing, where the product is moved and prepared for shipping."
