I'm not super familiar with process mining, but I understand that it's about analyzing business processes by looking at event logs. The goal here is to convert the raw log into a format that can be used by process mining tools, which usually means having case IDs, activity names, timestamps, and possibly other attributes."

So, each window (like Document1.docx, Quarterly_Report.docx, Email - Inbox, Report_Draft.pdf, Budget_2024.xlsx) is a separate case.
