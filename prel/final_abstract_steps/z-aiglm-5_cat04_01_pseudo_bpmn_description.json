This is a conditional loop based on the *source* of the process instance. I need to explain that the model implies a context-dependent loop. In strict BPMN, this might be modeled with a sub-process or distinct merging flows, but in this pseudo-code, I must describe the intended business logic: Rework targets the specific activity relevant to the request type. * *Clarification:* The diagram implies that after Task D Standard or Task E1 Custom, the flow merges. I should state that clearly."

This matches the structure of the prompts questions."
