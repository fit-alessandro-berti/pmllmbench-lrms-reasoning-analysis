The user provided an event log with three cases and wants a process tree that captures the main flow, the optional loop for Request Missing Info (RMI) and Re-Validation (VF), and the final steps. First, I need to analyze the event log to understand the sequence and possible loops. Lets look at each case: Case 1: RA VF AE RMI VF AD SC AC Case 2: RA VF AE AD SC AC (no RMI here) Case 3: RA VF AE RMI (twice) VF AD SC AC"

That suggests that the loop may involve RMI, followed by the choice to do another RMI or proceed. Wait this might complicate things. Alternatively, perhaps each RMI must be followed by a VF, but can have multiple RMI-F pairs? Wait in case 3, after the two RMIs, they have a VF. So the sequence is RMI, RMI, then VF.
