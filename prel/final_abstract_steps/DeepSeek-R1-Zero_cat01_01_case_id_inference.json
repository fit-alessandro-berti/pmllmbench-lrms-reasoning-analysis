However, a key part of this reasoning is that no two events belonging to the same case should have conflicting `patient_age` and `patient_gender` attributes. Thus, events are grouped based on a unique pair of `patient_age` and `patient_gender` values until a \"Patient discharged\" event indicates the likely end of a case."
