Ill look at the timestamps for each case to compute the time taken. Starting with Case 2001: Submit at 2024-04-01 09:00, Close at 2024-04-01 10:30. Thats 30 minutes total."

Case 2003: Submit Apr 1 09:10, Close Apr 3 09:30. ... Total 48h20m. Case 2004: Submit Apr 1 09:20, Close Apr 1 10:45 25 minutes. Case 2005: Submit Apr 1 09:25, Close Apr 4 14:30 ... total 77h5m."
