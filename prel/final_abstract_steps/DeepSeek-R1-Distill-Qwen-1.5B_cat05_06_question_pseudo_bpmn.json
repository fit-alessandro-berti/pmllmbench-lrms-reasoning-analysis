The user provided a detailed process and wants 20 questions that delve into various aspects like rationale, improvements, risk management, decision-making, communication, and performance measurement. I need to make sure each question is open-ended, not just a yes/no or definition question."

    "Text": "First, I should understand the process better. Starting from the start event, there's a Market Research Task, then R&D, split into Secure Components, which have several tasks. Then they ship to Malaysia, assemble, quality checks, rework or scrap, pack and label, split again into air freight and cargo ship, customs clearance, distribution to various markets, then monitor inventory and sales forecast, and finally adjust orders and proceed to next cycle."

    "Text": "I need to think about each part of the process. For the rationale, maybe ask about the importance of each task because of supply chain challenges. For improvements, think about how to optimize each step. Risks could involve delays or quality issues. Decision-making might center around choosing suppliers or processes. Communication would involve how to effectively share information. Performance measurement could be about tracking metrics or success metrics."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should also consider the flow of the process. For example, why split the Secure Components into different tasks? Or why after quality checks, they proceed to rework or scrap. Each of these points can lead to questions about the rationale, potential problems, and solutions."

    "Text": "I also need to ensure each question is unique and covers different angles. Maybe mix in questions about the process's effectiveness, possible enhancements, and how to handle different scenarios."
