Absence: Z never happens, ensuring no shortcuts that violate rules. Exactly one: B happens once, so only one preliminary credit check per application. Init: Process starts with A. Response: A responds with B, so after receiving application, do credit check. Succession: B followed by C, so credit check then gather documents. Precedence: E before F, quality review before authorizing terms. Chainresponse, etc.: More complex sequences, like D leads to G, etc."
