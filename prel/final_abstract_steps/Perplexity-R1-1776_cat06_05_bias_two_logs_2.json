There are two groups: Group A (Protected) and Group B (Unprotected). The main difference seems to be that Group B has a score adjustment for candidates affiliated with the LocalBusinessLeadersClub, giving them a +5 boost in CulturalFit."

For example, P001 has a CulturalFit of 65, and the decision is Hired. P002 has 60 and Not Hired, P003 has 65 and Hired. The SkillScores are 85, 78, 82 respectively. So hiring decisions here might be based on SkillScore, PersonalityScore, and CulturalFit without any adjustments."
