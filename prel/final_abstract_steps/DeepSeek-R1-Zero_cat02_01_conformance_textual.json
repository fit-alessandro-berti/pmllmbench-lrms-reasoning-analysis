After receiving an order, the \"Check inventory\" step should occur next.\n3. Based on the result of the inventory check, the process branches into two possible flows:\n    \n    - If the inventory is sufficient:\n        - \"Check inventory\" should be followed by \"Authorize payment.\"\n        - After \"Authorize payment,\" the next step should be \"Package items.\"\n        - After \"Package items,\" the next step should be \"Ship order.\"\n        - Finally, \"Ship order\" should be followed by \"Close order.\"\n        - Thus, the expected sequence for sufficient inventory would be:\n            `Receive order  Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order`\n\n    - If the inventory is insufficient:\n        - \"Check inventory\" should be followed by \"Cancel order.\"\n        - After \"Cancel order,\" the next step should be \"Close order.\"\n        - Thus, the expected sequence for insufficient inventory would be:\n            `Receive order  Check inventory  Cancel order  Close order`\n    \n4. \"Authorize payment\" should only occur after \"Check inventory\" and before \"Package items.\"\n5. \"Package items\" should only occur after \"Authorize payment\" and before \"Ship order.\"\n6. \"Ship order\" should only occur after \"Package items\" and never after a \"Cancel order.\"\n7. \"Close order\" should be the final activity in all cases."

It seems like a part of the \"sufficient inventory\" flow has been mixed here.\n- Another important point here is that \"Ship order\" should only occur after \"Package items.\" However, \"Package items\" is completely absent here. Also, \"Ship order\" should never occur after \"Cancel order.\"\n\nThis makes **Case 3 a violation of the normative process description**. It seems that the order was canceled, yet \"Ship order\" was still executed."

The order here should be \"Check inventory  Authorize payment  Package items  Ship order  Close order.\"\n\n**Case 3:**\n- Violations:\n  - \"Authorize payment\" seems to be done even though the order was canceled (which usually happens if the inventory check shows insufficient stock).\n  - \"Ship order\" should not occur after \"Cancel order,\" and should only occur if \"Package items\" has been done. Any \"Cancel order\" should be followed only by \"Close order,\" so \"Ship order\" is out of place here.\n\n**Case 5:**\n- Violation: \"Package items\" should occur between \"Authorize payment\" and \"Ship order,\" but the \"Package items\" step is completely missing.\n\nBased on this reasoning, cases 2, 3, and 5 violate the normative process description. Case 1 and case 4 appear to follow the described process correctly."
