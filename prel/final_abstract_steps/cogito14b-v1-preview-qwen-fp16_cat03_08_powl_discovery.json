After that, IQC (In-line Quality Check) occurs once or multiple times. If a product fails, it goes through RT (Re-Testing), which loops back to TST (Testing). Once passed, PK (Packaging) and LB (Labeling) are done. Sometimes LB is skipped. Then DP (Distribution Planning) and finally D (Dispatch)."

    "Text": "Let me structure this: 1. OR is the start. 2. MS comes after OR, then QS. 3. AS happens once after QS. 4. IQC is in a loop with AS, maybe using a loop operator. 5. Then TST occurs, followed by possible RT looping back to TST until passing. 6. After successful testing, PK and LB are sequential but LB can be skipped (XOR choice with tau). 7. Finally, DP and D. I need to use StrictPartialOrder for the main flow, loop operators where necessary, and XOR for optional steps like LB."
