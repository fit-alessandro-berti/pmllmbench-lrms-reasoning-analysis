The activities in each case seem to follow a similar sequence but with some variations, especially around the Request Missing Info (RMI) activity which occurs twice in some cases. Also, there's a Validate Form (VF) after RMI, which might indicate re-validation."

    "Text": "Case 3's activities after AE are RMI (9:25), then another RMI (9:45), then VF (10:20). So between the two RMI's, there's no other activity except the second RMI. So perhaps the loop allows multiple RMI steps before exiting, followed by re-validation (VF)."

    "Text": "If AE is always followed by a loop allowing one or more RMI activities, then exiting the loop with VF makes sense. Analyzing all cases, this loop seems to generalize well: one loop iteration for Case 1, two loop iterations for Case 3, etc."
