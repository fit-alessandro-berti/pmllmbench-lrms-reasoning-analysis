The 'existence' constraint for 'Receive_Application' and 'Gather_Additional_Documents' means that whenever an application is received, those steps must occur. Wait, or does existence mean that the activity must occur in all cases? The declare website says existence means the activity is executed in all cases."

So, once the application is received, a credit check must follow. The 'precedence' of 'Quality_Assurance_Review' over 'Authorize_Contract_Terms' ensures QA comes before authorizing terms. That makes sense because you can't approve terms without a review."

Hmm, maybe in some cases, but according to this model, the credit check comes first. That could be to determine if more docs are needed based on the credit check."

Possibly ensuring that once documents are gathered, the contract terms are then approved, linking those steps."

The strict sequence prevents shortcuts and ensures transparency since each step is followed in order, providing auditable procedures."
