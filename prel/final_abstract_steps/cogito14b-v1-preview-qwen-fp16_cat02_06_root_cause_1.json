    "Text": "First, I need to calculate the total resolution time for each case. Resolution time is from when the ticket was received until it was closed. Let me go through each row: Case 101: Received at 8:00 AM on March 1st, closed at 10:15 AM same day. Thats about 2 hours and 15 minutes. Case 102: Received at 8:05 AM on March 1st, closed at 9:15 AM on March 2nd. That spans almost a full day (about 25 hours). Case 103: From 8:10 AM to 9:30 AM same day. About 1 hour and 20 minutes. Case 104: Received at 8:20 AM March 1st, closed at 8:30 AM March 2nd. Almost exactly 24 hours. Case 105: From 8:25 AM March 1st to 9:30 AM March 3rd. Over two days and about 47 hours."

    "Text": "Looking at why these took so long: Case 102 was escalated to Level-2 on March 1st at 11:30 AM but didnt start investigating until 2 PM next day. Thats a big gap where nothing happened for almost 9 hours. Then resolving and closing on the second day. Case 104 also had an escalation, which took a while to resolve, spanning two days with no work done during the first night. The same as 102 but even more time from investigation to resolution (from March 1st at 3 PM to March 2nd at 8 AM). Case 105 shows multiple escalations and delays: escalated on March 1st at 9:10 AM, then next activity was investigating two days later. Even after escalation, theres a long gap before resolution happens."
