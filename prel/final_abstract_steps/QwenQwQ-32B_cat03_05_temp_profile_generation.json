Probably takes maybe 1-3 days to prepare the order once the supplier is selected. So average could be around 3 days. - OP to RC: The time suppliers take to ship. Depending on suppliers location, maybe several days to weeks. Say 7-day average, with some variability. - RC to QI: Maybe inspections are done quickly upon receipt. Hours to days. Lets estimate half a day, so 43,200 seconds (12 hours). - QI to CA: After inspection, assembly can begin. Planning and setup might take a couple days. - CA to PT: Once assembled, they need to be tested immediately, maybe a half-day period. - PT to PK: If testing passes, packaging quickly follows. Hours, like 8 hours (28,800 s). - PK to WS: Storage once packaged. Usually, they might move to storage right away, so maybe a few hours delay. - WS to DT: If items sit in storage before shipping, perhaps weeks. Lets think average a month, but with some variation. - DT to AS: After shipment, the after-sales support starts, but that might be immediately, like once delivered. However, it could also take some time for the customer to get the product and then contact support, so maybe days to weeks, but service is instant after purchase. Maybe a few days."

For example, SS to RC would be the time between selecting the supplier and receiving the components...Wait, no, the temporal distance between two activities that are not adjacent is the absolute time difference between their occurrences in a trace...Thus, all pairs must have their distance considered.
