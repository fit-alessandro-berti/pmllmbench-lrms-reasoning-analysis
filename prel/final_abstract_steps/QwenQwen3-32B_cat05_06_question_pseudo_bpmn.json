Then there's a parallel gateway where components are sourced from different countries. After securing all components, they're shipped to Malaysia for assembly. Quality checks follow, with a possible loop back to assembly if there's a failure. Then packaging and shipping via air and cargo, customs, distribution centers, and finally inventory monitoring with a decision to adjust orders or proceed."
