    "Text": "I think the first step is to identify the activities and their order in each case. Then, I can spot any variations or choices that need to be modeled with XOR. Loops seem to occur when an activity repeats, like TST possibly repeating, or other steps that loop back."

    "Text": "For example, in Case 1, after TST, theres another TST and then RT. This suggests a loop between TST and RT, but in the example code, theres a loop operator defined as * with A and B, meaning after executing A, you can either exit or execute B and loop back to A. So, in this case, maybe TST and RT form a loop."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then, after the loop, the process continues with PK, LB, D. But LB is optional, as seen in Case 2 where its skipped. So, LB can be skipped, meaning its a silent activity, perhaps modeled with a SilentTransition."
