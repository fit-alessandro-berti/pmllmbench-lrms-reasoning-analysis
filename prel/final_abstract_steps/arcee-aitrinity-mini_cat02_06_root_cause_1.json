Thats 25 hours 10 minutes (since 08:05 to 24:00 is 15h55m, then 00:00 to 09:15 is 9h15m, total 25h10m).

Also, the ticket was received on 2024-03-01 08:25, close on 2024-03-03 09:30. But in terms of resolution time, its still from start to end, which I have as 49h5m. From 2024-03-01 08:25 to 2024-03-03 09:30: Days: 2 (March 1 to 3 is 2 days, but since start is after midnight, better to use total hours. From 08:25 March 1 to 24:00 March 1: 15h35m (24 - 08:25 = 15h35m). March 2 full day: 24h. From 00:00 March 3 to 09:30: 9h30m. Total: 15h35m + 24h + 9h30m = 48h65m = 49h5m. Yes."

Case 103 is short (1h20m), Case 101 is 2h15m, Case 102 is 25h10m. But Case 105 is much longer. Also, Case 104 is long at 24h10m. I should convert all to minutes for comparison. Case 101: 2h15m = 135 minutes Case 102: 25h10m = 1510 minutes Case 103: 1h20m = 80 minutes Case 104: 24h10m = 1450 minutes Case 105: 49h5m = 2945 minutes? 49*60 = 2940, plus 5 = 2945 minutes. Average: (135 + 1510 + 80 + 1450 + 2945) / 5 = lets calculate: 135 + 1510 = 1645 1645 + 80 = 1725 1725 + 1450 = 3175 3175 + 2945 = 6120 Total: 6120 minutes for 5 cases.

Root cause: Long waiting times before investigation. Specifically, from Assign to Escalate: 2h30m, and Escalate to Investigate: 2h30m.

Root causes: Long waiting between Assign and Escalate (50 min) Long waiting between Escalate and Investigate (from 10:00 to 14:00 is 4 hours, but its the same activity Investigate Issue) – this seems inefficient. Multiple investigations might indicate the issue wasnt properly diagnosed initially. Escalation to Level-2 might be premature or unnecessary."

Also, the task says cases that take significantly longer than average, and from my calculation, average is about 20.4 hours, so Case 102 (25.16 hours), 104 (24.16 hours), and 105 (49 hours) are all significantly longer. Case 101 is 2.25 hours, which is fine. So, I think 102, 104, 105 are the ones."
