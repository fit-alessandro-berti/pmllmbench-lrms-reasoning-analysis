    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "XOR is an exclusive choice; only one of the paths is taken. In this case, after the preliminary scoring (C), the process can either check local affiliation (D) or skip that step. The check for local affiliation gives a 'subtle score uplift,' which means if D is executed, the applicant's score increases, potentially affecting the final decision."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If the criteria for selecting D are based on factors that correlate with non-legally protected groups, then those groups might get the score uplift more often, giving them an unfair advantage."

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Suppose the system checks local affiliation (D) for applicants from certain zip codes that are known to have higher-income residents, which isn't a legally protected attribute. If applicants from these areas get the uplift, they might have better chances of approval or better terms, even if other factors are similar."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Perhaps the decision to check D is influenced by the preliminary score. If applicants with scores just below a threshold are routed through D, and those who pass D get a boost, this could help some applicants."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If the preliminary scoring itself has biases (even unintentional), then the uplift via D might amplify existing disparities. For instance, if preliminary scoring tends to rate certain demographics lower, giving them a chance to get a boost via D might seem fair, but if other groups are systematically routed away from D, they don't get that chance, leading to inequitable outcomes."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If the criteria for taking D are not transparent or based on variables that indirectly correlate with protected attributes (like using zip codes as a proxy for race), this could introduce indirect discrimination. Even though the group being favored isn't legally protected, the outcome might still impact protected groups negatively if there's a correlation."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "This undermines fairness because similarly situated applicants are treated differently based on factors that shouldn't affect loan decisions. Equity is impacted because the process may systematically favor certain groups over others, leading to unequal access to credit."
