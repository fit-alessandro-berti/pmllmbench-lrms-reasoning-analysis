Analyze the Request: Input: A scenario description including database schema claims adjusters claim_events, an intended process flow R to A to E to P to N to C, a temporal profile model with specific anomalies R to P, P to N, A to C, E to N, and a prompt instructing the LLM to identify anomalies, generate hypotheses, and propose SQL verification queries. Task: Act as the Target LLM. Respond to the prompt by identifying anomalies, hypothesizing causes, and providing SQL queries based on the provided schema and temporal profile. Constraint: Do not reference the instructions or explanations above. Present the content independently."

Query 1 R to P Anomaly: Find claims where P minus R is outside expected bounds e.g. less than 24 hours or greater than 26 hours given the low STDEV. Query 2 P to N Delay: Find claims where N minus P greater than 7 days or significantly high. Query 3 A to C Skip: Find claims where C minus A is very short, and check if E or P exist in between. Query 4 Resource Adjuster Correlation: Group by resource or join with adjusters to see if specific people regions correlate with anomalies."

    "Text": "8. Final Polish: Self-Correction during drafting: For the R to P query, since the STDEV is low 1 hour, most claims should be within 25 hours plus minus 3 hours. I should query for outliers outside this range or specifically look for the rigidity exact same duration. Actually, the prompt asks to identify claims where time falls outside expected ranges or correlates with conditions. I will focus on finding the outliers that break the pattern or confirm the pattern suspiciously. For A to C, I need to check if E or P occurred between A and C. For P to N, I need to find the long tails. Query Structure: WITH activity_times AS SELECT claim_id, MAX CASE WHEN activity = R THEN timestamp END as t_r, ... This is cleaner than multiple self-joins.
