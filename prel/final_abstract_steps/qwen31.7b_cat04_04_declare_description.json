The DECLARE model has various constraints like existence, absence, exactly_one, and others. Each activity has support and confidence values set to 1.0, which means they're all certain."

The process starts with Receive_Application, then Preliminary_Credit_Check, then Gather_Additional_Documents. The chain response would be Assemble_Loan_Offer_Package, followed by Quality_Assurance_Review, then Authorize_Contract_Terms, and finally Transfer_Funds and Notify_Customer. There's also a forbidden step: Proceed_Without_Compliance."
