This models: A, then if we want to repeat, we do B (which is a silent step) and then A again. However, the problem does not mention a silent step. But we can use tau for internal decisions. Alternatively, we can model the loop without a silent step? The problem says that the loop repeats until the results are normal. So the condition for repetition is embedded in the results of the RDT. We dont need to model the condition as an explicit step. But the process tree operators are defined purely by control flow. We dont model data conditions. So we use the structure to represent the repetition. Therefore, we can model the loop as: *( body, tau ) However, note that the problem says: if the results are still abnormal, the patient returns ....

So the above would do the entire loop once and then the next steps? That is not correct because the loop might run multiple times. Alternatively, we can model the loop as including the decision to continue, and then the entire loop structure already captures the repetition. But the problem says that the loop is entered only if abnormal. So if the results of the initial test are normal, we skip the loop entirely. Therefore, we must model: X( [this branch for abnormal: do the loop and then the next steps], [this branch for normal: the next steps] ) But note: the loop itself might run multiple times. The branch for abnormal should be: do the loop (which might run multiple times until normal) and then do the next steps. And the branch for normal is just the next steps. However, we cannot model that because the loop we built already runs until the condition is met? Actually, our loop operator * does not have a condition to stop? It runs at least once and then can run more if we choose to do the second child (tau) and then the body again. But the problem says: the loop continues until the results are normal. We dont know when that will be. So we have to rely on the data condition that is not represented. Alternatively, we can model the entire loop as a single step that might run multiple times? But the process tree does not have a built-in while loop. Given the constraints, we have to model the loop as: *( body, tau ) and then we assume that the body is performed at least once, and then we might do tau (meaning the results are still abnormal) and then the body again, until we decide to exit (i.e., not do tau). But the problem states that the loop is entered only if the initial test is abnormal. So we must condition the entire loop on the initial test being abnormal. Therefore, we introduce a choice after the initial test: X( [if abnormal] do_loop, [if normal] continue ) where do_loop = *( body, tau ) and continue = the next steps (which are the same for both branches) However, note: the next_steps is the same in both branches. So we can factor it out? Actually, we cannot because the next_steps must be done after the loop in the abnormal branch, and after skipping the loop in the normal branch. Alternatively, we can model: X( loop, skip_loop_with_loop_placeholder )   # but we dont have a placeholder. We can do: after_initial_test = X( ->( *(body, tau), next_steps ), next_steps ) This is correct: if abnormal, we do the loop (which runs until we exit) and then next_steps. If normal, we do next_steps."

Or we can factor it? # Alternatively, we can model skip_loop as a sequence that just does next_steps. But note: next_steps is a tree. We can set: skip_loop = next_steps   # but then skip_loop and do_loop (which is [loop_node, next_steps]) share the same next_steps node. However, we are building the tree. We can set: skip_loop = next_steps   # meaning the same tree. But then the skip_loop branch is the same node as the next_steps in the do_loop branch. This is acceptable because the next_steps is the same in both branches? However, note: the tree structure must be such that a node has only one parent. In the do_loop branch, next_steps has parent do_loop. In the skip_loop branch, we are going to put skip_loop (which is next_steps) under the choice node. So next_steps would have two parents? That is not allowed. We must duplicate the next_steps? Or we can create a new node for skip_loop that is the same as next_steps? Actually, we can build two copies of next_steps? But then we have two independent copies. Alternatively, we can model the skip_loop as a sequence that has the same children as next_steps? But we dont want to duplicate the children. We can do: # We create two sequence nodes: one for the do_loop branch (which is the one we built as next_steps) and one for the skip_loop branch (lets call it next_steps_skip). # Then we set the children of next_steps_skip to be [step5, step6, step7] (the same as next_steps). next_steps_skip = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE) next_steps_skip.children = [step5, step6, step7] step5.parent = next_steps_skip   # but step5 already has parent in next_steps? -> this is a problem. We cannot assign step5 to two parents. Therefore, we must build two separate copies of step5, step6, step7? Alternatively, we can note that the next_steps is independent of the loop. We can build: # Build the next_steps tree only once? But we need it in two places. How about we build the next_steps tree and then use it in the do_loop branch. Then for the skip_loop branch, we build a new tree that has the same structure? But that would duplicate the nodes. The model is large and we are only two branches. We can do: # Build the next_steps for the do_loop branch (we already did: next_steps) # Now, build the next_steps for the skip_loop branch: ai2 = ProcessTree(label=AI) nc2 = ProcessTree(label=NC) step5_skip = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, parent=skip_loop, children=[ai2, nc2]) ai2.parent = step5_skip nc2.parent = step5_skip fas2 = ProcessTree(label=FAS) ddi2 = ProcessTree(label=DDI) step6_skip = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[fas2, ddi2], parent=skip_loop) fas2.parent = step6_skip ddi2.parent = step6_skip bl2 = ProcessTree(label=BL) icp2 = ProcessTree(label=ICP) mrf2 = ProcessTree(label=MRF) step7_skip = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[bl2, icp2, mrf2], parent=skip_loop) bl2.parent = step7_skip icp2.parent = step7_skip mrf2.parent = step7_skip skip_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[step5_skip, step6_skip, step7_skip], parent=after_initial_test_choice) step5_skip.parent = skip_loop step6_skip.parent = skip_loop step7_skip.parent = skip_loop Then, for the do_loop branch, we have: do_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[loop_node, next_steps], parent=after_initial_test_choice) loop_node.parent = do_loop # set next_steps.parent = do_loop   (we already built next_steps with its own children, but we havent set the parent of next_steps to do_loop) However, we built next_steps as: step5 = ... step6 = ... step7 = ... next_steps = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[step5, step6, step7]) Then we set: step5.parent = next_steps step6.parent = next_steps step7.parent = next_steps And now we set next_steps.parent = do_loop # after creating do_loop And for the skip_loop branch, we set skip_loop.parent = after_initial_test_choice. 10. Now, we have: after_initial_test_choice = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, parent=root) # set its children: [do_loop, skip_loop] after_initial_test_choice.children = [do_loop, skip_loop] Then set: do_loop.parent = after_initial_test_choice skip_loop.parent = after_initial_test_choice 11. Finally, we have the entire root with children: step1, step2, step3, after_initial_test_choice. root.children = [step1, step2, step3, after_initial_test_choice] And set the parents: step1.parent = root step2.parent = root step3.parent = root after_initial_test_choice.parent = root 12. But note: the root is the top node. We have not set the children of root to step1, step2, step3, after_initial_test_choice? We must. root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE) # then we set children to [step1, step2, step3, after_initial_test_choice] step1 = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, parent=root) ... and so on. Implementation: Well build the tree from the bottom up. Note: We must use the same names for variables. Well duplicate the next_steps for the skip loop. Alternatively, we can build the skip_loop branch without duplicating the entire next_steps? We can build a single next_steps tree and then use it in both branches? But that would assign the same next_steps node to two parents? That is not allowed. Therefore, we build two independent next_steps trees. Lets code accordingly. However, note: the problem does not require two identical next_steps trees in terms of node identity. The activities are the same, but the nodes are different. This is acceptable. Given the complexity, we will build the entire tree in code. Steps: Well create the root and then the top-level sequence. Well build step1, step2, step3, and the after_initial_test_choice (which is a choice between two branches). Well build the two branches for after_initial_test_choice: branch1: do_loop = sequence(loop_node, next_steps_do_loop) branch2: skip_loop = next_steps_skip_loop   (which is a sequence of step5_skip, step6_skip, step7_skip) Well build the loop_node and the body inside the loop. Well build the next_steps_do_loop and next_steps_skip_loop separately. Well set the parent-child relationships. Well use the following variables to avoid duplication of node creation: # For the do_loop branch: sc_do = ProcessTree(label=SC) tm_do = ProcessTree(label=TM) spt_do = ProcessTree(label=SPT) tx_choice_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[tm_do, spt_do]) fce_do = ProcessTree(label=FCE) fba_do = ProcessTree(label=FBA) rdt_choice_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[fce_do, fba_do]) body_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[sc_do, tx_choice_do, rdt_choice_do]) # set parents for body_dos children sc_do.parent = body_do tx_choice_do.parent = body_do rdt_choice_do.parent = body_do # set parents for tx_choice_do and rdt_choice_dos children tm_do.parent = tx_choice_do spt_do.parent = tx_choice_do fce_do.parent = rdt_choice_do fba_do.parent = rdt_choice_do tau_loop_do = ProcessTree(label=tau) loop_node_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[body_do, tau_loop_do]) body_do.parent = loop_node_do tau_loop_do.parent = loop_node_do # next_steps_do_loop: ai_do = ProcessTree(label=AI) nc_do = ProcessTree(label=NC) step5_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[ai_do, nc_do]) ai_do.parent = step5_do nc_do.parent = step5_do fas_do = ProcessTree(label=FAS) ddi_do = ProcessTree(label=DDI) step6_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[fas_do, ddi_do]) fas_do.parent = step6_do ddi_do.parent = step6_do bl_do = ProcessTree(label=BL) icp_do = ProcessTree(label=ICP) mrf_do = ProcessTree(label=MRF) step7_do = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[bl_do, icp_do, mrf_do]) bl_do.parent = step7_do icp_do.parent = step7_do mrf_do.parent = step7_do next_steps_do_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[step5_do, step6_do, step7_do]) step5_do.parent = next_steps_do_loop step6_do.parent = next_steps_do_loop step7_do.parent = next_steps_do_loop # do_loop branch: do_loop_branch = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[loop_node_do, next_steps_do_loop]) loop_node_do.parent = do_loop_branch next_steps_do_loop.parent = do_loop_branch # For the skip_loop branch, we build similar nodes with _skip suffix. sc_skip = ProcessTree(label=SC)  # not needed? because skip_loop doesnt do SC # But we dont need the body in the skip_loop branch.

Then we set the children of root to [step1, step2, step3, after_initial_test_choice] 15. We return the root. Given the complexity, we write the code accordingly. But note: the problem does not require two independent versions of the next_steps? The next_steps is the same in both branches? In the abnormal branch, the patient has gone through the loop (multiple times) and then does next_steps. In the normal branch, the patient has not gone through the loop and then does next_steps. But the next_steps is the same set of activities. However, the nodes are different because the loop in the abnormal branch might change the patient state? In process tree modeling, we typically duplicate the nodes if they occur in different contexts. So we do. 16. Well now write the code accordingly. However, note: the problem does not mention the possibility of the loop being empty (i.e., if the initial test is normal, then the loop is skipped). Our model covers that. 17. Lets code accordingly. Due to the complexity, we break down the code step by step. Important: We must import the Operator from pm4py.objects.process_tree.obj."
