Exclusive choice (X) between Targeted Medication (TM) and Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT) c. Then, after treatment, a Re-Diagnostic Test (RDT) which is again an exclusive choice between Follow-up ECG (FCE) and Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA) The loop structure is: *( loop_body, exit_condition? ) But note: the loop operator * in the problem definition is: A is executed, then either exit the loop or do B and then A again. So we can set: A = the body of the loop (SC -> (X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA))) B = a silent step (tau) representing the decision to continue. Then the loop is: do A (which includes the entire sequence and finishes with RDT), and then we can either exit or do B (tau) and then A again. This models: A, then if we want to repeat, we do B (which is a silent step) and then A again."

If abnormal, a loop commences But note: the loop is only entered if the results are abnormal? How do we model conditionality? We cannot model conditionality with these operators without introducing silent steps for choice. We can model: X( [if abnormal] loop, [if normal] then skip the loop and go to the next step ) However, the rest is the same in both cases. So we can do: X( ->( loop, next_steps ), next_steps )"

In the skip_loop branch, we are going to put skip_loop (which is next_steps) under the choice node. So next_steps would have two parents? That is not allowed. We must duplicate the next_steps? Or we can create a new node for skip_loop that is the same as next_steps? Actually, we can build two separate copies of step5, step6, step7? Given the complexity, we decide to build two independent trees for next_steps. In process tree modeling, we typically duplicate the nodes if they occur in different contexts. So we do."
