    "Text": "Based on a logical grouping of these activities, here are the potential high-level steps:\n\n1. **Material Preparation:**\n   - Activities: \"Retrieve raw metal sheet\", \"Scan barcode\", \"Place metal sheet on table\", \"Align metal sheet\", \"Preheat metal sheet\".\n   - Rationale: These steps involve fetching the raw material, verifying it, placing it on a work table, aligning it, and preheating it. This seems to be an initial phase where the part is prepared for the next steps such as assembly or processing.\n\n2. **Assembly (Welding):**\n   - Activities: \"Pick up welding tool\", \"Weld corner A\", \"Weld corner B\".\n   - Rationale: These steps involve picking up a welding tool and performing welding actions on two corners of the metal sheet. Hence, it makes sense to group these as part of an assembly step where the actual joining of parts occurs.\n\n3. **Quality Check (Weld Integrity):**\n   - Activities: \"Measure weld integrity\".\n   - Rationale: This is a specific check for the integrity of the welds made previously. Although \"quality check\" here only includes one activity (\"Measure weld integrity\"), it makes sense to label it distinctly as a part of a quality check phase.\n\n4. **Protective Coating Application:**\n   - Activities: \"Apply protective coating\", \"Dry coating\".\n   - Rationale: These steps involve applying a protective coating to the part and then drying it. This seems to be a post-assembly, finishing step.\n\n5. **Final Inspection:**\n   - Activities: \"Visual check\".\n   - Rationale: A final visual check is performed after the protective coating has been applied and dried. This seems like a final quality assurance step."

It could make sense to keep the \"Measure weld integrity\" part of the \"Welding\" step because it is a part of ensuring that the welding process was successful.\n\n3. **Coating and Drying:**\n   - Activities: \"Apply protective coating\", \"Dry coating\".\n   - Rationale: Same as before.\n\n4. **Final Inspection:**\n   - Activities: \"Visual check\".\n   - Rationale: Same as before."
