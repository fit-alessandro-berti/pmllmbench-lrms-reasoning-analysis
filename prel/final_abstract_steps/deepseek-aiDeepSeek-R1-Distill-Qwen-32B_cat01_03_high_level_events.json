    "Text": "Okay, I need to help the user by grouping the low-level events from the manufacturing process into higher-level steps. The user provided a sample event log, so Ill start by analyzing that. First, Ill look at the events for Case A1 and B2. Both cases have similar sequences, so I can infer a general pattern. Lets list out the activities for A1: 1. Retrieve raw metal sheet 2. Scan barcode 3. Place metal sheet on table 4. Align metal sheet 5. Preheat metal sheet 6. Pick up welding tool 7. Weld corner A 8. Weld corner B 9. Measure weld integrity 10. Apply protective coating 11. Dry coating 12. Visual check"

    "Text": "Looking at these, I notice that the first five activities are all about getting the metal sheet readyâ€”retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating. These seem to form a coherent step, so Ill call this Material Preparation."

    "Text": "Next, the user picks up a tool and starts welding. These actions are part of assembling the product, so this would be the Assembly step. Its important to note that the same operator (B) is doing both picking up the tool and welding, which suggests these are part of the same process."

    "Text": "After welding, the integrity is measured. This is a quality check, so this is the Quality Inspection step. Its a critical point because it ensures the welding is done correctly."

    "Text": "Then, the protective coating is applied and dried. These actions are about finishing the product, so they form the Finishing step. Using the coating unit and heating unit indicates that these are distinct but related actions within finishing."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Finally, theres a visual check, which is another quality assurance step. This step is separate from the weld integrity check because its a different type of inspection, likely done by a different operator (C), so Ill name this Final Quality Assurance."

    "Text": "I should consider the resources involved. For example, operators A, B, and C are involved in different steps, which helps in grouping. Also, the timestamps are close for each group, indicating they happen sequentially without significant breaks, supporting the grouping into higher-level steps. I need to ensure each high-level step is meaningful and covers all related low-level activities. By grouping them this way, it becomes easier to understand the overall manufacturing process without getting bogged down in details."
