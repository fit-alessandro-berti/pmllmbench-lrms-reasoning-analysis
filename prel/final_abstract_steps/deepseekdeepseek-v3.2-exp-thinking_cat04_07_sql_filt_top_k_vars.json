So we need to get the case_ids that have the top K variants. But note: the top K variants are defined by the variant string and then we take the top K by frequency. But note: multiple case_ids can have the same variant. So we can do: - First, compute the variant for each case. - Then, compute the frequency of each variant and rank them (or use a window function) to get the top K. - Then, we can get the case_ids that have a variant that is in the top K. Alternatively, we can do: Step 1: Assign a variant string to each case. Step 2: Count the cases per variant and assign a rank (or use a limit) to get the top K variants. Step 3: Then, we can join back to the original event_log on case_id, but only for cases that have a variant in the top K. Let's write the query accordingly. We'll use: WITH case_variants AS ( SELECT case_id, string_agg(activity, ' -> ' ORDER BY timestamp) AS variant FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ), variant_counts AS ( SELECT variant, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM case_variants GROUP BY variant ORDER BY frequency DESC LIMIT 3  -- top 3 variants ) SELECT el.* FROM event_log el WHERE el.case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM case_variants cv WHERE cv.variant IN (SELECT variant FROM variant_counts) ) ORDER BY el.case_id, el.timestamp;"

Let me test the logic: - We are aggregating the activities in the order of timestamp, so the string will represent the sequence. But note: what if two activities have the same timestamp? The problem says ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp. So if two activities have the same timestamp, then the order is non-deterministic? But the problem doesn't specify. We assume that the timestamp is unique per case?

But the problem says process variant is the ordered sequence, so we can use string_agg to form a string that represents the sequence. But note: if two different sequences form the same string? For example, if we have activities 'A' and 'B' and then again 'A' and 'B', then the string would be 'A -> B -> A -> B'. This is safe. Let's write the query accordingly. However, note: the problem does not specify the delimiter. We use ' -> ' but it can be any delimiter that does not appear in the activity names. If activity names can contain ' -> ', then we might have issues. But the problem does not specify, so we assume it's safe. Alternatively, we can use array_agg and then use the array for grouping. But then we cannot use IN with an array of arrays? We can use a hash of the array? Or we can convert the array to a string? Let's stick with string_agg because it's simpler. But note: the problem does not require the variant to be a string, but we need to group by the variant. So we can use either. Let me adjust: if we use array_agg, then we can group by the array. But then we cannot use the array in the IN clause? Actually, in DuckDB, we can. But let's check the documentation? Alternatively, we can use the string representation. Since the problem does not specify, let's use string_agg. However, note: the problem says complete activity sequence, so the string representation is acceptable. Let's run with the above query."

We are simply taking the top 3 by frequency, and if there are multiple variants with the same frequency, we are taking the first 3 we get when ordering by frequency descending. This might be non-deterministic if there are ties. The problem doesn't specify, so we assume that it's acceptable. Alternatively, we can use a window function to get all variants that are in the top K by frequency, even if there are ties? But the problem says top K variants, so if we have ties for the K-th place, we might get more than K. The problem doesn't specify. Let's assume we want exactly the top K, and if there are ties we break arbitrarily. We can use: WITH ...,variant_ranks AS ( SELECT variant, frequency, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rank FROM variant_counts )... But then we can filter by rank <= K. However, the problem does not specify the behavior in case of ties. We are going to use the simple LIMIT approach, which may arbitrarily break ties.

However, note: the problem does not require the output to be ordered, but it's typical to order by case and timestamp for readability. Let me check: the problem says Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. We are returning the events in the order of the original log? Not necessarily, we are ordering by case_id and timestamp. But the original log might have been in any order. The problem doesn't specify the order, so we can choose. We choose to order by case and then timestamp. Alternatively, we can remove the ORDER BY if the problem does not require a specific order.
