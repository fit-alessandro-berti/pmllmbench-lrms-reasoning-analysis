That's a contradiction because according to intended flow, every claim that's evaluated should be closed eventually.

    "Text": "Another point: If the noncoexistence is in place, then if E is present, C can't be. So how can a claim have both E and C? It can't, but existence of C is mandatory. Hence, the model is impossible unless all claims skip E, which would violate the responded existence if they have E."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - NE",
