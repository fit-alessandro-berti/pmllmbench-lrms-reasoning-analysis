But that's a problem because in the ideal flow, after Evaluate, the process proceeds to Approve, Notify, then Close. So E and C should both be present. The noncoexistence here would prevent a claim that has been evaluated from ever being closed. That's a contradiction because according to intended flow, every claim that's evaluated should be closed eventually. So this is conflicting with the \"existence\" of C which requires every trace to have C. So if a claim has E, then the noncoexistence would mean it can't have C, but existence requires C to be there. So that's a contradiction. So any trace that has E would violate the noncoexistence with C, but existence requires C. Therefore, this is a problem."

    "Text": "So the main anomaly is that the noncoexistence of E and C, but the existence constraint requires C. So they can't coexist, but C must exist.

Hence, the model is contradictory."

    "Text": "Another point: the precedence for C requires R to have happened, which is okay. The responded existence for E requiring A is okay because after Assign (A) comes Evaluate (E). But if the noncoexistence is in place, then if E is present, C can't be. So how can a claim have both E and C? It can't, but existence of C is mandatory. So any claim that has E would be invalid, which can't be because existence of C is mandatory. Hence, the model is impossible unless all claims skip E, which would violate the responded existence if they have E. Wait, the responded existence is on E: if E occurs, then A must occur. But E is not required. So if a claim doesn't have E, then there's no problem. But the noncoexistence would mean that C can only exist if E doesn't. So claims can either have E (but then can't have C, which is impossible due to existence) or not have E (and thus have C). But existence of C is required, so all claims must close. So if a claim skips E, then C is allowed. That violates the intended flow, which requires E to happen. So the model allows claims to be closed without evaluation, which is against the intended process. So the contradiction here is that the model requires C (existence), but if a claim follows E, it can't have C (noncoexistence). So the model enforces that any claim with E is invalid, which is impossible because existence of C is enforced. Therefore, the only valid traces are those without E and with C. So the model effectively allows skipping E, which is bad."
