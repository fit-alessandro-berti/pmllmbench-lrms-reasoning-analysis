Actually wait, loan decision happened at 11:00 and inform applicant happened at 13:00. That's only two hours after decision so it's fine.

That violates the desiderata timing of credit check (should be done within 24 hours after application received) - but that's only a recommended guideline and not required by normative rules? Wait, need to check: Normative rule: Credit Check must occur before risk assessment is a strict rule. And sequence says Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment. For case 3, credit check occurs on Jan 14 at 10:00 and then risk assessment is done on Jan 14 at 11:00. So they are still in the right order; normative rule is followed."

Actually, wait let's check: Inform Applicant should ideally be within 48 hours of loan decision but the strict rule says it must occur after loan decision and before case closure. And indeed inform applicant did occur at 2024-01-16 15:00. But note that in the desiderata conditions, it is preferred that the applicant is informed promptly (e.g., within 48 hours of the loan decision). For case 3, Loan Decision was on Jan 14 at 12:00; Inform Applicant occurred on Jan 16 at 15:00 which is exactly two days later plus maybe three hours. But recommended is within 48 hours, so this is a desideratum violation (suboptimal but not severe)."

The event log says it is a desideratum violation because credit check was done at 10:00 on Jan 14 which is more than 24 hours after application received. So that's also suboptimal (desideratum violation)."

    "Text": "Now summarizing: Case 1: Normative rules followed correctly, no normative violations. Desiderata conditions are satisfied except follow-up call missing but it's recommended optional behavior so not a problem. Case 2: Violates normative rules by having Risk Assessment occur before Credit Check and by finalizing documentation after loan decision that was rejected (since for rejection, you should not finalize documentation). So both violations. Case 3: Normative rules: The sequence is correct in terms of strict ordering (Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision, Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case) but the desiderata are not met because: - Credit check happened more than 24 hours after application was received. It's recommended to be done within 24 hours. - Inform applicant occurred later than the recommended time window (48 hours post decision). - Also no follow-up call was performed."

That is only 30 minutes later which meets recommended guidelines (within 48 hours).

Desiderata wise, case 2 doesn't have any issues regarding timing recommendations except maybe the credit check itself being done at a time that might not be recommended? ... Case 3: Normatively correct sequence. Desiderata violations: - Credit Check was done at Jan 14 10:00 while application received on Jan 12 09:00. That's more than 24 hours later... - Inform applicant occurred at Jan 16 15:00 which is beyond the recommended 48 hours after loan decision... - Also no follow-up call occurred."

    "Text": "Step 3: When possible, suggest interpretations or justifications for observed behaviors: - For Case 1, everything is in line with both normative and recommended practices, so there's nothing to justify. - For Case 2, the order violation (Risk Assessment before Credit Check) might be due to a process oversight or miscommunication. The finalization of documentation after rejection could be an administrative error where documentation was processed despite the rejection decision, possibly for internal record keeping or as part of process auditing requirements that were not updated in the rules. - For Case 3, although sequence is maintained, the delay in performing credit check and inform applicant may be due to external factors (e.g., resource constraints, delays from third-party credit bureaus, etc.) or misalignment between recommended guidelines and actual operational capacity. The absence of a follow-up call might indicate a lack of communication channels integration in that case."
