The process steps are pretty standard: submit, evaluate, request docs, approve, pay, close. The duration for each case would be the time from the first event (Submit Claim) to the last event (Close Claim). So I should calculate the duration for each case and then see which ones are in the upper percentiles, maybe the longest ones."
