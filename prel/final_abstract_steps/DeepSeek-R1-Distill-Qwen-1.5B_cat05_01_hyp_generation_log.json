Validate Stock (WarehouseClerk_2): Again, a standard validation step, looks good. 4. Confirm Shipment (LogisticsMgr_3): Logistics should confirm shipment, appears fine. 5. Ship Goods (LogisticsMgr_3): This is a confirmation of the next step in the process, seems okay. 6. Issue Invoice (FinanceTeam_01): This is the final step after receiving payment, which is logical. 7.
