    "Text": "Now, lets think about the differences between standard and custom paths: For standard requests, the process involves validation and parallel checks credit and inventory. For custom requests, feasibility is analyzed first. If feasible, a quotation is prepared; if not, a rejection notice is sent. Approval steps: Approval is needed based on some conditions not specified in the diagram. If approval is not granted, the process loops back to re-evaluate conditions, which could mean going back to the quotation step for custom requests or recalculating the delivery date for standard requests. Convergence points: After the parallel checks in the standard path, the process converges before calculating the delivery date. Both standard and custom paths converge at the approval check gateway. Looping back: If approval is not granted, the process loops back to earlier tasks depending on the path custom or standard."
