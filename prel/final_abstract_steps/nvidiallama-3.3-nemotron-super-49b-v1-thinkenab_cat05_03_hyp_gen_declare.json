    "Text": "Looking at the DECLARE model 1 Init Starts with R Receive Claim That makes sense as the first step 2 Existence C Close Claim must exist So every claim must be closed eventually 3 Responded Existence E Evaluate must exist if A Assign happens So after assigning there must be an evaluation 4 Precedence C must come after R Well since R is the first step this just ensures Close is after Receive which is already implied if the process is linear 5 Noncoexistence E cannot coexist with C Wait this means that if theres a Close C there shouldnt be an Evaluate E That doesnt make sense because normally Evaluate should happen before Close This seems contradictory"
