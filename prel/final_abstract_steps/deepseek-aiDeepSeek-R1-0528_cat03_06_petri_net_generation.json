Create transitions for each activity: C: Insurance Claim (but note: the customer files the claim, so we might model it as an initial transition? However, the problem says the initial marking is a token in a start place representing a new claim arriving. So we dont need a transition for Insurance Claim as an activity? The process starts after the claim is filed. The activities start with Claim Registration (CR). So well have a start place and then CR as the first transition."

Otherwise, we go to FC. - After FC, if doubts are raised, we go to II and then back to FC. Otherwise, we go to CA. - After CA, if the amount surpasses a threshold, we go to AP, then to P. Otherwise, we go directly to P? Actually, the problem says: The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So we can model: after CA, we have a decision: either go to AP (if above threshold) or skip AP and go to P. We can model this with two transitions: one for the case requiring approval and one for the case not requiring. However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for skipping approval. We can have: - After CA, we have a place, then a transition for AP (if needed) and also a direct transition to P (if not needed). Alternatively, we can have a silent transition for skipping approval? But the problem says to label transitions with activity names. Let me re-read: Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So AP is only done when necessary. We can model: CA -> place -> AP -> place -> P and also CA -> place -> (a silent transition? but the problem says to use activity names) ... but skipping approval is not an activity. However, note: the problem says Provide the Python code for constructing the Petri net ... define both the initial marking and final marking. We are free to model the control flow. We can do: After CA, we have a place (say p_after_CA). Then we have two transitions: - One labeled Approval (AP) that goes to a place (say p_after_AP) and then to P. - One labeled Skip Approval (but the problem doesnt name that) ... or we can use a silent transition? But the problem says: transitions labeled with the activity names. The activities are only the ones listed. Alternatively, we can have a transition for AP and then a transition that represents the automatic continuation without approval? However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for skipping. Another idea: we can have a silent transition (with label None) for the skip. This is acceptable in Petri nets. Similarly, for the loops: we have RDS and II as activities, but the loop back is not an activity? We can use arcs."

    "Text": "6. Well model: - The initial place: start_place (with token in initial marking) - Then transition CR (from start_place to a place after CR) - Then DV (from after_CR to after_DV) - Then from after_DV, we have two possibilities: - If documents are incomplete: RDS (which goes to a place, then back to DV) -> so we need a place between DV and RDS? Actually, we can have: after_DV -> RDS -> a place -> and then an arc from that place to DV? But note: DV is the transition we just came from. Alternatively, we can have: place_after_DV has an arc to RDS, and RDS goes to a place that is the same as the input place for DV? But note: the input place for DV is the place after CR. We dont want to go back to CR. Let me define places: p0: start (initial marking: token here) p1: after CR (so CR: p0 -> p1) p2: after DV (so DV: p1 -> p2) ... but wait, what if we need to go back? Then we need to have an arc from RDS to p1? However, note: after DV, if documents are incomplete, we do RDS and then we go back to DV. So we need to have a place that is the input to DV? But DV requires a token in p1. So we can have: DV: p1 -> p2 Then from p2, we have two transitions: - one silent transition (or labeled?) for documents complete -> then go to FC - one transition RDS: p2 -> p3 (a place) and then an arc from p3 back to p1? Then DV can be fired again. Similarly for FC and II."

Actually, RDS should lead to the same state as after CR? But note: after CR we have p_after_CR which is the input to DV. So if we want to re-do DV, we need to put a token in p_after_CR. Alternatively, we can have: CR: start -> p_after_CR DV: p_after_CR -> p_after_DV Then from p_after_DV: - if documents are complete: FC (p_after_DV -> p_after_FC_input) ... but wait, we havent defined FC yet. Let me reorganize: Well have: start_place -> CR -> p1 p1 -> DV -> p2 Then from p2, we have: - a transition documents_complete (silent) -> p3 (which is the input to FC) - a transition RDS -> p4 (and then from p4 we go back to p1) Similarly for FC: p3 -> FC -> p5 Then from p5: - a transition fraud_check_ok (silent) -> p6 (input to CA) - a transition II -> p7 (and then from p7 back to p3) Then CA: p6 -> p8 Then from p8: - if above threshold: AP -> p9 -> P -> p10 - else: silent_skip_AP -> p10 Then P: (if skipped, then from p10 we go to P? No, because P is the payment activity. Actually, note: the problem says The approved claim is paid out, meaning that if skipped we still have to pay? So we need to have P after the skip? Actually, the problem says: Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. Then Payment (P): The approved claim is paid out So if the claim is not approved (because it didnt require approval) then we still pay? Therefore, we can model: After CA, we have a place (p8). Then: - If above threshold: AP (from p8 to p9) and then P (from p9 to p10) - Else: silent_skip (from p8 to p10) and then P? But wait, the payment activity P must be executed in both cases. Alternatively, we can have: After CA, we have a place p8. Then we have a transition P that can be fired only if we have a token in p8? But then how do we model the approval? Actually, we need to have: The payment activity P requires either: - a token from AP (if approved) OR - a token from the silent skip (if not approved) So we can have: AP: p8 -> p9, and then an arc from p9 to p11? silent_skip: p8 -> p10, and then an arc from p10 to p11? Then P: p11 -> p12 But note: the problem says Payment (P): The approved claim is paid out - but even if not approved? Actually, the problem says The approved claim meaning that if it didnt require approval, then its not an approved claim? However, the payment step is always done. So we can interpret: the payment step is always done, and it is called Payment. So we can have: P: from the merge place (p11) to p12. Then p12 -> N -> p13 -> CL -> end_place."
