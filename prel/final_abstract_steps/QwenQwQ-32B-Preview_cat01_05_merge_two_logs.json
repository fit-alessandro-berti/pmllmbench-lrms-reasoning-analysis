    "Text": "First, I need to understand the structure and content of both logs. Log A is from System A and is considered the primary timeline, but its timestamps might reflect when events were received, not when they started. It has fewer attributes per event, like event type, order ID, and basic timestamps. Log B is from System B and has richer attributes, including user ID, resource ID, and additional metadata. Its timestamps might be slightly offset from those in Log A by a few seconds or milliseconds, and some event names differ between the two logs. Also, one log might have events that the other doesn't have."

If two events from different logs seem to represent the same occurrence, I should merge them into a single record, including all their attributes. If I can't confidently match two events, I should leave them separate but include them in the final log with an indication of their origin."

Since my timestamp tolerance is less than 2 seconds, these two events are close enough to be considered the same event. So, I'll merge them into one record, combining their attributes."

    "Text": "Log A has 'Payment Processed' at 10:02:00Z. Log B has 'PaymentCheck' at 10:02:05Z, which is 5 seconds later. Hmm, my tolerance is less than 2 seconds, so this doesn't fit within that window. However, the events seem related in purpose—both deal with payment. Maybe there's a delay between when System A records the payment as processed and when System B checks it. Given that, I might consider relaxing the timestamp tolerance a bit for this specific case, say up to 10 seconds, because payment processing can involve some delay due to external gateways."

So, it's important to include this in the merged log."
