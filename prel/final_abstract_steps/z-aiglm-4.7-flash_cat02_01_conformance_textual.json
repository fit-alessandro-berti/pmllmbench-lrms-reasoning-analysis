Step 1 (Conditional): Check inventory must occur before any decisions about payment or fulfillment. Branch A (Inventory Sufficient): After Check Inventory: 1. Authorize payment. 2. Package items. 3. Ship order. 4. Close order (Final step). Branch B (Inventory Insufficient): After Check Inventory: 1. Cancel order. 2. Close order. Key Constraints Rule Summary: 1. Receive Check Inventory (Authorize Payment OR Cancel) Package Ship Close. 2. Sequence Specifics: Authorization must be after Check inventory and before Package. Package must be after Authorization and before Ship. Ship must be after Package and never after Cancel. Close must be the final activity."

No violations. Case 2: Receive order Check inventory Package items Authorize payment Ship order Close order. Analysis: Violation: Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before packaging. Package items occurs before Authorize payment. Case 3: Receive order Check inventory Authorize payment Cancel order Ship order Close order. Analysis: Violation: Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation. Ship order occurs after Cancel order. Case 4: Receive order Check inventory Cancel order Close order. Analysis: Matches Insufficient Inventory flow perfectly. No violations. Case 5: Receive order Check inventory Authorize payment Ship order Close order. Analysis: Missing Package items. Package items must occur before Ship order."

Violation 2: Case 3. Rule: Ship order never after a cancellation. Log: Cancel order Ship order. Violation 3: Case 5. Rule: Package items before shipping. Log: Authorize payment Ship order."

    "Text": "5. Drafting the Response: Self-Correction during drafting: For Case 2 the text says Authorize payment before packaging. The log has Package then Authorize. Thats a violation. Self-Correction for Case 3: The strongest rule violation is Ship order never after a cancellation."

    "Text": "6. Final Polish: Lets double check Case 5. Log: Receive Check Authorize Ship Close. Normative: Receive Check Authorize Package Ship Close. The Package Items step is missing. This violates the sequencing rule. Lets double check Case 3 again. Ship order after Cancel order. Clear violation. Lets double check Case 2 again. Package before Authorize. Clear violation. So Cases 2 3 and 5 are violations. Cases 1 and 4 are compliant."
