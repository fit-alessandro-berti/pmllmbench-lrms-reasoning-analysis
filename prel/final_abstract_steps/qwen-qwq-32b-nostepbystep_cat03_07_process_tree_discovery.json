Wait, according to the problem description: The * operator (loop) is such that A is executed, then either you exit the loop, or you execute B and then A again. Wait, the operator is * (A,B). So the loop is structured as: first execute A, then either exit or do B then A again. Wait no, the description says: the loop is structured so that A is executed, then either exit, or you execute B and then A again. Wait, maybe the loop operator takes two children: the first is the body (A), and the second is the condition (B)? Or maybe the operator's children are first the loop body, then the condition?

Because in Case 2, there's no RMI or VF after AE, so the loop must be optional. Hmm, so the loop must be optional. So the loop itself must be placed in an optional branch. ... Wait, the loop's definition says that you execute A first, then choose to exit or loop. So the minimal execution is A once. But in Case 2, there's no RMI or VF after AE, so that would require that the loop can be exited before doing A at all. Hmm, that's a problem. So perhaps the loop isn't the right operator here because the loop requires at least one execution of A. ... Wait, perhaps the correct approach is to have an optional choice (XOR between doing the loop and doing nothing (tau). ... Ah, right! So to allow zero or more iterations of the loop, perhaps the loop is placed in an XOR choice with a tau. ... Thus, the structure after AE would be: XOR ( loop ( A, B ), tau ), where A is the sequence RMI followed by VF, and B is a tau. ... Thus, the structure after AE is an XOR between the loop (which requires at least one occurrence) and a tau (doing nothing, so zero occurrences."
