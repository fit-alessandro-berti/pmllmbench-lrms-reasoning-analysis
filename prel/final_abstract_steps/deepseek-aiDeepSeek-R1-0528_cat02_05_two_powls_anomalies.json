This may allow repeating Onboard arbitrarily, which might be acceptable. - xor_payroll: an XOR between Payroll and skip. So either we do Payroll or we skip it.

The only anomaly is that Interview and Decide are unordered, which allows an incorrect order (Decide before Interview). However, in practice, the process might still run correctly if the participants follow the intended order? Or if there is a data dependency (you cannot decide without interview results) but the model doesnt enforce it. - Model2, on the other hand, has multiple severe anomalies: Screening is not required to be done before Interview (and can even be done after closing), and it allows skipping payroll. These are fundamental violations of the process logic. Therefore, we choose Model1."
