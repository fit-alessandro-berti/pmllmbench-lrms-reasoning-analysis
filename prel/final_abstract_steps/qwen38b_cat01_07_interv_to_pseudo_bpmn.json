If yes, log into the system, then send to Purchasing. Then match invoice with PO. If discrepancies, escalate to Purchasing or supervisor. Then manager approval, then payment scheduling.

If yes, send to manager for approval. If discrepancies, escalate to supervisor. Then manager approval. After approval, schedule payment."

Or during the Purchasing verification step, if PO is missing, Karen is involved. But the transcripts mention that Karen is involved when AP or Purchasing finds issues. So perhaps during the initial steps, if there's a missing PO, AP sends to supplier, but Karen is involved if the supplier is unable to provide the PO. Wait, Mary says if no PO, she sends back to supplier requesting more details. Karen's role is if the invoice is missing PO, she asks supplier for it. So maybe that's part of the initial step. But the initial step is Mary's responsibility. So perhaps the initial step is Check PO. If no PO, send to supplier. But if the supplier can't provide, maybe Karen is involved.
