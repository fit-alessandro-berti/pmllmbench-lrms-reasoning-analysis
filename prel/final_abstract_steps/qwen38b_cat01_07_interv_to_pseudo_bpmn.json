    "Text": "Starting with Marys interview. She describes the process from receiving an invoice. First, check for a PO. If no PO, send back to supplier. If yes, log into the system, then send to Purchasing. Then match invoice with PO. If discrepancies, escalate to Purchasing or supervisor. Then manager approval, then payment scheduling. So the main flow is: Receive Invoice Check PO Log Send to Purchasing Match PO Approval Payment."

Then send to Purchasing. Purchasing checks PO details. If discrepancies, contact supplier or hold. Then confirm to AP. Then, another gateway: does the invoice match PO? If yes, send to manager for approval. If discrepancies, escalate to supervisor. Then manager approval. After approval, schedule payment."

    "Text": "Wait, Mary says after confirming receipt and matching, send to manager. Dan says once Purchasing confirms, send to manager. So maybe after Purchasing confirms, the next step is manager approval. But Rita mentions that if there are exceptions, like no PO, she handles it. Also, Karens role is when theres a missing PO or pricing issues, which might be part of the initial checks or during matching."

Need to structure all these steps into a BPMN-like textual model, ensuring that all the mentioned steps are included, roles are assigned, gateways are properly placed, and exceptions are noted. Also, the user wants the output to be a textual representation that can be converted into a BPMN diagram without ambiguity. Ill need to list each activity, sequence flow, gateway, roles, and artifacts. Also, note any exceptions or variations. For example, Ritas role in handling exceptions and Karens role in supplier communication."
