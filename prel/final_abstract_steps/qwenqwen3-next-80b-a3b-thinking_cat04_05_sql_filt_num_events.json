Hmm, right. The table has case_id, activity, timestamp. Each row is an event. So for each case_id, we need to count how many rows there are. Then, only keep the cases where the count is <=6."

Maybe using a subquery or a CTE. Lets think. One way is to first create a subquery that gets the case_ids with count <=6. Then join that with the original table to get all the events for those case_ids."

Then HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 would select only those groups where the count is <=6. So the subquery returns case_ids that meet that condition. Yes. Alternatively, if we did WHERE COUNT(*) <=6, but thats not allowed because WHERE is before grouping. So HAVING is correct here."

Yes. So the query should work. Alternatively, using a JOIN with a derived table. But the IN clause is fine. So the final answer would be the query using IN with a subquery that groups by case_id and has HAVING COUNT(*) <=6. Yes. So the correct SQL is: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ); Alternatively, using COUNT(1) instead of COUNT(*), but they are equivalent. So this should be the correct query."
