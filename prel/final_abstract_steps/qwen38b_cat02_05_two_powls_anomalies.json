The typical steps are: Post a job ad, screen candidates, conduct interviews, make a hiring decision, onboard the employee, add them to payroll, and then close the case. Theres also the possibility of some steps being repeated or having choices, like maybe multiple interviews or different onboarding steps, but the core sequence should follow a logical order."

But in a standard process, after screening, you might have interviews, then decide. So maybe the Screen activity is followed by Interview, and then Decide. However, in model1, Screen is connected to both Decide and Interview. That could be a problem. Because in reality, you screen candidates, then interview them, and then decide. So Screen should come before Interview, which comes before Decide. But here, Screen is connected to both Decide and Interview. That might imply that Decide can happen before Interview, which is not logical. Because you cant make a hiring decision before interviewing candidates. So thats an anomaly."

    "Text": "So, the loop_onboarding is a loop operator. The loop is between Onboard and skip. Wait, the loop operator is defined as * (A, B), which means execute A, then either exit the loop or execute B followed by A again. So loop_onboarding is a loop that includes Onboard and skip. So after Decide, you go to loop_onboarding. Then loop_onboarding is connected to xor_payroll. So the loop_onboarding would allow for repeating Onboard (maybe multiple onboarding steps?) but with a skip. Wait, but how does the loop work? Lets think: the loop operator is between two sub-models. So the structure is * (A, B). So you first execute A (Onboard), then you can either exit the loop or execute B (skip) and then go back to A again. Wait, thats a bit confusing. Maybe the loop allows for repeating the Onboard activity, but with a possibility to skip? Not sure. But the presence of a loop might be an anomaly. Because in the standard process, onboarding is a one-time activity. So looping onboarding would imply that you might have to onboard multiple times, which is not typical. Unless maybe theres a case where an employee is rehired, but thats not standard. So thats a possible anomaly."

    "Text": "Then, the xor_payroll is an exclusive choice between Payroll and skip. So after loop_onboarding, you have a choice: either do Payroll or skip it. But in the standard process, Payroll is a necessary step after onboarding. So skipping Payroll would be an anomaly. Because adding to payroll is essential. So model2 allows skipping Payroll, which is a problem. Also, the edges from Post to Screen and Post to Interview. So Post is connected to both Screen and Interview. That suggests that after posting the job, you can do Screen or Interview. But in reality, you post the job, then screen candidates, then interview, so Screen should come before Interview. So having Post connected to both Screen and Interview directly would imply that Interview can happen before Screen, which is not correct. So thats another anomaly."

Thats a major problem because you cant decide to hire someone without interviewing them. So thats a severe anomaly. Model2 has the problem of allowing Interview before Screen (since Post is connected to both Screen and Interview), which is also a problem. Also, the loop and skip in Payroll are less severe but still anomalies. So, which model is better? Well, model1 has a more linear structure, but with a mistake in the order of Decide and Interview. Model2 has some branching and loops that are not standard."

So Screen is followed by Decide and Interview. That would mean that after screening, you can either decide (without interviews?) or proceed to interviews. Thats not standard. Typically, interviews come before the hiring decision. So model1 has an anomaly where Decide is allowed to happen before Interview, which is a problem."

    "Text": "So both models have anomalies, but which is worse? Model1s anomaly is that Decide can happen before Interview, which is a critical error in the hiring process. Because without interviews, you cant make a decision. Model2s anomalies are allowing Interview before Screen (which is also wrong) and allowing skipping Payroll (which is critical). So both models have critical anomalies. However, model2 has a loop onboarding which is a less critical anomaly but still problematic. Comparing the two, which model is more normative? Model1s structure is more linear, but with a mistake in the order of Decide and Interview. Model2 has more complex operators (loop and XOR) which introduce anomalies. But perhaps model1 is closer to the norm, except for the Decide before Interview."
