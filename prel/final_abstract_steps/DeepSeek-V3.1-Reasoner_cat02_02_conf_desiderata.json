Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform at 13:00, which is 2 hours later, so within 48 hours good for desideratum) - Finalize Documentation ...

    "Text": "Finally, suggest interpretations or justifications for observed behaviors. For Case 2, the behavior might be due to an error in process execution, perhaps a human mistake or system glitch where Risk Assessment was done prematurely without Credit Check, and then they did Credit Check later. Also, after rejection, they mistakenly finalized documentation, which should not happen. And they forgot to inform the applicant, which is a serious omission. For Case 3, the delays might be due to workload, weekends, or other reasons, but since they are only desiderata violations, it's not critical, but suboptimal."
