Cases 102 and 104 are somewhat above average but not as extreme as Case 105."

    "Text": "But lets think about what significantly longer means. If we consider the average is about 20 hours, then cases that take more than, say, 24 hours might be considered significantly longer. So Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above 24 hours. But Case 105 is way higher than the others. But to be precise, lets calculate the standard deviation to see whats truly an outlier. First, lets list the times in hours... Average is 20.12 hours. Now, calculate the squared differences from the mean... Variance 299.21 Standard deviation 17.3 hours Now, a common rule is that values more than 1 standard deviation above the mean are considered above average, and more than 2 standard deviations are outliers. Mean + 1 SD 20.12 + 17.3 37.42 hours Mean + 2 SD 54.72 hours Case 105 is at 48.08 hours, which is between 1 and 2 SD above the mean. Cases 102 and 104 are below 1 SD above the mean."

    "Text": "But lets look at all cases above average... Looking at Case 105... So the big delays are 1. From escalation to next investigation 28 hours 2. From second investigation to resolution 19 hours Case 102... So the big delay is from investigation to resolution 19 hours. Case 104... Here, the delay is from investigation to resolution about 19 hours. Case 101 fast case... Case 103 another fast case... From this, we can see that cases with escalations Cases 102, 105 tend to take longer. Also, in Cases 102, 104, and 105, theres a significant delay between the investigation step and the resolution step."

    "Text": "In Case 105, theres an additional escalation step that seems to cause a long delay. In Case 102 Level2 started investigating 2.5 hours after escalation, but in Case 105, it took 28 hours. So perhaps the issue is that when tickets are escalated to Level2, sometimes theres a long delay before Level2 starts investigating. But why the difference Maybe Level2 availability or prioritization is an issue. Maybe Level2 agents are not always available, or escalated tickets arent being prioritized properly. Also, in all slow cases 102, 104, 105, the time from investigation to resolution is about 19 hours. Maybe thats just how long it takes to resolve certain types of issues, but in the fast cases 101, 103, its much quicker. So maybe the nature of the issue affects resolution time, but the escalation process can add additional delays."

    "Text": "From this, we can see that in the slow cases 102, 104, 105, the biggest delays are between investigation and resolution about 19 hours in all three. But in Case 105, theres an additional large delay between escalation and the next investigation 28 hours. In Case 102, the delay between escalation and investigation is only 2.5 hours... Case 101... Case 102... Case 103... Case 104... Case 105... So, one potential issue is that escalations to Level2 can sometimes take a long time before investigation begins as in Case 105. Another issue is that even without escalation, some investigations take a long time to resolve as in Cases 102 and 104."

    "Text": "Possible issues 1. Delays in starting investigation after assignment as in Case 104 3.5 hours. 2. Delays in Level2 picking up escalated tickets as in Case 105 28 hours vs. Case 102 2.5 hours. 3. Long investigation to resolution times in some cases, possibly due to issue complexity or waiting for external factors."

    "Text": "But to be precise, the question asks to identify which cases have significantly longer resolution times... Cases 102, 104, and 105 are above average. But significantly longer might mean more than, say, 24 hours... Wait, mean is 20.12, SD is 17.3, so mean + 1 SD is 37.42 hours. So cases above 37.42 hours would be more than 1 SD above mean. Only Case 105 is above that... But in practical terms, Cases 102 and 104 are also taking much longer than the fast cases... Alternatively, perhaps the average is skewed by the very long Case 105. If we exclude Case 105, the average of the other four cases is 13.23 hours. Then Case 105 is way above this, and Cases 102 and 104 are also above this new average."

    "Text": "So, the significantly longer cases are 102, 104, and 105, with 105 being the most extreme. The main factors causing delays are long investigation to resolution times, delays in escalation handling, and delays in starting investigations. Potential root causes 1. Some issues require more time to resolve hence the 19hour investigation to resolution time in slow cases. 2. Delays in the escalation process as seen in Case 105 where it took 28 hours for Level2 to start investigating after escalation. 3. Delays in starting investigation after assignment as in Case 104 where it took 3.5 hours from assignment to investigation. Recommendations 1. Analyze the types of issues that lead to long investigation times... 2. Improve the escalation process... 3. Monitor the time between assignment and investigation start... 4. Consider setting and monitoring SLAs..."
