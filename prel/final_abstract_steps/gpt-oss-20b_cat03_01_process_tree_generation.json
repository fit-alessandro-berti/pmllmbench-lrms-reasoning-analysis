The loop condition is abnormal results; but we model as loop with body and exit after normal results? We can model as * (body, tau?) Actually typical representation: * (body, exit). But here we want repeated until normal results; so we can use * (body, tau) where tau indicates exit when normal? Might be simpler: use * (body, tau). Body includes SC->XOR(TM,SPT)->RDT->XOR(FCE,FBA). After RDT if normal then exit else continue loop. So we can represent as * (SC->XOR(TM,SPT)->RDT->XOR(FCE,FBA), tau). That matches semantics: execute body; after each iteration decide whether to continue or exit via silent step."

We'll pass parent param when creating leaves except those that are internal nodes where we will set .parent later manually perhaps easier by passing during creation too if possible e.g., diag_choice created with no label but operator XOR and no explicit label, so its constructor may accept operator only; we can pass operator only and later set its .children etc without specifying parent. But better pass operator only since it's internal node; its default .label None ; fine. For internal nodes like seq loops etc also no labels needed except maybe for loops which have two arguments inside parentheses - they are represented by having two child subtrees inside the LOOP nodes children list [body,tau]. That's fine."

Also provide textual representation maybe using pm4py's print_tree function? But just provide construction code suffices per prompt likely expecting such snippet plus explanation of structure mapping operators to scenario steps. We'll output both explanation mapping each part and the full python script building the process tree object ready for further analysis like generating traces etc., referencing pm4py library functions like print_tree if needed for demonstration but not required per prompt though could include example usage printing trace sets via generate_traces function from pm4py.algo.discovery.inductive.util import generate_traces? But keep simple focusing on construction only due to complexity length constraints though still okay within answer length ~500-700 words including explanation lines comments inside code about mapping steps. Will ensure LaTeX formatting used for any math expressions though none needed here except maybe mention operators symbolically e.g., ->, X, +, *. We'll include small inline math examples describing operators mapping e.g., Sequence (->), Exclusive Choice (X), Parallel (+), Loop (*). Use LaTeX formatting accordingly per rules. Ok produce answer."
