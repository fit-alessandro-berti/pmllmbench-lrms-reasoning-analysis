    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Possible constraints to add Coexistence between each sensitive check activity and ManualReview So if CheckRace happens ManualReview must happen Precedence ManualReview must precede Reject and Approve Non succession between sensitive check activities and Reject or Approve but maybe only Reject is more critical But maybe for all decision activities like Reject and Approve ManualReview must precede Alternatively perhaps only for certain decisions But to be safe maybe all decisions So lets see First the activities we need to add are CheckApplicantRace CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantAge ManualReview But in the initial model these arent present So when adding constraints we need to reference them So for the coexistence constraint In the coexistence key add entries for CheckApplicantRace CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantAge each mapping to ManualReview Also for precedence for Reject activity add ManualReview as a predecessor So in precedence Reject ManualReview Same for Approve if there is such an activity But if theres no Reject activity but FinalDecision is the activity then perhaps we need to model it differently Hmm Perhaps in the example model the FinalDecision is a single activity But the problem says certain decisions eg Approve Reject RequestAdditionalInfo might be influenced by sensitive attributes Wait RequestAdditionalInfo is part of the model So perhaps the decision activities are Approve and Reject but they are not in the example model The example model has FinalDecision So perhaps FinalDecision is the activity that represents the final decision step either Approve or Reject But in terms of activities its just FinalDecision So perhaps the bias could be in how the FinalDecision is made but the model doesnt distinguish between Approve and Reject This complicates things Because if the FinalDecision activity is the same regardless of the outcome then the model cant directly enforce constraints based on the outcome But perhaps the problem assumes that there are separate activities for Approve and Reject Alternatively maybe the problem expects us to treat FinalDecision as the activity and perhaps the sensitive checks happen before that So to prevent bias we need to ensure that before the FinalDecision theres a ManualReview So for example if FinalDecision occurs then ManualReview must have occurred before So precedence FinalDecision ManualReview But also if CheckRace occurs then ManualReview must coexist So lets proceed with that Possible constraints to add 1 Coexistence between CheckApplicantRace and ManualReview Similarly for CheckApplicantGender and CheckApplicantAge 2 Precedence for FinalDecision requiring ManualReview Because if ManualReview must happen before any FinalDecision then that would ensure that before making a decision theres a manual check 3 Non succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision So that CheckRace cannot directly lead to FinalDecision without something in between But perhaps the precedence is sufficient Because if ManualReview must precede FinalDecision then CheckRace followed by FinalDecision would violate the precedence constraint only if ManualReview didnt happen But the precedence constraint ensures that ManualReview is present before FinalDecision But if CheckRace occurs and ManualReview occurs before FinalDecision thats okay Alternatively to prevent CheckRace from immediately leading to FinalDecision we could add a non succession constraint between CheckRace and FinalDecision So that CheckRace cannot be immediately followed by FinalDecision Which would require at least one activity in between like ManualReview But with the precedence constraint if ManualReview is required before FinalDecision then even if CheckRace is followed by ManualReview and then FinalDecision its okay So adding precedence for FinalDecision requiring ManualReview would handle that But also for the sensitive checks maybe we need to ensure that ManualReview happens whenever a sensitive check occurs So coexistence between CheckRace and ManualReview So if CheckRace is present then ManualReview must be present That way whenever someones race is checked theres a manual review But perhaps the manual review is only required for certain cases but this would enforce it for all So adding both coexistence and precedence might be redundant Because if ManualReview must precede FinalDecision then for the FinalDecision to occur ManualReview must be present But if CheckRace occurs and no ManualReview then the precedence constraint for FinalDecision would prevent FinalDecision from happening But perhaps in some cases FinalDecision could happen without ManualReview but the precedence constraint would prevent that So thats good But also maybe there are cases where CheckRace happens but FinalDecision doesnt happen eg the application is withdrawn But in that case the precedence constraint for FinalDecision wouldnt apply So the coexistence constraint would ensure that if CheckRace happens ManualReview happens So adding coexistence between CheckRace and ManualReview would ensure that whenever CheckRace is present ManualReview is present Which is good So lets proceed to add these So the new constraints would be In coexistence CheckApplicantRace CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantAge each coexist with ManualReview In precedence FinalDecision requires ManualReview to precede In nonsuccession CheckApplicantRace etc cannot directly precede FinalDecision But perhaps the precedence is sufficient But adding non succession would also help Another point the problem says ensure that the sequence of activities does not discriminate based on these attributes For example you might add constraints that enforce that any decision activities cannot immediately follow or be preceded only by events where a sensitive attribute leads to a biased outcome So for example if CheckRace occurs then the next activity shouldnt be Reject But in the model if theres a Reject activity then non succession between CheckRace and Reject But if the model has FinalDecision as the activity then maybe we should apply non succession between CheckRace and FinalDecision But perhaps the problem assumes that there are separate activities for Approve and Reject But given the example model has FinalDecision perhaps well treat it as the decision activity So adding In nonsuccession CheckApplicantRace to FinalDecision is not allowed Similarly for gender and age checks So the steps to update the model Original model has some constraints Lets see the initial model structure The initial model has existence StartApplication and FinalDecision init StartApplication coexistence StartApplication and FinalDecision response StartApplication to RequestAdditionalInfo succession RequestAdditionalInfo to FinalDecision Other keys are empty Now adding new constraints So the updated model would have In coexistence add CheckApplicantRace CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantAge each with ManualReview In precedence add FinalDecision with ManualReview In nonsuccession add CheckApplicantRace CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantAge each with FinalDecision Also perhaps other constraints For example if ManualReview must happen after CheckRace but before FinalDecision But the precedence and non succession would handle that Another possible constraint for the ManualReview to coexist with certain decisions But the coexistence between CheckRace and ManualReview would ensure that whenever CheckRace happens ManualReview is present So if CheckRace is present ManualReview must be present Which would cover the case where CheckRace is done but ManualReview isnt But if ManualReview is required before FinalDecision via precedence then even if ManualReview happens after CheckRace but before FinalDecision its okay So adding both coexistence and precedence and non succession Alternatively maybe the precedence is sufficient but adding non succession would add an extra layer Another possibility for the ManualReview to coexist with certain decisions Like if the FinalDecision is Reject then ManualReview must have occurred But again how to model that in DECLARE Because the FinalDecision activity is just FinalDecision but perhaps the actual decision type is part of the data but in the process model the activities might be different Wait maybe the process has activities like Approve and Reject instead of a single FinalDecision But in the given example the model has FinalDecision as an activity So perhaps FinalDecision is a single activity that represents the final decision step which can have different outcomes But in the model perhaps the activities are separate Approve Reject etc But the example model has FinalDecision as part of existence So maybe the example is simplified Lets assume that in reality there are activities for different decisions But perhaps the problem expects us to treat FinalDecision as the activity but also have activities like CheckRace etc But given that the problem says to add constraints to limit bias lets assume that the process has activities like CheckApplicantRace ManualReview etc So adding In coexistence CheckApplicantRace must coexist with ManualReview Similarly for CheckApplicantGender and CheckApplicantAge In precedence For Reject activity ManualReview must precede it But if theres no Reject activity but FinalDecision is the activity then perhaps we need to model it differently Hmm So perhaps in the example model the FinalDecision is a single activity But the problem says certain decisions eg Approve Reject RequestAdditionalInfo might be influenced by sensitive attributes So RequestAdditionalInfo is a possible decision step So perhaps the process has activities like Approve and Reject but they are not in the example model The example model has FinalDecision So perhaps FinalDecision is the activity that represents the final decision step either Approve or Reject But in terms of activities its just FinalDecision So perhaps the bias could be in the FinalDecision step regardless of the outcome But then how to model different outcomes Maybe the process model has separate activities like Approve and Reject But in the example the model has FinalDecision as an activity So perhaps the example is simplified and for the purpose of the problem we should assume that there are activities like Approve and Reject Alternatively maybe the problem expects us to add constraints that involve ManualReview before the FinalDecision But that would apply to all FinalDecisions regardless of outcome But maybe thats a good thing But the problem says certain decisions eg Approve Reject RequestAdditionalInfo might be influenced by sensitive attributes So perhaps the process has separate activities for Approve and Reject But given the example model has FinalDecision perhaps well treat it as the decision activity So adding In nonsuccession CheckApplicantRace to FinalDecision is not allowed Similarly for gender and age checks So the steps to update the model"
