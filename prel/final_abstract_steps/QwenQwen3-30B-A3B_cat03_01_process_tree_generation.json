    "Text": "Then, after the initial diagnostic test (CE or FBP), the results must be evaluated. If abnormal, a loop starts. The loop includes Specialist Consultation (SC), then an exclusive choice between TM and SPT, then RDT (which is an XOR between FCE and FBA), and then if results are still abnormal, loop back to SC. So this loop is a * operator."

    "Text": "This part is a bit tricky. Let me think again. The loop starts with SC, then TM/SPT, then RDT. After RDT, if the result is abnormal, the loop repeats. So the loop is a * operator where A is the sequence SC -> (TM/SPT) -> RDT, and B is the loop back to SC. But how to model the loop back. This is getting complicated. Maybe I should proceed step by step."

    "Text": "Next, after the loop ends (when results are normal), the patient proceeds to Advanced Imaging (AI) and Nutritional Counseling (NC) in true concurrency. So that's a + operator between AI and NC. Then, after AI and NC, the patient goes through a sequence of FAS and DDI. Finally, the patient goes through the concurrency block of BL, ICP, MRF in true concurrency. So that's a + operator between BL, ICP, MRF."

This seems to model the loop correctly, even though it's a bit simplified. Now, let's check if all the activities are included. Yes, all activities are included. The concurrency blocks are correctly modeled as PARALLEL operators. The sequence steps are modeled with SEQUENCE operators. The exclusive choices are modeled with XOR operators. The loop is modeled with the * operator. This should satisfy the requirements."
