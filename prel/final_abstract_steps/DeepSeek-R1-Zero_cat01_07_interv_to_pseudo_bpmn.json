    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "From the transcripts, it's clear that the process revolves around the Accounts Payable department's handling of invoices, involving validation, matching with purchase orders, and obtaining approvals from relevant stakeholders."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Key recurring elements include activities like invoice receipt, PO validation, line item matching, and approval routing, which appeared multiple times across interviews."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The logical sequence of events in the process model was created by piecing together overlapping descriptions from multiple interviews, e.g., Mary logging invoices into the system always precedes forwarding them to the purchasing department."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The model was cross-checked with interview data to ensure it accurately reflects the tasks, roles, and outcomes described, such as discrepancies leading to escalation or resolution loops."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "When processing discrepancies, tasks like 'Contact Supplier' or 'Escalate to Supervisor' clearly follow logically from an inability to resolve issues at the clerk or purchasing officer levels."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "A heuristic approach was applied to group related roles and tasks (e.g., resolving exceptions involving the AP Supervisor, Supplier Relationship Manager, or Purchasing Officer), acknowledging minor gaps in explicit role descriptions."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "The shared role dependencies across interviews were identified, such as Purchasing confirming received goods, Managers performing final approvals, and the Supplier Relationship Manager addressing pricing or term issues."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The inclusion of loops in the BPMN-like model was validated against narratives about handling incomplete or incorrect invoices (e.g., waiting for corrected supplier documents or solving internal discrepancies)."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Certain conditional pathways (e.g., bypassing confirmation if thereâ€™s no valid PO) were deduced logically, though not always explicitly stated verbatim in interviews."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Additional steps, such as creating retrospective POs for informally contracted services, were reasonably inferred to connect missing links when exceptions disrupted the process flow."
