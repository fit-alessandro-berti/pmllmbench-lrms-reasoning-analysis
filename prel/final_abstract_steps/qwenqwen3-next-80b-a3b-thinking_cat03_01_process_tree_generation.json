So perhaps the * (A, B) operator's children are A and B, and the semantics are: execute A, then either exit or execute B and then the entire * (A, B) again. Wait, that would make sense.

So for the loop, A could be the body (SC, treatment, RDT), and B could be the part that leads back to A. But what is B? ... The structure after A is X(tau, A). So the loop is * ( A, X(tau, A) ) Yes. Because: - Execute A. - Then, X(tau, A). So either exit (tau) or execute A again. Which matches the requirement: after A, if abnormal, loop again (i.e., execute A again). Yes.
