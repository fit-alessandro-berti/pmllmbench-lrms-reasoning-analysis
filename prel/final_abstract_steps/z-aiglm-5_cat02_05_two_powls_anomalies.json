Conduct Interviews: Interview selected candidates. 4. Make Hiring Decision: Decide who to hire or not hire. 5. Onboard Employee: If hired integrate them into the company. 6. Add to Payroll: Setup payment details. 7. Close Case: Finalize the process. Typical ConstraintsOrdering: Post Screen Interview Decide Onboard Payroll Close. Interviews usually happen after screening you dont interview everyone who applies only the screened ones. Decision happens after interviews. Onboarding happens after a positive decision. Payroll happens after onboarding."

There is no edge from Interview to anything else nor anything to Interview except Screen. Anomaly 1 Severe: Since there is no edge between Interview and Decide they can execute in parallel or in reverse order. You could make a hiring decision before conducting interviews. This is a major logical flaw. Anomaly 2 Severity: Also Screen Interview is there. Screen Decide is there. This allows Decide to happen before Interview. The standard process requires Interviews before the Decision. Missing Sequence Logic: Interview is somewhat disconnected or parallel to Decide. This violates the core information dependency you cannot make a data-driven hiring decision without the interview data."

The code lists PostScreen PostInterview InterviewDecide. There is NO edge Screen Interview. This means Screen and Interview are effectively parallel or ordered arbitrarily relative to each other only constrained by Post. Anomaly: You can conduct interviews without screening candidates first. This is inefficientunrealistic interviewing unqualified candidates but perhaps less severe than deciding without interviewing. Interview Decide: This is correct. Decision follows Interview."

The loop_onboarding Logic: LOOPOnboard skip. This forces Onboarding to execute at least once. Then the loop condition. If skip is the second child usually the semantics are LOOP body exit_condition."

Model 2 Anomalies: Screen vs Interview: No dependency. You can interview before screening. This is an efficiencyprocess hygiene issue. Its bad practice waste of resources but technically possible. Interview Decide is preserved. Payroll optional: XORPayroll skip. Loop Onboarding: A bit unusual but not logically impossible."

Logic: Can I interview a candidate without screening them? Yes technically. It is bad practice but the process flow can physically happen. Verdict: Moderate Anomaly. Model 2 Flaw: Skipping Payroll.
