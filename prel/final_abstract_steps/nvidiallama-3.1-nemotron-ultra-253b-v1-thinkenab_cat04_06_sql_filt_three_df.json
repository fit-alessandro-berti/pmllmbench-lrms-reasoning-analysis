We need to check for three consecutive events in that order with no other events in between. So the row numbers can help here. For each event in the case, assign a row number ordered by timestamp. Then, check if for e1, the next row_number is e2s row_number (i.e., e1.row_num +1 = e2.row_num), and similarly for e2 to e3."

Find all triples (e1, e2, e3) where: - e1.activity = Approve Purchase Requisition - e2.activity = Create Order - e3.activity = Confirm Order - e1.row_num +1 = e2.row_num - e2.row_num +1 = e3.row_num 3.

    "Text": "But how to do this efficiently in SQL? Maybe using self-joins. Alternatively, we can use LAG and LEAD functions. Wait, but LAG would look at previous events, LEAD at next. But since the sequence is three events in a row, maybe using multiple window functions. Alternatively, for each event, check if its the first of the sequence, and the next two events form the rest of the sequence. So, for each e1 in the row_numbers CTE where e1.activity is Approve..., check if the next row (e2) is Create Order and the row after that (e3) is Confirm Order, and that e2 and e3 are consecutive. But how to get e2 and e3 for each e1? Perhaps using a subquery that for each e1, checks if there exists an e2 and e3 in the same case with the required activities and row numbers."

If a case has the three events but the time between Create and Confirm is 3 days, then its not in problematic_cases, so their events are included. If a case has the three events but theres another event between Approve and Create, then e1.rn +1 would not be e2.rn, so the join would not find it, so its not excluded.
