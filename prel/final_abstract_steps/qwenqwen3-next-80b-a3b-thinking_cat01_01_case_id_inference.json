    "Text": "Looking at the events, each has timestamp, activity, resource, department, patient_age, patient_gender, and additional_info. The key here is that for a single case, the patient's age and gender should stay the same throughout all their events. Because each patient has a fixed age and gender. So if two events have different ages or genders, they must be different cases."

Age 28, M 10. Age 62, F 11. Age 62, F 12. Age 45, M 13. Age 28, M 14. Age 62, F 15. Age 45, M 16. Age 28, M 17. Age 62, F 18. Age 28, M So looking at age and gender, they seem to repeat. For example, age 45 male appears in events 1,4,7,12,15. Age 62 female in 2,5,8,10,11,14,17. Age 28 male in 3,6,9,13,16,18."

Event 1: Register patient (ER) Event 4: Initial triage (ER) Event 7: X-ray imaging (Radiology) Event 12: Doctor consultation (ER) with diagnosis hairline fracture Event 15: Patient discharged (ER) with followup outpatient clinic That seems like a logical flow.

    "Text": "So each of these three groups has consistent age and gender. So maybe these are three separate cases. Wait, but let's check if there's any overlap or if some events could belong to different cases. Let's see. For example, event 3 is Register in Surgery department. Then event 6 is Doctor consultation in Surgery. That seems like a surgery case. Then event 9 is surgery prep, 13 surgery performed. So yes, that's all part of the same case."

That's normal. The 62F case: register ER, triage, lab test requested in ER, then lab completed in Lab department, then doctor consultation in ER, prescription, discharge. Yes, that all makes sense."

But looking at the data, all the Surgery department events for age 28M. The only Surgery department events are: Event 3: Register patient, Surgery 6: Doctor consultation, Surgery 9: Surgery prep, Surgery 13: Surgery performed, Surgery 16: Recovery room, Surgery 18: Discharged from Surgery. So all these are same age and gender. So that's one case. For ER department: events 1,2,4,5,7 (X-ray in Radiology, but maybe part of ER process?), 8,10,11,12,14,15,17. But the X-ray for 45M is part of their case. So event 7 is X-ray for 45M, which is part of their ER case. Similarly, lab tests for 62F. So the three groups based on age/gender seem correct."

Similarly, 62F: ER, Lab, etc. So yes. So each case has a fixed age and gender. So three cases. Let me list each case. Case 1: Age 45, Male. Events: 1. Register (ER) 4. Triage (ER) 7. X-ray (Radiology) 12. Doctor consultation (ER) with diagnosis hairline fracture 15. Discharged (ER) Wait, but event 12 is doctor consultation in ER. Then 15 discharged. Makes sense. Case 2: Age 62, Female. Events: 2. Register (ER) 5. Triage (ER) 8. Lab test requested (ER) 10. Lab completed (Lab) 11. Doctor consultation (ER) diagnosis minor infection 14. Prescription created (ER) 17. Discharged (ER) Case 3: Age 28, Male. Events: 3. Register (Surgery) 6. Doctor consultation (Surgery) reason scheduled surgery 9. Surgery prep 13. Surgery performed 16.

Because even if two patients have same age and gender, but in this dataset, since all the events for same age/gender are consecutive in their own sequence, but in the interleaved data they're mixed, but the key is that each case's activities are for the same patient. Therefore, the three groups are: Case A: age 45, male Case B: age 62, female Case C: age 28, male So the answer is to group them into three cases based on these attributes."

Each unique combination of age and gender forms a separate case."
