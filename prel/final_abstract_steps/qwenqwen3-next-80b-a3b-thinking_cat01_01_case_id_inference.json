So if two events have different ages or genders, they must be different cases."

Age 62 female in 2,5,8,10,11,14,17. Age 28 male in 3,6,9,13,16,18. So that's three different groups based on age and gender."

Because even if two patients have same age and gender, but in this dataset, since all the events for same age/gender are consecutive in their own sequence ... the key is that each case's activities are for the same patient. Therefore, the three groups are: Case A: age 45, male Case B: age 62, female Case C: age 28, male"
