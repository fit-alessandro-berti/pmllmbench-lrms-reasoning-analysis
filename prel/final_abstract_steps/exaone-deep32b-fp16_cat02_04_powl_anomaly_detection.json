    "Text": "The XOR operator between Check_Credit and skip enables the process to bypass the credit check step. Skipping credit checks poses a risk as it allows orders to be approved without assessing customer creditworthiness. This violation of standard practices could lead to financial risks such as bad debts."

    "Text": "The LOOP operator wrapping Approve_Order and Issue_Invoice could lead to repeated approvals and invoicing. This structure introduces the possibility of multiple cycles (e.g., A -> I -> A -> I), which is non-standard and could result in process inefficiencies or redundant approvals/invoices."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Standard Order-to-Cash workflows generally follow a linear path: after approval and invoicing, payment is received, and the order is closed. However, the structure here allows deviations such as skipping steps (via XOR) and repeated iterations (via LOOP), which are atypical behaviors."
