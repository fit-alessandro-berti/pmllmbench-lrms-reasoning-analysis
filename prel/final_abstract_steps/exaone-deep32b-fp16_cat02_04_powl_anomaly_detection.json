So the process starts at R, then must go to xor_credit (either C or skip), then to loop_approve_invoice (which allows looping A and I), then to P, then O. So the loop_approve_invoice is a single node in the higher-level structure, but internally it's a loop of A and I. So the loop can repeat A and I as many times as needed."

    "Text": "Another thing to check: the loop's structure. The LOOP operator in POWL might require that the loop's children (A and I) are executed in sequence, and then the loop can repeat. So each iteration is A followed by I. So the first time through, you do A then I. Then, after I, does it loop back to A again? That would mean the process could have multiple approvals and invoices. For example, after the first A and I, it goes back to A again. So the loop allows multiple cycles of approve and invoice. That's definitely not standard. Normally, once you approve and invoice, you move to payment. So this loop is a major anomaly."
