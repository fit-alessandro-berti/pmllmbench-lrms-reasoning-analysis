    "Text": "Starting with Case 1001. The activities are: Create Requisition, Approve, Issue PO, Receive Goods, Vendor Invoice, Match Invoice, Release Payment, Close. That seems to follow the standard order. All steps are there in the right sequence. No issues here."

    "Text": "They issued the PO before the requisition was approved. Normally, you need to approve the requisition before issuing a PO. Also, the Vendor Invoice came in before the goods were received. In the standard process, you should receive the goods first, then get the invoice, then match them. Here, the invoice is received on 2024 02 03, but the goods are received on 2024 02 04. Also, the payment is released before the invoice is matched. Thats a problem because you usually need to match the invoice to the PO and goods before releasing payment. Plus, the approval of the requisition happens after the PO was issued and the invoice was received. Thats definitely an anomaly."

    "Text": "Thats a big problem. In standard practice, you cant release payment without having the goods and the invoice. Here, they released payment on 2024 02 08, but the invoice was received on 2024 02 09, and goods on 2024 02 10. So the payment was released before the invoice and goods. Thats a major anomaly. Also, the invoice was received after the payment. Thats not possible in normal process. Plus, the match happens after the payment. So this case has multiple issues: payment before goods and invoice, invoice after payment, and the match after payment. Thats very problematic because it could lead to paying for goods that werent received or invoices that arent matched properly."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Case 1004: Create Requisition, Approve, Receive Goods, Issue PO, Vendor Invoice, Match Invoice, Release Payment, Close. Here, the PO is issued after receiving goods. Thats unusual."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Typically, you issue the PO before receiving goods. If you receive goods before the PO is issued, that might be a problem. For example, maybe the goods were received without a PO, which could lead to unauthorized purchases. Also, the order here is Create Requisition, Approve, then Receive Goods before Issuing PO. Thats not standard. So this case has an anomaly where the goods were received before the PO was issued. Thats a problem because the PO is supposed to be issued first, then the goods are received. If the goods come in without a PO, thats a possible fraud or error."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "So summarizing the anomalies: Case 1002: PO issued before requisition approval, invoice before goods received, payment released before invoice matching. Case 1003: Payment released before goods and invoice, invoice received after payment, match after payment. Case 1004: Goods received before PO was issued."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "These are the main issues. Each of these steps deviates from the standard P2P process, which could lead to financial discrepancies, fraud, or operational inefficiencies. For example, paying before goods are received could mean the company is paying for something they didnt get. Receiving goods without a PO might indicate unauthorized purchases. Not matching the invoice properly could lead to overpayment or underpayment."
