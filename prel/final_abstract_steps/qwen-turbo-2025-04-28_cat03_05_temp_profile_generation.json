First, the directly connected pairs: ('SS', 'OP'): (1, 0.5) # 1 day, 12 hours std ('OP', 'RC'): (7, 2) # 7 days, 2 days ('RC', 'QI'): (1, 0.5) ('QI', 'CA'): (3, 1) ('CA', 'PT'): (5, 2) ('PT', 'PK'): (1, 0.5) ('PK', 'WS'): (1, 0.5) ('WS', 'DT'): (3, 1) ('DT', 'AS'): (7, 3) Then, pairs that are two steps apart: ('SS', 'RC'): average would be SS-OP (1) + OP-RC (7) = 8 days. Std would be sqrt(0.5^2 + 2^2) = sqrt(0.25 +4) = sqrt(4.25) 2.06. So maybe (8, 2.1) ('OP', 'QI'): OP-RC (7) + RC-QI (1) = 8 days, std sqrt(2^2 + 0.5^2) = same as above.

    "Text": "Another approach: think of the average times for different pairs. For example: Shorter paths (direct or one step) have lower average times. Longer paths have higher averages.

Similarly, for other pairs: ('OP', 'RC'): (7, 2) ('OP', 'QI'): (8, 2.5) ... Then, pairs like ('RC', 'WS') would be RC to QI (1) + QI to CA (3) + CA to PT (5) + PT to PK (1) + PK to WS (1) = 11 days. Std sqrt(0.5^2 + 1^2 + 2^2 + 0.5^2 + 0.5^2) = sqrt(0.25 +1 +4 +0.25 +0.25) = sqrt(5.75) 2.4. So maybe (11, 2.5)."

However, the user says to estimate these times, so I can use numbers, but they should be plausible.

Wait, the user says Do not provide explicit numerical temporal information in the prompt, but the example has numbers.
