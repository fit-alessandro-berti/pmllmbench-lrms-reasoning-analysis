But he didn't do any subsequent actions in that file before 09:07:15, so maybe we consider them separate sessions? Alternatively, perhaps that first focus event is just a stray event where he started to look at Quarterly_Report and then switched to Document1, indicating a preliminary check or something like \"Review Report Layout\".

Given that process mining event logs are typically aggregated to show actual work steps, I lean toward omitting low-level control events like SWITCH. ...

For example, for the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 from Document1 to Email, we might decide that this event belongs to the \"Email\" session because it indicates switching away from Document1 and moving to Email. ... Alternatively, maybe I'll create an extra activity for these switch events with a generic case id \"ContextSwitch\" so that they are captured separately. ... Alternatively, I can simply drop the SWITCH events ... I think it's acceptable to include all events except those that are clearly transitional ...
