But wait, timeline shows that after the first session, theres an email and PDF process event that are distinct from Document1 editing. Maybe grouping by application could be considered: Each distinct file or activity is separate? However, instructions say that a case can represent a logical unit of user work such as editing a specific document. The provided log includes multiple documents. So one possible approach is to assign a case id based on the document being edited in Microsoft Word, Excel or PDF etc. But then we see that Document1.docx appears twice: first session (09:00-09:01) and second session (09:06 onward). But are they logically part of same process? The user was editing Document1.docx. Its possible that these two sessions belong to the same document, but are separated by a break due to email processing and PDF reading.

So maybe these two sessions are parts of the same process instance (editing Document1) because they are for the same document?

But if the entire session is one business process instance then we can assign a single case id for all events (like Case001 or similar) and then use activity names that indicate what was done with which application. The question: A case can represent a logical unit of user work, such as editing a specific document, handling a particular email, or reviewing a certain PDF. That implies that each distinct task is its own case if they are separate units. But the log might also be interpreted as one overall session with multiple tasks. I lean towards grouping them by application/document because its more standard in process mining to have one case per transaction or instance. However, the instructions mention that the final event log should tell a story of user work sessions. I think creating separate cases for each distinct activity (document editing, email handling, PDF review, Excel editing) would be most coherent. But then what about Document1.docx appearing twice? Should they be combined into one case since its the same document? But they are not contiguous; there is a gap in between. However, if we consider that the user eventually returned to edit the same file, then they might belong to the same overall process instance (a single report editing session). But then why did he close Document1 doc after saving at 09:01:15? It doesnt explicitly say closed; it says saved and then later its reopened.

The challenge is that a SWITCH event crosses sessions, so its ambiguous which case id to assign. Maybe I can assign each raw event its own derived case id if needed. For example, for the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 from Document1 to Email, we might decide that this event belongs to the Email session because it indicates switching away from Document1 and moving to Email. Similarly, the SWITCH event at 09:06:00 from Excel to Word Document1 would belong to the Document1 session. We have to decide on boundaries. The logical sessions I identified are: Session A: Work on Document1 (first editing session) starting with FOCUS at 09:00 and ending with SAVE at 09:01:15. Then Session B: Email handling from 09:02:00 to 09:03:20, but then also a preceding SWITCH event that transitions into email. So I can assign the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 as part of the Email session because it indicates starting that work. But what about if theres already a FOCUS event for Email? There is no explicit FOCUS on Email though; instead, the first event in the email session is a CLICK event at 09:02:00 with Action=Open Email about Annual Meeting. So maybe I assign: - Session A (Doc1) includes events from 09:00:00 FOCUS (Document1) to 09:01:15 SAVE (Document1). - Then the SWITCH event at 09:01:45 belongs to transitioning out of Doc1 and into Email, so I can assign it to session B if we want to capture context switching. - Session B (Email) then starts with event at 09:02:00 CLICK action=Open Email about Annual Meeting. And then SCROLL at 09:02:30, then CLICK reply at 09:02:45, then TYPING at 09:03:00, and then CLICK send email at 09:03:20. - Then next event is SWITCH at 09:04:00 from Chrome to Acrobat PDF. That can be considered a transition between email and pdf review session. But then the PDF session events are SCROLL (09:04:30) and HIGHLIGHT (09:04:45). - Then next event: FOCUS on Microsoft Excel at 09:05:00, TYPING events for Excel budget editing (09:05:15, 09:05:30), SAVE at 09:05:45. - Then SWITCH at 09:06:00 from Excel to Word Document1. That transition belongs to session for Document1 (session A resumed). - Then TYPING on Document1 at 09:06:15 (Inserting reference to budget), SAVE at 09:06:30, CLOSE at 09:07:00. - Then FOCUS on Microsoft Word Quarterly_Report.docx at 09:07:15, TYPING (09:07:45), SAVE (09:08:00), CLOSE (09:08:15). Now I have multiple sessions. But then what about the initial event at 08:59 FOCUS on Quarterly_Report? That might be a stray event that doesnt belong to any session because no further editing occurs until later. Possibly its an aborted attempt, or maybe it should be attached to the Quarterly Report session. I can attach it to the Quarterly Report session if I consider it as preliminary focus. But then timeline order: 08:59 FOCUS on Quarterly_Report, then 09:00 FOCUS on Document1 (session A). So if I merge them into one case for Quarterly Report, the events would be non-sequential with respect to Document1 editing. They belong to different sessions. I think its best to create separate cases: Case QuarterlyReport: All events related to Quarterly_Report.docx, i.e., 08:59 FOCUS and then later at 09:07:15 FOCUS, TYPING, SAVE, CLOSE.

Its a boundary. Possibly assign it as part of Doc1 session ending or part of Email session starting. Since it indicates leaving Doc1 editing and going to email, I might assign it to Doc1 session if we consider that the work on Doc1 ended at 09:01:15. But then it transitions out. Alternatively, I can drop this event as its a control-flow transition. Maybe Ill include it but mark it as End Editing Session, and assign case id Doc1.

This likely marks transition between email and pdf review session. I can include this as a control-flow event with activity name Switch Application but then assign it to which case? Possibly mark it as part of the Email session ending or the PDF session starting. But since its clearly a boundary, maybe Ill omit it. But instructions said transform all events. I could include it with a generic case id Transition, but that might not be useful for process analysis if we want to see separate cases. Alternatively, I can assign it to Email because the email session ended before this event? But then the next events are PDF review so maybe assign it to PDF. Maybe better: Include transition events as well, each with a generic case id ControlFlow. That might be acceptable.

That starts the Excel session, so assign case id Excel, Activity: Open Spreadsheet. At 09:05:15 TYPING in Excel with Keys Update Q1 figures -> Case Excel, Activity: Edit Spreadsheet. At 09:05:30 TYPING in Excel with Keys Insert new row for Q2 -> Case Excel, Activity: Edit Spreadsheet. At 09:05:45 SAVE in Excel, window=Budget_2024.xlsx -> Case Excel, Activity: Save Spreadsheet. Then event at 09:06:00 SWITCH from Excel to Microsoft Word Document1.docx. This is a control-flow transition between Excel and Doc1. I can include this as: Timestamp: 2024-12-11T09:06:00.000Z, Activity: Switch Application: From Excel to Document1, assign case id maybe Transition or ControlFlow. Then next events for Document1 session resumed: At 09:06:15 TYPING in Word Document1 with Keys Inserting reference to budget -> Case Doc1, Activity: Edit Document At 09:06:30 SAVE in Word Document1 -> Case Doc1, Activity: Save Document At 09:07:00 CLOSE Microsoft Word Document1.docx -> Case Doc1, Activity: Close Document Then next events: At 09:07:15 FOCUS on Microsoft Word Quarterly_Report.docx -> assign case id QuarterlyReport, Activity: Open Document (for Quarterly Report) At 09:07:45 TYPING in Quarterly_Report with Keys Executive Summary draft -> Case QuarterlyReport, Activity: Edit Document At 09:08:00 SAVE in Quarterly_Report -> Case QuarterlyReport, Activity: Save Document At 09:08:15 CLOSE Microsoft Word Quarterly_Report.docx -> Case QuarterlyReport, Activity: Close Document And then what about the initial event at 08:59 FOCUS on Quarterly_Report.docx? I already planned to include it in the QuarterlyReport case. But if I now want them to be merged into one session, then they should have the same case id. So assign that event as well: At 2024-12-11T08:59:50 FOCUS on Word Quarterly_Report.docx -> Case QuarterlyReport, Activity: Review Document maybe, or Initial Focus. I can use Open Document but then later events are Edit Document. But the initial event might be considered as Preliminary Review if no editing is done. However, instructions say each event should correspond to a meaningful activity. The FOCUS action itself may not be meaningful on its own. Maybe Ill assign it as Activate Document with a note that its an initial focus. But Ill include it."
