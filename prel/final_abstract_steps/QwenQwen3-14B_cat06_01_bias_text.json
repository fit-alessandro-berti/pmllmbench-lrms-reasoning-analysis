    "Text": "But wait the problem says that this adjustment isnt disclosed to applicants Also the underwriters might subconsciously favor these applicants because theyre associated with local community groups which they perceive as correlated with financial responsibility But is this a bias Well the adjustment is based on geographic location and community ties which might not be directly related to creditworthiness For example someone from a different region might have a similar credit history but not get the boost So thats a potential bias because its using factors that arent directly related to the applicants ability to repay the loan"
