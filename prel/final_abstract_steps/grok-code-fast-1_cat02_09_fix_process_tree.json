    "Text": "The parallel block allows tasks like Create PO, Receive Goods, and Receive Invoice to occur in any order, which can lead to issues. This flexibility means actions like paying an invoice could happen before matching it, which isn’t ideal. Receiving goods before creating a PO is another unwanted scenario in the current parallel setup. The standard process suggests a more sequential flow is needed for accuracy and efficiency."

Create Purchase Order follows, then Receive Goods, ensuring goods aren’t received without an order. Receive Invoice can potentially happen alongside Receive Goods but is typically needed before Match Invoice. Match Invoice to PO and Pay Invoice must follow, with Close Case as the final step to complete the process."
