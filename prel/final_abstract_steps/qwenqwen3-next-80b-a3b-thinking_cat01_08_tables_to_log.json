    "Text": "First, I need to identify all possible events for each order. Let's start by looking at each table and what events they can contribute. Starting with the Orders table. Each order has an order_date. So for each order_id, there's an Order Created event. The timestamp is order_date. The resource here might be the sales_person_id. But wait, the sales_person_id is a reference to the Resources table. Next, the Order Lines table. Each line item has item_picking_date and picker_id. So for each line item, there's an Item Picked event. Then Delivery table. Each delivery record has dispatch and arrival dates. So for each delivery, there's Order Dispatched and Order Arrived events. Then the Invoice table. Each invoice has invoice_issue_date. So Invoice Issued event. Payments table: each payment has payment_date. So Payment Received event."

    "Text": "The Resource column would be the actor, so for Order Created, the Resource is the sales person's name. Other attributes could include customer_id, customer_type, order_priority. Similarly, for Order Lines, each line item's event would have item_id, quantity, etc. For Delivery Dispatched: resource is carrier_id, attributes: delivery_id, carrier_id, delivery_note. For Invoice Issued: billing_person_id would be the resource. For Payments, the resource could be left blank or filled with System."

    "Text": "For each line item, there's an Item Picked event. The activity name could be Item Picked with the item_id or maybe the description. But the problem says Activity Name should be descriptive. Maybe Item Picked and then include item_id or description as an attribute. But wait, the problem says one row per event. So if an order has two items, each picked at different times, then there would be two separate Item Picked events. So for order 1001, two items picked on different dates, so two events."

    "Text": "Looking at the Delivery table, order_id 1004 is not present. Wait, Delivery table has order_id 1001, 1002 (two entries), 1003, 1005. Order 1004 is in Orders table but not in Delivery table. So does that mean the order wasn't delivered? But maybe there's a delivery missing. Or maybe order 1004 has no delivery yet. But according to the data, Delivery table has no entry for 1004. So perhaps the order was not delivered. But the problem says to include all events for every order_id. So if there's no delivery, then there's no Dispatched or Arrived events. But the order may have been created, items picked, but not delivered. So for order 1004, there's no delivery events. Similarly, check if order 1004 has invoices. Let's see Invoice table: order_id 1004 is not present. So no invoice. So no payment."

For Item Picked: item_id, item_description, quantity, etc. For Delivery Dispatched: delivery_id, carrier_id, delivery_note. For Arrived: same. For Invoice Issued: invoice_id, invoice_amount. For Payment Received: payment_id, payment_method, payment_reference, and maybe invoice_id. The columns would be: Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, Resource, customer_id, customer_type, order_priority, item_id, item_description, quantity, delivery_id, carrier_id, delivery_note, invoice_id, invoice_amount, payment_id, payment_method, payment_reference.

    "Text": "Now, let's list all events sorted by timestamp, regardless of order_id. So events from different orders can be interleaved. For example, order 1001's Order Created is earliest, then order 1001's first item picked at 2024-01-02T10:15Z, which is before order 1002's created at 12:30. Then order 1001 dispatch on 2024-01-03T08:30, etc. So the chronological order would be: 1. 1001 Order Created: 2024-01-01T09:00:00Z 2. 1001 Item Picked (ITEM-001): 2024-01-02T10:15:00Z ... and so on, listing all in order."

Wait, 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z is earlier than 09:30, so after the dispatch of DLV-5004 on 06th 07:30, next is 06th 08:00 (item picked for 1004), then 06th 09:00 for invoice. So adjust the list: 15. Item Picked 1004 ITEM-001: 2024-01-06T08:00:00Z 16. Invoice Issued 1001: 2024-01-06T09:00:00Z 17. Item Picked 1005 ITEM-007: 09:30 18. Item Picked 1005 ITEM-002: 09:45"

So maybe just omit that column, but the task says optional but recommended. So if not, maybe not. But perhaps the payment method could be considered as the resource. Hmm. Not sure. Let's assume for Payments, resource is System for clarity."
