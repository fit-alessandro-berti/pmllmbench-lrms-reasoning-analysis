Analyze the Request: * Input: A Python dictionary representing a DECLARE process model (loan application review). * Task: Modify the model to add constraints that mitigate bias related to sensitive attributes (Age, Gender, Race). * Constraints: Must follow the specific DECLARE dictionary structure (unary vs. binary, support/confidence keys). * Output: The updated Python dictionary and a rationale explanation. * Context: Loan application process. Activities include StartApplication, FinalDecision, RequestAdditionalInfo."

    "Text": "Strategy: The prompt suggests adding constraints like Decision cannot immediately follow Sensitive Attribute Check without Mitigation. To do this effectively in a DECLARE model, I need to define the activities involved in these new constraints. Decision: I will introduce new activities necessary for the bias mitigation logic (e.g., AssessSensitiveAttributes, ManualReview, BiasMitigationCheck) because the prompt explicitly asks to enforce constraints involving these concepts."
