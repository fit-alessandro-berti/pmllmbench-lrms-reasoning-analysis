Initial contact and documentation review: - What are the most common documents that are missing or outdated? - How long does the documentation review process typically take? - What happens if a landlord is unable to provide the required documents? 2. Assignment of a property manager: - How is the property managers workload assessed? - What is the criteria for geographic specialization? - How is experience with similar property types determined? - What happens if no property manager is available or suitable? 3. Property inspection and marketing preparation: - How is the photographer and inspector scheduled? - What are the most common issues found during inspections? - How is the pricing model updated based on market trends? - Who is responsible for addressing the issues found during inspection? 4. Tenant screening and lease finalization: - What are the criteria for selecting a suitable tenant? - How are promotional discounts decided? - What is the process for handling multiple interested tenants? - How are custom lease clauses handled? 5. Quality checks and internal audits: - What are the key areas checked during the compliance review? - How is the financial verification process conducted? - What happens if the lease does not adhere to fair housing regulations? - How are data entries verified by the IT department?"
