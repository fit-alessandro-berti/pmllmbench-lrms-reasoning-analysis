    "Text": "Directly-Follows Constraints If the first activity occurs then the second activity shall occur immediately after So for consecutive steps we can set directly_follows But directly_follows would require that CA immediately follows RO in the trace That might be too strict because there might be other activities in between But in this process the activities listed are the main ones and they likely occur in sequence without other activities So maybe directly_follows is applicable for each consecutive pair But then what about QC After PI QC might happen later not immediately But in a single case trace events are ordered If we assume no other events then PI is immediately followed by QC Possibly but there could be time gaps but in event logs timestamps order them Directly-follows constraint means that in the trace whenever A occurs the next event is B That would force a strict sequence with no branching or parallelism But this process seems linear so directly_follows might be used for all consecutive pairs But if an activity can be skipped then directly_follows might break For example if QC is skipped then after PI next is PO But then PI directly follows RI And PO directly follows PI But if QC is present then QC should be between So we cannot have both PI QC and PI PO in directly_follows because after PI both QC and PO cannot both be immediate only one can be next So directly_follows constraints must be such that for each activity there is at most one successor So for a linear process with optional steps we cannot use directly_follows for all pairs because skipping a step changes the immediate successor Therefore we need to decide which steps are mandatory and which optional and set constraints accordingly"

    "Text": "But if all are mandatory and in fixed order then we can use directly_follows for each consecutive pair But then if any activity is skipped the constraint fails So for a strict linear process thats fine But the user might expect a realistic model where some activities can be skipped For example if items are not available CA might fail and order cancelled Then subsequent steps dont occur But the scenario doesnt mention cancellations So perhaps all orders proceed fully But to be safe we can allow some activities to be optional via activ_freq But for constraints if we want a strict linear process we can set directly_follows for all consecutive pairs But what about RP RP might not occur in the case if payment not received yet So RP count can be 0 or 1 So if RP occurs it occurs once But other activities occur once if they occur So counts are not necessarily all equal because RP might be 0 while others 1 But for activities that occur they all occur once So for any two activities that both occur they both occur once But if one occurs and the other doesnt equivalence doesnt apply because condition is if the first activity occurs So for pair A B if A occurs then B must occur same times So if A is RP and B is RO then if RP occurs RO must occur and both once RO always occurs so if RP occurs RO occurs once so same count But if RP doesnt occur no condition So for any pair where A is an activity that may occur and B is mandatory then if A occurs B occurs once but A occurs once so same But if both are optional then if A occurs B must occur Not necessarily So to have equivalence we need that whenever one occurs the other occurs with same frequency In this process if we assume that all activities except RP are mandatory when the case exists But RO is mandatory so if any activity occurs RO occurs Not necessarily if RP occurs does that imply the whole process happened Probably yes because RP is last so if RP occurs then all previous must have occurred But the constraints might not enforce that From directly_follows chain if RP occurs then IC must have occurred immediately before But does that imply all previous Not directly from that pair But we also have D IC so if IC occurs then D must have occurred immediately before Actually from IC RP if IC occurs then RP occurs immediately after Thats the opposite direction the pair is A B meaning if A occurs then B occurs immediately after So IC RP means if IC occurs then RP occurs immediately after That does not say that if RP occurs IC occurs Its one-way A B So if we have IC RP then RP cannot occur without IC Actually if RP occurs it doesnt force IC to occur from this constraint alone But from other constraints We might have always_before RP IC meaning if RP occurs then IC must have occurred before So to ensure that RP implies IC we need always_before RP IC or something So directly_follows IC RP only forces that when IC happens RP follows immediately But RP could potentially happen without IC No because if RP occurs what was the previous event It could be something else But if we have only these activities and we have directly_follows for all consecutive pairs then the only way RP can occur is if IC occurred immediately before Not necessarily directly_follows constraints are conditional on the first activity occurring They dont prevent an activity from being first or from having a different predecessor unless constrained by always_before So to enforce that RP only occurs after IC we need always_before RP IC Similarly to ensure that IC only occurs if D occurred before always_before IC D etc So for a strict linear order where each activity must follow its predecessor we need both directly_follows for each consecutive pair A B ensures if A occurs B occurs immediately after And always_before B A ensures if B occurs A occurred before Not necessarily immediately but if we also have directly_follows A B then from directly_follows if A occurs B is next so if B occurs A must be previous because there are no other activities between But if there are other activities not in the chain it could be different But if we have directly_follows for all consecutive pairs in the chain and no other activities then the only possible predecessor for B is A Not exactly directly_follows A B means that whenever A happens B happens next But it doesnt prevent B from happening without A For example could we have a trace RO then some other activity X then CA But if X is not in the set of activities we assume only these activities occur So in a trace containing only these activities if we have directly_follows RO CA then after RO next must be CA But what if CA occurs without RO That would be a trace starting with CA That doesnt violate RO CA because RO didnt occur So we need to prevent CA from being first Thats always_before CA RO if CA occurs RO must have occurred before So together directly_follows RO CA and always_before CA RO ensure that RO and CA always appear consecutively with RO first Not necessarily consecutively always_before only requires RO before CA not immediately But with directly_follows RO CA if RO occurs CA must be immediate But if CA occurs always_before requires RO before but not necessarily immediate But if CA occurs and RO occurred before and there are no other activities then RO must be immediately before because if there were an activity between that activity would have to be something else but we have only these activities So if the trace contains only RO and CA then they must be consecutive But if there are other activities say RO then X then CA but X is not in our activity set We assume only these activities are present So in a trace over this alphabet if we have always_before CA RO and directly_follows RO CA then CA cannot have any activity between RO and CA because if there is an activity Y between then from RO to Y But we dont have constraint from RO to Y So its possible Lets think suppose trace RO PI CA This would violate nothing RO CA says if RO occurs then CA must occur immediately after In this trace after RO comes PI not CA so violates directly_follows RO CA So to have RO PI CA we would need directly_follows RO PI and PI CA etc But if we only have RO CA then after RO next must be CA so PI cannot be between So directly_follows forces immediate succession And always_before CA RO forces that RO must occur before CA So together they force RO and CA to be consecutive with RO first What about a trace that starts with CA That would have CA without RO before violating always_before CA RO So prevented Thus for a strict linear chain where each activity must follow its predecessor immediately and no other activities can intervene we can use for each consecutive pair A B directly_follows A B always_before B A But always_before B A is redundant if we have directly_follows A B and no other activities Not completely as said directly_follows A B doesnt prevent B from being first But with always_before B A B cannot be first because if B occurs A must have occurred before So if we have both then B must be preceded by A and since directly_follows says when A occurs B is next then A and B are consecutive What about a trace A X B If X is another activity then after A X occurs violating directly_follows A B because B is not next So not allowed So the chain is enforced But if we have multiple consecutive pairs with directly_follows then the whole sequence is fixed For example with RO CA CA RI RI PI etc then the only possible order is RO CA RI PI consecutively And always_before for each non-first ensures they dont appear out of order or without predecessor But always_before for B A where A is predecessor ensures that B cannot appear without A But with directly_follows chain if A appears B must appear next so B appears But if B appears without A That would violate always_before So needed"
