Event 1: age 45, gender M, department ER Event 2: age 62, gender F, department ER Event 3: age 28, gender M, department Surgery Event 4: age 45, gender M, department ER should be same as event 1 Event 5: age 62, gender F, department ER should be same as event 2 Event 6: age 28, gender M, department Surgery should be same as event 3 Event 7: age 45, gender M, department Radiology but Radiology is a department, and patient came from ER, so likely for patient 45 Event 8: age 62, gender F, department ER lab test requested by Dr. Smith Event 9: age 28, gender M, department Surgery surgery preparation Event 10: age 62, gender F, department Laboratory lab test completed, so for patient 62 Event 11: age 62, gender F, department ER doctor consultation with Dr. Smith Event 12: age 45, gender M, department ER doctor consultation with Dr. Lee Event 13: age 28, gender M, department Surgery surgery performed by Dr. Lee Event 14: age 62, gender F, department ER prescription created by Dr. Smith Event 15: age 45, gender M, department ER patient discharged Event 16: age 28, gender M, department Surgery recovery room Event 17: age 62, gender F, department ER patient discharged Event 18: age 28, gender M, department Surgery patient discharged"

For Case 2: events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17 2: 08:07:02 5: 08:12:29 after registration 8: 08:16:10 after triage, lab requested 10: 08:20:27 lab completed 11: 08:22:54 consultation after lab results 14: 08:27:00 prescription after consultation 17: 08:35:29 discharged after prescription Makes sense.
