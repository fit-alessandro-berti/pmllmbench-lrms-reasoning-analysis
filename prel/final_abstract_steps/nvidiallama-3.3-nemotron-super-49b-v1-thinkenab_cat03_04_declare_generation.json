So for 'existence', all activities must exist. So each activity in the list should be present with support 1.0 and confidence 1.0. But wait, maybe some steps can be skipped? The problem says \"each product idea goes through a series of steps\", but maybe some steps are mandatory. For example, Approval Gate (AG) must happen before launch. Similarly, Final Launch (FL) must occur. So perhaps all activities are mandatory. So 'existence' would include all activities. But maybe some can be skipped?

For example, if IG happens, then DD must happen after. But since all activities are mandatory and in a fixed order, perhaps each activity A is responded by the next activity B. So for responded_existence, the keys would be pairs like (IG, DD), (DD, TFC), etc., each with support and confidence 1.0.\n\nBut wait, responded existence is a bit different. The constraint is that if A occurs, then B must occur after A. Since all steps are mandatory and in order, every activity except the last (FL) would have a responded existence constraint with the next activity. So the responded_existence dictionary would have entries for each pair in the sequence except the last one.\n\nWait, but FL is the last, so there's no activity after it. So responded_existence would include all pairs where A is followed by B in the sequence.

But that's a lot. However, perhaps it's more efficient to use 'precedence' or 'succession' instead.\n\nWait, 'precedence' is a constraint that A must precede B.

So to fully enforce the order, coexistence is needed for all pairs where A precedes B in the sequence.\n\nBut in our case, since the process is a total order, coexistence would require all such pairs. However, manually listing all 45 pairs is not feasible. But the problem expects a Python dictionary, so perhaps we can generate these programmatically. However, the user probably expects a manual construction based on the scenario description.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coexistence constraint is not necessary here because the process is modeled with precedence or succession constraints.

However, the 'response' constraint in DECLARE is per pair. So for example, if we have a 'response' constraint between IG and FL, it would require that if IG occurs, then FL occurs after IG.
