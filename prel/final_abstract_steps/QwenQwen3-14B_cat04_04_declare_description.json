Then looking at the 'response' constraint for 'Receive_Application' pointing to 'Preliminary_Credit_Check', so after receiving the application, the next step is the credit check. The 'exactly_one' constraint on 'Preliminary_Credit_Check' means only one such check is done."

Wait, no, the 'coexistence' might mean that both activities must occur, but I need to check the DECLARE model definitions again. Wait, 'coexistence' in DECLARE usually means that two activities must occur together, but here it's under 'coexistence' with 'Gather_Additional_Documents' targeting 'Authorize_Contract_Terms'. Maybe that's a chainprecedence or something else. Hmm, maybe I should look at the 'chainprecedence' and 'chainsuccession' as well."

But there are also alternative paths, like the 'altresponse' from Transfer_Funds to Notify_Customer, and 'altprecedence' from Notify_Customer to Transfer_Funds.
