  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",

    "Text": "Wait, window functions can compute the count over the partition of case_id. So: SELECT * FROM (SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) as cnt FROM event_log) sub WHERE cnt <=6; This might work. Because for every row, it calculates the count of the case_id, then filters where that count is <=6. Then the outer query selects all the original columns except the cnt."

  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "But let me check if there are any issues with the window function approach. Since the window function calculates the count for each case_id, even if the case has more than six events, but when you filter with cnt <=6, those rows from over-sized cases would not be included. Wait, no. Wait, if a case has 7 events, then for each of its 7 rows, the cnt would be 7. So when we filter cnt <=6, those rows (each of the 7) would be excluded. So that works."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, which is more efficient? The window function requires calculating the count for every row, which might be O(n). But the subquery approach first aggregates to get the case_ids, which is O(n) as well, then joins. Depending on the size, maybe the second approach is better because the subquery reduces the number of case_ids early."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Let me test the two approaches in my mind. Suppose a case has 5 events. All 5 events should be included. In the IN approach, the subquery selects that case_id, so all 5 rows are included. In the window approach, each of the 5 rows would have cnt=5, so they pass the WHERE clause. For a case with 7 events, in the IN approach, the case_id is excluded, so none of their rows are selected. In the window approach, each of their 7 rows have cnt=7, so the WHERE clause excludes them. So both methods work."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Therefore, the recommended approach is the IN approach. Hence, the correct answer is the IN subquery method."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but let me think of an example. Suppose the table has case_id A with 3 events, B with 7. The subquery would return A, so the IN clause would include all events from A. Yes. Another scenario: case C has 0 events? But since each row is an event, a case_id with 0 events wouldnt have any rows, so its not in the table. Therefore, the query is correct."
