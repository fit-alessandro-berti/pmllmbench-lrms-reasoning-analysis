    "Text": "First, I need to thoroughly understand the normative description. It outlines two main scenarios: sufficient inventory (full fulfillment path) and insufficient inventory (cancellation path). Key constraints I notice: - Check inventory must always come right after Receive order and before any payment/fulfillment steps - For sufficient inventory: sequence must be Check -> Authorize Payment -> Package -> Ship -> Close - For insufficient inventory: sequence must be Check -> Cancel -> Close - Critical rules: * Payment authorization can't happen before inventory check * Packaging requires prior payment authorization * Shipping requires prior packaging * Cancellation must be followed by close, with no fulfillment activities after cancel * Close order is always final"

    "Text": "Case 2 catches my eye immediately - they packaged items BEFORE authorizing payment. The normative description explicitly says Package items should only occur after authorization. This violates the payment-before-packaging rule. Also, the sequence shows they did Package -> Authorize -> Ship, which is completely backwards."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3 is messy. After Cancel order, they somehow did Ship order! The description is very clear: Ship order should never occur after cancellation. Plus, they authorized payment THEN canceled - which might be questionable, but the bigger crime is shipping after cancellation. That's a major violation."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Case 4 looks clean: Receive -> Check -> Cancel -> Close. Exactly the cancellation path. No fulfillment activities after cancel - good."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 5 is missing Package items entirely! The normative description states Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping. Here they went straight from Authorize to Ship. The description implies packaging is mandatory before shipping - it says items must be prepared before they can be shipped. So skipping packaging violates the packaging requirement."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Hmm... I should double-check if packaging could be optional. But the description says the normal progression should continue as follows: ... Package items. Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with Ship order. That sounds mandatory. No ambiguity here - packaging is required before shipping in fulfillment path."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also confirming Case 3's payment authorization before cancellation: while the description says payment authorization only makes sense after inventory check (which happened), it doesn't explicitly forbid authorization when inventory is insufficient. But since they later canceled, the authorization was pointless - however the real violation is shipping after cancel, which is explicitly forbidden."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
