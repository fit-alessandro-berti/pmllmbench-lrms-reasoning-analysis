The rising temperature and vibration, along with material flow, indicate that the machine is actively cutting metal."

    "Text": "Explanation for each group: 1. Initial Setup (Idle) - Events 1-3, 13-15: These events show the machine at rest with no material flow, no vibration, and low energy. 2. Cutting Metal - Events 4-6: There is a sudden rise in temperature, vibration, and material flow. 3. Assembling Parts - Events 7-8: The temperature remains around 40 C, pressure increases to 2 bar, vibration is moderate, and material flow is reduced. 4. Welding - Event 9: A spike in temperature (80 C) and vibration (50 Hz) and the highest energy consumption (5.00 kWh) occurs. 5. Quality Inspection - Events 10-12: After welding, the machine cools down, vibration is low, and material flow is minimal."
