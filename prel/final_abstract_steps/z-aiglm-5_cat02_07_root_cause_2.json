High Complexity 2003 2005 48-77 hours. Multiple requests for documents 2 to 3 times. Insight There is a strong positive correlation between Complexity and Duration. Higher complexity leads to Request Additional Documents loops significantly extending the process."

Insight Region itself doesnt seem to be the primary driver of slowness independent of complexity. However looking at the slowest High Complexity case Case 2005 Region B 77h vs Case 2003 Region A 48h. Region B seems to struggle more with High Complexity claims than Region A. Why Resource analysis might help here. Correlation with Resource Adjusters Adjuster Mike Region A Handled 2001 Low and 2003 High. 2003 took 48 hours had 2 document requests. Adjuster Lisa Region B Handled 2002 Medium 2004 Low and 2005 High. 2005 took 77 hours had 3 document requests."

Case 2003 High Requests at 1100 and 1700. Case 2005 High Requests at 1130 1700 next day 1500 next day. This suggests an iterative struggle to get documents. Resource Region Interaction Adjuster Lisa Region B handled the slowest case 2005. She requested documents 3 times. Adjuster Mike Region A handled the second slowest 2003. He requested documents 2 times. Both handled High Complexity. Lisas case took longer. Hypothesis Adjuster Lisa might be struggling with High Complexity claims compared to Adjuster Mike 77h vs 48h for similar complexity or Region Bs process for gathering documents is less efficient."

Lisa Region B dragged it out over 3 days requests spread out. This suggests Lisa Region B has a performance issue specifically with handling the documentation gathering for high-complexity claims. The gaps between requests are huge. Approval Bottleneck check Manager Bill Last doc req to Approval gap is 19-23 hours Overnight wait."

Case 2002 Medium Docs Req 1400 Apr 1 Approve 1000 Apr 2 Gap 20 hours. This implies the approval step has a systematic delay for cases requiring documents or Manager Ann processed it next morning. However Manager Bill handles High Complexity. The gap for Bill 19-23h is similar to Anns gap for the Medium case 20h. Conclusion The approval stage introduces a next day delay for any case that isnt instant but the major delay in Case 2005 is the document gathering phase Adjuster Lisa."

Activity Request Additional Documents is the delay culprit. Resource Adjuster Lisa Region B is associated with the worst performance Case 2005. Her document requests were spread over 3 days. Adjuster Mike Region A handled high complexity faster Case 2003 finishing document needs in 1 day. Manager Bill processes complex claims the approval step adds 20 hours likely due to batching or workload whereas Manager Ann handles simpler claims quickly. Region Region B Case 2005 performed worse than Region A Case 2003 on similar complexity pointing to resource effectiveness Lisa rather than the region itself as the root cause."
