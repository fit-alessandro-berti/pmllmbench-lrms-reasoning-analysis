    "Text": "Okay, lets tackle this problem step by step. First, I need to understand the requirements for both the normative rules and the desiderata. The normative rules are strict, so any violation there is a problem. The desiderata are more about best practices but not mandatory. Starting with Part 1: Normative Process Behavior. The key constraints are the sequence of activities. The correct order is Application Received Credit Check Risk Assessment Loan Decision Inform Applicant if Approved then Finalize Documentation Close Case. Also, if rejected, no finalizing documentation before closing."

    "Text": "Looking at the event logs: Case 1: The sequence seems correct. Application received, then credit check, risk assessment, loan decision (approved), inform applicant, finalize documentation, close case. All steps are in order. No issues here. So Case 1 is compliant with normative rules."

    "Text": "Case 2: Application received, then Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check. Thats a violation of the sequence rule because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then later, Credit Check is done, but after Risk Assessment. But the normative rule says Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. So this is a clear violation. Also, after the loan decision (rejected), they did Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed if rejected. So Case 2 has two normative violations: wrong order of Credit Check and Risk Assessment, and finalizing documentation after rejection."

    "Text": "Case 3: Application received on 2024-01-12, Credit Check on 2024-01-14, which is more than 24 hours later. Thats a desideratum violation (timing recommendation), not a normative one. Then, the Loan Decision is on 2024-01-14, and Inform Applicant is on 2024-01-16, which is more than 48 hours after the decision. Thats another desideratum violation. Also, theres no Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. But all normative steps are followed: Credit Check before Risk Assessment, then Risk Assessment before Loan Decision, etc. So Case 3 is compliant with normative rules but has desideratum issues."

    "Text": "Now, for the desiderata: Case 2: The Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative violation, but the desideratum about timing isnt mentioned here. Wait, the desiderata include timing for Credit Check (within 24 hours) and informing the applicant (within 48 hours of decision). For Case 2, the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment, which is a normative issue, but the timing of Credit Check? Let me check. Case 2s Application Received is 2024-01-11 08:00, Credit Check is done at 08:20, which is within 24 hours. Wait, no, the problem in Case 2 is that the Credit Check was done after Risk Assessment. The Credit Check was done on 2024-01-11 08:20, but the Risk Assessment was done at 08:00. Wait, no, the event log for Case 2 says: Case 2: 2024-01-11 08:00: Application Received 2024-01-11 08:20: Risk Assessment (which is wrong because Credit Check should be before) Then 2024-01-11 09:00: Credit Check (so after Risk Assessment) Then Loan Decision (Rejected), then Finalize Documentation, then Close Case. So the Credit Check was done after the Risk Assessment. So thats a normative violation. The timing of Credit Check in Case 2: Application was received at 08:00, Credit Check at 09:00. Thats within 24 hours, so the desideratum is met. But the order is wrong. So for desiderata, Case 2s Credit Check is okay in timing, but the order is wrong. However, the desiderata arent about order, only timing and follow-up."

Then, the Inform Applicant is on 2024-01-16 15:00, which is 2 days after the Loan Decision (2024-01-14 12:00). Thats 48 hours and 3 hours later, which is over the recommended 48 hours. So thats another desideratum violation. Also, no Follow-up Call. So Case 3 has three desideratum issues."

    "Text": "So for the task: 1. Identify normative violations: Case 2: Credit Check after Risk Assessment (wrong order), and Finalize Documentation after rejection. Case 3: No normative violations. 2. Desiderata violations: Case 2: None (Credit Check was done within 24 hours, and the only normative violation is order, not timing. The desiderata are about timing and follow-up. So maybe Case 2 doesnt have desideratum issues except for the order, which is a normative issue. Wait, the desiderata include the Follow-up Call as a recommended but not required action. So even though the normative rules are violated, the desideratum of Follow-up Call is not met in Case 2. But the problem says that for desiderata, Case 2 may not have any, but maybe it does. Wait, the desiderata include the Follow-up Call as encouraged. So if the event log doesnt have it, then its a violation. But the users note only mentions Case 3. Hmm, this is a bit ambiguous. Maybe the user intended that only Case 3 is missing the Follow-up Call, and Case 2s event log might have it, but its not shown. But based on the data provided, I have to go with whats in the table. Since the table for Case 2 doesnt have a Follow-up Call entry, and the note for Case 3 does, maybe the answer should consider that both have it. But the users note only mentions Case 3. This might be a confusion. Let me recheck the users event log: In the event log, the user wrote: For Case 3: | 3 *(No Follow-up Call)* | So only Case 3 is noted. But for Case 2, the event log doesnt have a Follow-up Call entry. However, the user might not have included it in the table. So maybe the answer should consider that only Case 3 is missing the Follow-up Call, and Case 2s event log doesnt have it, but perhaps its not mentioned. However, the problem says that the desiderata include the Follow-up Call as encouraged. So if the event log doesnt have it, then its a violation. But the users note only mentions Case 3. Hmm. This is a bit tricky, but Ill proceed with the given data."
