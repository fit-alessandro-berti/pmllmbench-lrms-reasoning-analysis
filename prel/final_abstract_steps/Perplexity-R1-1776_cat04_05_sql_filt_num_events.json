So maybe I should start by grouping the event_log by case_id and counting the number of events per case. Then, filter those groups where the count is greater than six and exclude them."

    "Text": "Another thing: do we need to consider performance? If the table is large, but DuckDB handles these queries efficiently. The GROUP BY and HAVING in the subquery would compute counts per case and filter them quickly if there's an index on case_id, but DuckDB might not rely on indexes in the same way as traditional databases. However, for correctness, this approach should work."
