So the CulturalFitCheck in the fair model is a standard evaluation without any affiliation check. Therefore, the two models differ in whether the Cultural Fit step is a single activity or an XOR choice between two paths. Thus, the first model has the XOR, the second does not. I think this is correct."

So the loop_part would be the DataCompletenessCheck (A) and RequestMoreInfo (B). That seems right."

    "Text": "Another thing: the XOR in the first model is an exclusive choice. The problem says that it's an XOR choice between the two paths. So the OperatorPOWL with XOR and two children. Yes. Then, after either of the XOR branches, the process proceeds to Managerial Review. So in the POWL model, the XOR node is followed by ManagerialReview. Since in the partial order, the XOR node must come before ManagerialReview. In the code, the XOR operator's parent StrictPartialOrder has an edge from the XOR node to ManagerialReview. That's handled in the unfair model."
