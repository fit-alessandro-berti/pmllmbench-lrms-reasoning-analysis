    "Text": "Case 2 Application Received Risk Assessment No prior Credit Check Credit Check Loan Decision Rejected Finalize Documentation Close Case Here Risk Assessment is done before Credit Check That violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment Also after a rejection they did Finalize Documentation which is not allowed So two normative violations here"

    "Text": "Case 3 Application Received Credit Check more than 24 hours later Risk Assessment Loan Decision Approved Inform Applicant later than 48 hours Finalize Documentation Close Case The sequence is correct but the timing is off for Credit Check and Inform Applicant However these are desiderata violations not normative ones Also theres no Followup Call which is another desideratum"
