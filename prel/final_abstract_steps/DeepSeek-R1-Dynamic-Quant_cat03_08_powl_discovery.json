From the event logs, each case has a sequence of these activities. The examples show different paths through these steps."

So it seems like if Testing fails (TST), Re-Testing (RT) happens, but then you have to do TST again? Or maybe the loop is between TST and RT?"

After the initial steps (OR, MS, QS), next comes Assembly (AS). Then IQC. Now in Case 1 and 3, sometimes after AS and IQC, they go back to AS again. So perhaps there's a loop here: if IQC fails, you need to redo assembly? Or maybe the process allows multiple quality checks before proceeding."

Wait but according to POWL's Loop definition: * (A, B): you execute A first. Then you can exit or do B followed by A again.
