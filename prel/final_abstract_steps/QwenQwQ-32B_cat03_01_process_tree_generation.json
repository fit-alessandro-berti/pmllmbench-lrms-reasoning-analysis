The final code would have a root SEQUENCE containing all steps except where concurrency begins. The concurrency parts are handled by the appropriate operators. But due to the complexity, perhaps the following is a representative code outline: ... [Code Outline] ... Wait, but we need to have common_sequence have parents. is problem. Alternative, the common_sequence should not have parent assign yet. Maybe instead: The loop path is a sequence of loop and the common_sequence children. But this is quite unclear. So to avoid parent issues, perhaps the common path's SEQUENCE is cloned: For the loop branch common_for_loop = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE) common_for_loop.children = [ ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[ProcessTree(lbl='AI'), ProcessTree(lbl='NC')]), ... . too too involved. code parent. problem is intricate and time-consuming, but following the above outline should lead to a ProcessTree that adheres to the description. , the decision_node children loop_path normal_path. normal_path be the common_sequence its parent set to decision_node. we make normal_path the common_sequence: common_sequence.parent = decision_node loop_path children loop( parent=decision_node) and common_sequence2 (a copy). , the final code may have this structure. , the root's children.append these nodes properly."
