The process includes invoicing and recording payment at the end. So logically, invoice should occur after packaging or dispatching. But our chain has invoice (IC) coming after dispatch (D). And record payment (RP) follows invoice. So I already have that in directly_follows. Maybe add always_before for safety: (\"RI\", \"PO\") maybe not because reservation items is before picking items. We already have that sequence: RI -> PI -> QC -> PO. Maybe add always_before = {(\"IC\", \"RP\")} but that's already expressed as equivalence constraint. Maybe I'll add one more always_before: Always Before: RO must occur before RI. But in our chain, it's implied by directly_follows if we follow the full sequence? Actually, let's check: Our chain is RO -> CA -> RI -> PI -> QC -> PO -> GSL -> D -> IC -> RP. So yes, RO occurs before RI. I want to include some always_before constraints that are not captured by directly_follows: For example, maybe after \"RI\" there could be multiple events but always before \"PO\", for instance, if additional steps occur between reservation and picking? Not sure. Given the chain is linear, all ordering can be expressed with directly follows. But to illustrate usage of always_before constraint, I might add a couple of non-immediate order constraints: Maybe: (\"RI\", \"QC\") means if RI occurs then QC must eventually occur in some later event (which it does). Also maybe: (\"PO\", \"RP\"): but that's not true because invoice happens after dispatch. I can include always_before = {(\"RO\", \"IC\"), (\"RI\", \"D\")} But check chain: RO occurs before D obviously, but RI is earlier than D too. Actually, let me consider: The constraint Always Before in log skeleton means that if the first activity occurs then the second must have been executed previously. So for any pair (A,B), whenever A occurs, B must occur before it? That doesn't sound right. Wait re-read: Always Before: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. This is ambiguous as to whether it means that the second activity is always before or after. The phrase should have been executed previously implies that when you see the first event, you expect the second event to be in a previous step. So if we add (\"A\", \"B\") then whenever A happens, B must appear earlier than A in the trace. In our chain, for example, \"IC\" occurs after D so if I want to enforce that invoice is always before payment, it should be expressed as (\"RP\", \"IC\"). Because when you see RP, IC has been executed previously. So let me use: always_before = {(\"RP\", \"IC\")}. But then what about the ordering of others? We could also add (\"D\",\"RP\") because dispatch occurs before record payment. But then invoice already appears earlier than D, but not necessarily. I'll propose: always_before = {(\"RP\", \"IC\")}. But wait, check our chain: we want to enforce that invoice happens before payment, so if a case contains a payment record, it must also contain an invoice and that invoice appears before the payment.

Alternatively, we could say: if reservation items (RI) occurs then, in one of the following events, pick items (PI) must occur. But that's not true because PI always directly follows RI in our chain. Maybe I'll set always_after = {(\"RI\", \"PO\")} but in our chain, PO comes after RI, so it fits. Alternatively, (\"IC\", \"RP\") might be used as always_after as well since RP occurs sometime after IC. But we already have equivalence constraint for that. I might say always_after is not explicitly needed given the linear nature of our process. However, the prompt expects a non-empty set maybe? Maybe I can add: always_after = {(\"PO\", \"GSL\")} but that's in directly_follows. Alternatively, we could consider: If an invoice customer (IC) occurs, then record payment (RP) will eventually occur. But that's also equivalence constraint. I might leave always_after as empty set if nothing else makes sense. Maybe I'll add: always_after = {(\"RI\", \"QC\")} because QC always happens after RI in our chain, but not necessarily immediately? Actually, directly_follows already ensures immediate succession. Wait, let me check the definitions: Equivalence constraint is about occurrence counts equality Always Before means that when A occurs, B must have occurred earlier. (Precedence constraint.) Always After means that if A occurs then B must eventually occur later. So perhaps I can define always_after to express eventual ordering: For example, Always After: (\"PO\", \"IC\"): If Pack Order occurs then Invoice Customer will eventually be executed in a subsequent event. That is true. Also, (\"RI\", \"PI\") might also be expressed as always after if not directly follows? But we already have directly_follows constraint for that. Maybe I'll define: always_after = {(\"PO\", \"IC\"), (\"RI\", \"PI\")} But then check our chain: RO -> CA -> RI -> PI -> QC -> PO -> GSL -> D -> IC -> RP. So yes, PO always is before IC and RI always comes before PI. However, these are already expressed as directly_follows constraints if we had them in the chain. But sometimes Always After doesn't imply direct succession but eventual occurrence. I could then add: always_after = {(\"PO\", \"IC\"), (\"RI\", \"PI\")} But note that they already appear as directly follows: I have defined directly_follows for RO->CA, CA->RI, RI->PI, PI->QC, QC->PO, PO->GSL, GSL->D, D->IC, IC->RP. Thus if I add always_after = {(\"PO\", \"IC\"), (\"RI\", \"PI\")} it is redundant with directly_follows. But maybe that's fine. I might also add an always_after constraint for a non-immediate ordering: For instance, if Quality Check (QC) occurs then Dispatch (D) will eventually occur (but QC comes before PO which comes before GSL which comes before D, so not immediate). So I can define: always_after = {(\"QC\", \"D\")} That seems more interesting. So let me set always_after = {(\"PO\", \"IC\"), (\"RI\", \"PI\"), (\"QC\", \"D\")}. But then check chain: QC is executed and later D is executed, so that's valid.
