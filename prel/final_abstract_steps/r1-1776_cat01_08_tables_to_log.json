So every event must be linked to an order_id."

But looking at the data for order 1001: ITEM-001 was picked at 10:15 and ITEM-002 at 11:00. So two separate Items Picked events? But maybe each item picking is part of a larger activity. Alternatively, maybe Items Picked as one event per order_line?"

Or perhaps each item picking is an event. The example given in the prompt includes Items Picked event(s) from Order Lines table, which suggests that there can be multiple events here. So yes, each line in Order Lines would generate an Item Picked activity with the timestamp as item_picking_date and resource as picker_id."

Since an order can have multiple deliveries (like order 1002 has two deliveries), these would generate two events per delivery (dispatch and arrival). Invoice table: each invoice is an Invoice Issued event with invoice_issue_date and billing_person_id as the resource. Payments table: each payment corresponds to a payment received for an invoice. But since invoices are linked to orders via order_id, each payment would relate to an invoice which relates to an order. So when a payment is made against an invoice for an order, thats a Payment Received event for that order."

But since its optional and not specified whether needed, perhaps stick to required columns plus Resource/Actor unless instructed otherwise. Alternatively, add some attributes like customer_type or item details where applicable? Probably better to focus on required columns first unless instructed otherwise. The user said at minimum those columns but others can be added if available. However, lets see examples given in task Derive Activities: Examples include mapping activities like Items Picked from Order Lines; so maybe include item_ids? For example, when you have multiple Items Picked events per case/order_id including which items were picked? But Activity Name would be Item Picked, but perhaps including item details in Other Attributes? Yes! Because otherwise you wouldnt know which items were involved in each picking activity. Similarly for deliveries—include delivery_note or carrier info? Yes! Let me check: In Delivery tables delivery_note might contain useful info like Partial backorder which could affect process flow analysis. Similarly for invoices—invoice amount might be relevant as an attribute. Payments—payment method could be useful attribute. So including these details would make the event log more informative for process mining analysis."

Item Picked: Other attributes would include item_id and quantity from Order Lines table. Order Dispatched/Arrived: Other attributes could include carrier name (from Resources) or carrier ID? Or delivery_note from Delivery table? Wait carrier name can be derived via carrier_id mapped to Resources.resource_name where role=Carrier. For example CR-01 maps to GlobalTransport etc., so when creating Dispatch/Arrived events, use carrier name as part of attributes or resource/actor? Wait earlier thought was that Resource/Actor can be Carrier name here because Dispatch/Arrival might involve Carrier company as actor rather than individual person. For example: Activity Name = Order Dispatched Resource/Actor = GlobalTransport (CR-01) Similarly for arrival. Yes! Because Dispatch is done by Carrier company CR-01 which is GlobalTransport according to Resources table."

    "Text": "Similarly Invoice Issued would have Billing Clerk name from Resources.resource_name where billing_person_ids match BL codes like BL+001 Gina Carter etc. Payment Received doesnt have a direct actor/resource in data provided unless inferred from some other logic—but Payments table doesnt link to any person IDs except through invoices billing_person_ids? No—each payment is tied to an invoice via invoice_id which has its own billing_person_id in Invoice table but payment itself isnt directly linked except through that chain. However this might not necessarily mean that the same billing clerk processed the payment—its possible that another department handles payments once invoices are issued. Since theres no explicit data linking payments to actors/resource IDs here, its safer not to assign a resource here unless instructed otherwise by assumptions made during integration steps mentioned in prompt instructions (If data missing/ambiguous document assumptions). Thus assumption here would be that Payment Received does not have associated resource/actor information available based on provided tables; hence leave Resource blank or N/A for those entries unless instructed otherwise via assumption documentation which user allows us making assumptions if data missing/ambiguous)."
