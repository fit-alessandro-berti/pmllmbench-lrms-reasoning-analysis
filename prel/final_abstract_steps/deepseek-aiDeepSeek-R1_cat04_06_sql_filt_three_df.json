Identify cases with the exact sequence Approve Purchase Requisition -> Create Order -> Confirm Order with no other activities in between. 2. Among those cases, check if the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. 3. Exclude such cases and return all events from the remaining cases."

    "Text": "Let me break down the first part: finding the sequence. Since they need to be in direct succession, there cant be any other activities between them. So for each case, the events should have these three activities consecutively. One approach is to assign a row number per case, ordered by timestamp. Then, for each case, check if there are three consecutive rows where the activities are in the specified order. Alternatively, using window functions like LEAD to look at the next activities. For example, for each Approve Purchase Requisition in a case, check if the next activity is Create Order, and the one after that is Confirm Order. Yes, that could work. Using LEAD twice."

    "Text": "For the time difference, between Create Order and Confirm Order, which are the second and third activities. So in the triplet, the Create Order is at position n+1, and Confirm Order is at n+2. So the timestamp of Create Order would be the timestamp of the n+1 row, and Confirm Order is the n+2 row. But in the query, when we use LEAD(timestamp, 1), we get the timestamp of the next activity, which is Create Order in this scenario. Then LEAD(timestamp, 2) would give the Confirm Order timestamp. Original row (n): activity is Approve..., timestamp t1. Row n+1: activity Create Order, timestamp t2. Row n+2: activity Confirm Order, timestamp t3. So the time between Create and Confirm is t3 - t2. In the current row (n), LEAD(timestamp, 1) is t2, LEAD(timestamp, 2) is t3. So the difference is (t3 - t2)."

    "Text": "So the plan is: 1. For each case, check if there exists a triplet of consecutive events in the order specified. 2. Among those cases, check if in any such triplet, the time between the second and third event is >5 days. 3. Exclude all events from those cases. But note that the LEAD functions are based on the order of the events, so as long as they are ordered by timestamp, the next and next_next_activity would correspond to the next events. So the triplet_check will correctly capture consecutive events. But what about the order of events? Since events are ordered by timestamp, the LEAD functions will look at the next events in chronological order. So if a case has the three activities in order, but with other activities in between, then the LEAD would not capture that. For example: Event1: Approve, timestamp 1 Event2: Some other activity, timestamp 2 Event3: Create Order, timestamp3 Event4: Confirm Order, timestamp4 In this case, the LEAD(activity,1) from Event1 is Some other activity, which breaks the sequence. So the triplet isnt captured. Therefore, the query correctly identifies only consecutive triplets."

    "Text": "Edge Cases: - A case has multiple triplets, some meet the time condition and some dont. For example, one triplet has a time difference of 6 days, another has 4 days. The case should be excluded because at least one triplet meets the criteria. - The same activity occurs multiple times in a case. For example, Approve Purchase appears multiple times, and in one of them, the next two activities are correct. The query will find that case if any of the triplets meet the criteria. Another consideration: the DATEDIFF function. In DuckDB, the syntax for DATEDIFF is DATEDIFF(day, start, end). So yes, thats correct. Also, the day part will compute the number of days between the two timestamps. So if create_order_time is 2023-01-01 10:00:00 and confirm_order_time is 2023-01-06 11:00:00, the DATEDIFF is 5 days, which is not more than 5. But if confirm is 2023-01-07, then its 6 days, which is more. So the condition DATEDIFF(...) >5 would capture those cases where its more than 5 days."
