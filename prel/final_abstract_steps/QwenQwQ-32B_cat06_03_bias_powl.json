    "Text": "If D is checking if the applicant is local and part of a known community group, those who pass D might get a better score. But who gets to take the D path versus skipping? Hmm, maybe the selection into the XOR branch is based on attributes that correlate with membership in certain groups."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe the choice of taking the D branch is not random. Suppose that applicants who are part of a local community or live locally automatically go through D, adding a scoring bonus. But others (non-locals) skip D, so they miss that potential uplift."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe the XOR is structured so that if you don't meet some criteria (like being a local), you have to skip D, meaning that non-locals can't get that uplift."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the scenario is that the system branches into D or skip, and in doing so, the path D offers an advantage (score uplift). If the selection into D is done in a way that certain non-protected groups are more likely to be routed through D, they get the uplift, leading to preferential treatment over other groups, particularly those who are legally protected but don't receive that uplift."

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Even if the criteria for D are neutral (like being a resident), the social networks, wealth, etc., might mean that certain groups are more likely to be local and part of community groups, thus gaining disproportionate benefits. Thus, even without intent, the system embeds structural biases."

  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - NE",
    "Text": "Alternatively, suppose the XOR’s condition for D selection was not linked to local affiliation but purely random. In such a case, the bias wouldn’t occur because the uplift would be equitably distributed across groups. The flaw arises because local affiliation correlates with non-protected group membership."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The implications would be that if the system is more likely to route non-protected group members to the D path, they get higher scores and better loan terms, worsening fairness for protected groups who were not in those communities."
