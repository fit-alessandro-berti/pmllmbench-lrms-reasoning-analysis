    "Text": "In summary the problem with the XOR is that the routing into D or skip can lead to scoring advantages only for a certain path If that path is taken more often by a specific non protected group or avoided by a protected group but legal constraints prevent addressing that directly The result is that while the bank isnt breaking laws theyre creating inequities that harm certain demographics especially if the D check criteria are based on factors that correlate with protected statuses indirectly leading to disparate impact but possibly not in a legally actionable way"
