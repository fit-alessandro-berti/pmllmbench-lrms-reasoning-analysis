    "Text": "The process starts with an invoice arriving, with initial steps identifying whether a valid purchase order (PO) exists, as described by Mary (Interview 1) and corroborated by Dan (Interview 2). Typical patterns involve logging into the system for POs and forwarding invoices to Purchasing."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "From the accounts provided by Mary and Dan, it is deduced that the presence of a PO determines whether invoices can proceed to the system logging step or are sent back to suppliers."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Carlos, as observed in Interview 3, outlines a final review pattern where invoices are checked for alignment with budgets or expectations before approval."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "By generalizing from the handling of discrepancies mentioned by Mary and Dan, typical discrepancy pathways either lead to resolution or escalation. Exceptions like informal contracts may require alternative handling by Rita, as noted in Interview 4."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The paths identified so far were validated with the additional layer provided by Karen (Interview 5), who assists indirectly in resolving issues with suppliers to ensure the process can continue."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "When details were unclear, such as handling missing PO responses, it was reasoned that suppliers must send corrected invoices, which restart the process flow."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "It was hypothesized that rejected invoices loop back for rework, but exact details were absent in the transcripts, leaving ambiguity regarding reentry points."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "If discrepancies are never escalated or resolved, the workflow hypothesizes complete process stalling until human intervention occurs, which would align with Rita's account."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Handling exceptions ethically, especially the creation of retrospective POs for informal contracts, was considered, as mentioned in Rita's input. This ensures compliance while preventing undue rejection of legitimate invoices."
