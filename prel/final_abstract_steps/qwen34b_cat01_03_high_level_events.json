    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem. So, I need to group these low-level events into higher-level process steps. The example given has two cases, A1 and B2, which seem similar. Let me look at the events for each case. Starting with Case A1: The first few events are about retrieving a metal sheet, scanning a barcode, placing it on the table, aligning it, and preheating. Then there's picking up a welding tool, welding two corners, measuring the weld, applying a coating, drying it, and a visual check. Similarly, Case B2 follows the same sequence but with different part IDs and timestamps. The steps are similar, so the grouping should be consistent across both cases."

Then comes the welding, which is part of assembly. Then quality checks, and then finishing steps like coating and drying. So, maybe the first group is \"Material Preparation\" which includes retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating. Then \"Welding and Assembly\" for the welding steps. Then \"Quality Inspection\" for the measure and visual check. Then \"Coating and Drying\" for the coating and drying steps."

So the order is: after welding, they measure the weld, then apply coating, dry, then visual check. That seems a bit odd, but maybe the visual check is a final step. Hmm."

    "Text": "Another approach: look for the sequence of events. The first five steps (retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat) are all about getting the material ready. Then the welding steps.

The measure weld is done before coating and drying. So the order is correct."

    "Text": "So the rationale would be:\n- Material Preparation includes all steps to get the raw material ready for processing.\n- Welding and Assembly are the steps where the metal sheet is welded.\n- Quality Inspection is the step to check the weld quality.\n- Coating and Drying are the steps to apply and dry the coating.\n- Final Quality Check is the last step to ensure the product is ready."
