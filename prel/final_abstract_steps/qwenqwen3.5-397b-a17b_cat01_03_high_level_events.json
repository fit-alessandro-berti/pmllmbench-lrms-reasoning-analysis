Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1) 6. Pick up welding tool (Operator B) 7. Weld corner A (Operator B) 8. Weld corner B (Operator B) 9. Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1) 10.

    "Text": "Wait, Measure weld integrity feels like Quality Control. Refinement: Lets separate Assembly from Finishing. Alternative: 1. Material Preparation: Retrieve, Scan, Place, Align, Preheat. 2. Assembly & Welding: Pick tool, Weld A, Weld B. 3. Inline Quality Check: Measure weld integrity. 4. Surface Treatment: Apply coating, Dry coating. 5. Final Inspection: Visual check. Simplification for High-Level View: Group 1: Material Setup... Even Higher Level: Usually, we want 4-6 main steps. Decision: I will group based on the physical state change... Lets try to consolidate to 4 main phases... Best Approach for Manufacturing Context: Follow the production line stations. Revised Plan: 1. Material Preparation 2. Assembly (Welding) 3. Intermediate Quality Check 4. Surface Finishing 5. Final Inspection. Self-Correction: Grouping non-contiguous events... Correction: I must respect the sequence."
