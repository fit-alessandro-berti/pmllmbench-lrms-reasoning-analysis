However, according to the normal process, Confirm Shipment should come before Ship Goods. So, the main anomalies I see are: 1. Out-of-order activities (like Credit Check after Ship Goods in case 1002, Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment in case 1003, etc.) 2. Missing activities (case 1004 missing Credit Check and Validate Stock) 3. Inappropriate timing (case 1004 payment received too quickly)"

Maybe using window functions to check the order. For missing activities, check if all required steps are present. For timing, look for events that happen in a time frame thats too short. Also, maybe some resources are not following the correct steps. For example, maybe a resource from a different department is performing an activity. But the resources table has roles and departments. For example, the Credit Check is done by Finance, which is correct. The Validate Stock is done by Logistics. Wait, in the normal flow, Validate Stock is step 3, which is done by WarehouseClerk (Logistics department). So thats correct. But maybe in some cases, someone else did it? Not sure, but maybe thats another point."

    "Text": "So, possible SQL queries: 1. Check for cases where the order of activities deviates from the expected sequence. For example, using a CTE to assign a step number based on the expected order and then check if the actual sequence matches. 2. Check for missing activities in any case_id. For example, if a case doesnt have all the required steps. 3. Check for cases where certain activities happened in an unexpected time frame (like payment received before invoice issued). 4. Check if the resources involved in each activity are from the correct department/role. For example, Credit Check should be done by Finance department. Let me draft these queries. For the first one, to check the order of activities, I can assign a step number based on the expected order and compare the actual order. But since the activities are in the order_event_log table, I need to order them by timestamp and check the sequence. Another approach is to use the expected order and check that for each case_id, the events are in the correct order. For example, for each case, the first event should be Register Order, then Credit Check, then Validate Stock, etc. Alternatively, using a CASE statement to assign a priority to each activity and then check if the events are ordered correctly. For missing activities, I can check for each case_id if all the required activities are present. For example, using a query that lists all the required activities and checks if they exist for each case. For the timing issues, maybe look for events that are too close in time. Like, if the payment is received before the invoice is issued, or if the time between Register Order and Receive Payment is less than a certain threshold. Also, for the case where the payment is received before the invoice is issued, thats a problem because usually, the invoice is issued first. So, checking if theres an event of Receive Payment that occurs before the corresponding Issue Invoice event. Another thing: in case_id 1004, the Confirm Shipment is done with shipment_scheduled=N, but then Ship Goods is done. That might be an error, as Confirm Shipment with N might mean its not scheduled, but they still shipped. So checking the additional_info for Confirm Shipment where shipment_scheduled is N, and then Ship Goods is done. So, the SQL queries would need to address these points. Let me structure them."
