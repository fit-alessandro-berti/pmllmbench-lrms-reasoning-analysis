    "Text": "I see that events 13 look very similar low temperature around 20 low pressure 1 no vibration no flow position 0 low energy This might be an idle or startup phase Now from event 4 onwards things change Event 4 temp jumps to 50 vib to 30 flow to 5 pos to 5 energy to 200 Then event 5 and 6 show increasing temp and vib with position changing Event 7 and 8 are stable but different temp 40 press 2 vib 10 flow 2 pos 15 Event 9 high temp 80 high vib 50 no flow pos 15 high energy 500 Event 10 temp drops to 30 vib low flow 0 pos still 15 Event 11 and 12 temp 25 vib 5 flow 1 pos 20 Then it goes back to idle in events 1315 So I need to group these into phases Lets look for clusters where readings are similar"
