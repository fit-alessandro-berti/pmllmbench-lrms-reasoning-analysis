Cutting Metal: High vibration (30-38) increasing temperature (50-58) material flow (5) tool position changing – indicative of a machining process where material is being cut causing heat and vibration. Assembling Parts: Stable temperature (40) moderate vibration (10) lower flow (2) fixed tool position – suggests careful assembly where parts are being fitted together without high energy. Welding: Very high temperature (80) high vibration (50) no material flow – typical for welding where heat is applied to join materials. Quality Inspection: After welding temperature drops low vibration no flow – could be a period where the machine or product is checked for quality. Packaging: Low temperature low vibration low flow tool position changing – might involve moving the product for packaging."

Idle or Waiting: Events 1-3, 13-15 Rationale: All sensor readings are low and stable indicating no active operation possibly waiting or startup. 2. Cutting Metal: Events 4-6 Rationale: Significant increase in temperature high vibration levels presence of material flow and changing tool position suggest a cutting or machining activity that generates heat and vibration. 3. Assembling Parts: Events 7-8 Rationale: Stable moderate temperature and vibration with some material flow and fixed tool position indicative of assembly where parts are being put together carefully. 4. Welding: Event 9 Rationale: Very high temperature and vibration with no material flow typical for welding operations that require intense heat to join materials. 5. Quality Inspection: Event 10 Rationale: Rapid decrease in temperature and vibration no flow suggesting a cooling or inspection phase where the quality of the work is checked. 6. Packaging: Events 11-12 Rationale: Low temperature low vibration minimal flow and changing tool position possibly involving the movement and preparation for packaging the finished product."
