The model has a loop where E Evaluate Claim is followed by P Approve Claim making it exit loop again Wait the loop here is part of the OperatorPOWL code. The loop from A to P might cause E and P to be repeatedly executed. That leading to repeated evaluation and approval. Then theres an XOR between N and skip Customer notification which would skip normalizing that step. Also the partial ordering was set with A to C directly possibly allowing C before P or something."

    "Text": "Alternatively check for cases where after E evaluate no P happened yet. Alternatively checking that there are claims where the XOR event is connected but then approval happens before notify. Alternatively since the XOR can skip N so when the XOR chooses N over P unless forced via edges that indicates a skipped notification. Hmm perhaps the key is the XOR between N and skip if the model allows sometimes skipping N which is the problem."

To verify check claims where XOR skips N or where approval happened without evidence of notification. The database query would need to link between claims events and adjusters perhaps by joining tables where events and approve notify are linked and checking for missing N steps."
