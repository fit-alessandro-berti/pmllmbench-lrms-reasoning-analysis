    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "I proposed that cases like 104, with no escalation, experienced delays due to overloaded Level-1 agents or inefficient ticket queues. Similarly, escalations in Cases 102 and 105 might require process automation and streamlined routing to reduce delays."
