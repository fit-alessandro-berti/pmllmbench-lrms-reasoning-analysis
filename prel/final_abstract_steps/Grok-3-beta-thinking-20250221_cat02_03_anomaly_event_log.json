After that, the goods are received, and then the vendor sends an invoice. The invoice is matched to the purchase order and the goods received, and if everything checks out, payment is released. Finally, the case is closed.\n\nSo, the standard sequence should be something like:\n\nCreate Purchase Requisition\nApprove Purchase Requisition\nIssue Purchase Order\nReceive Goods\nVendor Invoice Received\nMatch Invoice to PO\nRelease Payment\nClose Case"

Let's see the order:\n\nCreate Purchase Requisition\nIssue Purchase Order\nWait, they issued the purchase order before approving the requisition? That doesn't make sense.

That's not standard practice. Usually, you wait for the invoice and verify that the goods have been received before making payment.\n\nThis could be problematic because you might be paying for something that hasn't been delivered yet, or there could be discrepancies between the order and what was actually received.\n\nMoreover, matching the invoice to the PO happened after the payment was released, which means the verification step occurred too late."

In a standard P2P process, the PO is issued to the vendor as a formal request for the goods, and then the vendor ships the goods based on that PO. Receiving goods before issuing the PO suggests that perhaps the goods were ordered informally or through some other means, which could bypass proper procurement procedures.\n\nAdditionally, issuing the PO after receiving the goods might be an attempt to retroactively document the purchase, which could be a sign of poor process control or even an attempt to cover up an unauthorized purchase."
