After that, Excel for Budget_2024.xlsx with updates, then back to Word Document1.docx again, add a reference, save and close.

Then after working on that document until 09:01:45, they switch to email. The work on Email happens from 09:02 till 09:03:20 when the email is sent. Then switching to Acrobat at 9:04 for Report_Draft.pdf, scroll and highlight. After that, Excel budget file editing starts around 05:00.
