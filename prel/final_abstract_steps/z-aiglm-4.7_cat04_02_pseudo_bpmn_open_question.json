Looping back to Calculate Delivery Date might not make sense if the rejection was about terms, and looping back to Custom Quotation for standard requests is a logic gap.* * No -> Generate Final Invoice. * End: Send Confirmation."

    "Text": "Step 2: Identify Bottlenecks and Areas for Improvement 1. Manual Routing/Validation: Check Request Type and Perform Standard Validation likely involve manual triage. 2. Sequential Dependency: Approval happens after the full quote/delivery calculation is done. If rejected, work is wasted. 3. Rigid Paths: Standard vs. Custom is a hard split. Real life has shades of gray. 4. Resource Allocation: Parallel checks are static. If Inventory takes 2 days and Credit takes 2 hours, the whole flow waits 2 days. 5. Rejection Handling: The loop back on No for approval is inefficient (re-doing work). 6. Lack of Intelligence: No prediction of feasibility early on."

Predict feasibility score immediately. * Automation: * Auto-validate standard requests via API. * Automated Credit Checks (API). * Real-time Inventory checks (API). * Dynamic Resource Allocation: * If the Credit Check is complex, route to a senior analyst; if simple, auto-process. * Prioritize high-value custom requests in the Feasibility queue. * Flexibility/Parallelism: * Start the Feasibility check during the initial intake for borderline cases. * Parallel Checks should be asynchronous microservices, not just tasks in a diagram. * Process Redesign: * Move Pre-Approval screening earlier. * Split the No Approval loop into specific correction paths rather than a broad re-evaluation."

Detailed Analysis of Changes: Break down by the users requested categories. * Automation & Predictive Analytics (Intake & Triage).* * Dynamic Parallelism (Validation Checks).* * Flexible Sub-processes (Custom Path).* * Proactive Approval (Risk Management). 4.
