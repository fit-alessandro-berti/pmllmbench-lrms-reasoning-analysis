A BiasMitigationCheck should be performed before making a FinalDecision if sensitive attributes like CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, or CheckApplicantRace have been checked. 2. A ManualReview should be performed if sensitive attributes are checked and a FinalDecision is made. 3. A BiasMitigationCheck should be performed if a CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, or CheckApplicantRace activity occurs, so that any decisions made after these checks are verified for bias."

For precedence constraints, BiasMitigationCheck should occur before FinalDecision if any sensitive checks are made: 3. For a succession constraint, RequestAdditionalInfo should be followed by FinalDecision (already in the given model), but now we need another succession for BiasMitigationCheck and FinalDecision only if BiasMitigationCheck has been executed: 4. For coexistence, if CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, or CheckApplicantRace happens, ManualReview should also happen:"

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Rationale for Added Constraints: 1. response for BiasMitigationCheck after CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, or CheckApplicantRace: To make sure that once any sensitive attribute check is done, a BiasMitigationCheck is eventually performed. This makes sure that any potential bias introduced by checking sensitive attributes is addressed. 2. precedence constraint for BiasMitigationCheck before FinalDecision: This makes sure that BiasMitigationCheck must be done if there is a FinalDecision made in a trace where sensitive attributes are checked. 3. succession constraint for BiasMitigationCheck followed by FinalDecision: This makes sure that once a BiasMitigationCheck is performed, a FinalDecision should follow. 4. coexistence constraint for ManualReview whenever CheckApplicantAge, CheckApplicantGender, or CheckApplicantRace is done: To make sure that a manual review is also performed whenever a sensitive attribute check occurs. Such additional constraints help ensure that the process makes a fair decision regardless of the applicants sensitive attributes such as age, gender, or race."
