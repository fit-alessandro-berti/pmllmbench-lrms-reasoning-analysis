The keys like existence, absence, exactly_one, init are for individual activities. Their values are dictionaries where each key is an activity, and the value has support and confidence both 1.0 here. The other keys like response, precedence, etc., involve pairs of activities, so their values are dictionaries with tuples as keys representing activity pairs."

Similarly, Idea Generation IG once at the start. Wait, but exactly_one means that the activity occurs exactly once in the trace. So for IG, since its the first step and only once, we can include it in exactly_one. Similarly for FL. Other activities like TFC or CE might occur multiple times? Or maybe they are done once per process instance. Lets assume that each activity happens exactly once except maybe some steps. But given that its a product launch process, perhaps most steps are done once. But maybe Technical Feasibility Check could be revisited if issues are found. Hmm. But since this is a simplified model, perhaps we can assume each activity occurs exactly once."
