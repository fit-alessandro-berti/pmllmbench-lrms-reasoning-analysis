But the example mentions Reject_Minority, but maybe in the existing model, the decision is just Reject. So maybe the idea is that whenever Reject is made, if the applicant is from a sensitive group, then ManualReview must coexist. But how to model that in DECLARE, since activities can't have parameters. Hmm, maybe the process includes activities like Reject which must have ManualReview coexisting when certain conditions are met. Since DECLARE is based on activity sequences, perhaps the constraints are more general. Maybe the coexistence is between Reject and ManualReview so that whenever Reject occurs, there must be a ManualReview in the same trace. That way, every Reject must have a ManualReview in the process. That could ensure that all rejections are manually reviewed, which might help prevent bias. But maybe that's overbroad."

Since the model can't track the actual data (like Minority), the constraints have to be based on activities.

For example, after checking the applicant's race, the next step can't be a decision without a ManualReview."
