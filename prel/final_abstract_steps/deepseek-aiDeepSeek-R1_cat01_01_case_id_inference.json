Since each case should represent a single patients journey, events with the same age and gender are likely part of the same case, but Ill have to check if the departments and activities make sense together. Lets list out the events with their patient details:"

That makes sense. Case 2: F62, ER Event 2: Registration Event5: triage code 2 (more urgent) Event8: Lab requested Event10: Lab completed Event11: Doctor consult (diagnosis minor infection) Event14: Prescription (antibiotics) Event17: Discharge. This flow works. Case3: M28, Surgery Event3: Registration in Surgery dept Event6: Doctor consult (scheduled knee surgery) Event9: Surgery prep (anesthesia) Event13: Surgery performed (arthroscopy) Event16: Recovery room Event18: Discharge with physio follow-up. This sequence fits."

Timestamps are sequential and spaced reasonably. Case2 (F62): 2 (08:07),5 (08:12),8 (08:16),10 (08:20),11 (08:22),14 (08:27),17 (08:35). Also sequential. Case3 (M28): 3 (08:07:15),6 (08:13)  after registration. Then event9 (08:16:45), 13 (08:25:19),16 (08:31:37),18 (08:40:13). All in order."

For example, M28s surgery steps are all in Surgery or related departments like Radiology (but M45 went to Radiology). Additional info checks: - M45 has X-ray for left leg and diagnosed with fracture. - F62 had blood test, diagnosed with infection, given antibiotics. - M28 had knee surgery, recovery, etc."
