    "Text": "First, I'll scan the numerical data for obvious transitions. The first three events (1-3) show near-identical readings: low temp (20-21 C), zero vibration, no material flow, tool at 0mm. This screams idle state - machine is powered but inactive. Energy consumption (0.4-0.5 kWh) matches standby mode."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Then event 4 hits: temp jumps to 50 C, vibration appears (30Hz), material flow starts (5 units/s), tool moves to 5mm. Energy spikes to 2kWh. This feels like an operation starting. The steady flow rate and gradual tool position increase (5 to 7 to 10mm in events 4-6) suggest controlled movement - probably Cutting Metal since vibration is moderate (not extreme like welding) and pressure is stable at 1-1.5 bar."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "But wait, event 7 shows a shift: temp drops to 40 C, vibration halves (10Hz), flow slows to 2 units/s while tool jumps to 15mm. Pressure rises to 2 bar. The reduced vibration and slower flow hint at less aggressive activity. Maybe Assembling Parts? The tool position holding steady at 15mm for two events (7-8) supports assembly where parts are being joined without continuous movement."

    "Text": "Then event 9 shocks me: temp skyrockets to 80 C, vibration hits 50Hz (highest in log), energy soars to 5kWh while material flow stops. This has Welding written all over it - intense localized heat with no flow (since welding typically pauses material movement). Pressure stays at 2 bar, consistent with clamping during welding."

    "Text": "Post-welding, event 10 shows rapid cooldown (30 C), vibration nearly gone (1Hz), but tool still at 15mm. Energy drops to 1kWh. This transitional phase feels like Cooling/Setup Reset before next operation."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Events 11-12 show temp stabilizing at 25 C, slight vibration (5Hz), low flow (1 unit/s), tool moving to 20mm. The gentle parameters suggest Quality Inspection - slow movement for sensors to check parts, moderate energy for scanning systems."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Finally, events 13-15 revert to initial idle state: all sensors back to baseline. Tool resets to 0mm, flow stops. Classic Packaging/Shutdown where machine prepares for next cycle."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I notice the energy consumption patterns are particularly telling: cutting (2-3kWh), welding (5kWh peak), assembly (2kWh), inspection (1.5-1.6kWh) - each activity has a distinct energy fingerprint. Also, tool position changes correlate with activity phases: movement during cutting/inspection, static during welding/assembly."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The user's deeper need seems to be understanding how raw sensor data translates to process steps - they're likely testing if I can bridge numerical patterns to real-world operations without predefined labels. I should emphasize the sensor-activity causality in my rationale, especially for ambiguous transitions like event 7 (assembly start) versus event 10 (cooling phase)."
