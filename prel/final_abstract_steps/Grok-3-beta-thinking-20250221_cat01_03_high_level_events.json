    "Text": "First, I need to understand the event log. It's a sequence of events, each with attributes: CaseID, Timestamp, Activity, Resource, and AdditionalInfo. The sample provided shows events for two cases, A1 and B2, with similar sequences of activities. This suggests that the process is repetitive and follows a similar pattern for each case."

    "Text": "Initially, I considered grouping 'Measure weld integrity' into 'Assembly.' However, it made more sense as a separate quality inspection step because it's performed by a sensor rather than an operator."
