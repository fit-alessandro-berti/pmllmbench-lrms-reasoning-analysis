For example, in the code: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(fc_transition, ii_transition, net) This is adding an arc from the FC transition to the II transition. But that's not correct.

So perhaps the FC transition is connected to a place that is the start of the II and CA steps. Alternatively, the FC transition is connected to a place that has two transitions: one for II and one for CA. ... So, the correct way is to have the FC transition's output arc to a place that is the start of the II and CA steps. ... Alternatively, the model can have the FC transition leading to a place, which then has two transitions: one to II, one to CA. ...

But wait, the FC_out is a place, not a transition. So the code would now have: After adding the FC_out place, the transitions are: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N.
