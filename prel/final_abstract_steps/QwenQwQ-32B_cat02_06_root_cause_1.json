    "Text": "So possible factors here are Delays between escalation and next action like in case 105 28 hrs between escalate and the next investigate which could indicate that the Level 2 team took too long to start working on it Also if a case is escalated perhaps there is a big time expenditure but in 105 it s even worse since the escalation activity s next step took a huge delay Additionally in case 105 after the escalate when they reassigned to Level 2 maybe they didn t start until 1400 next day which is after a 28 hour delay So that s a potential issue long waiting time before the escalated team resumes work Another possible factor is time taken to complete steps For example in Case 102 the duration from triage to assignment was okay but investigate after escalate took time Alternatively the steps that take the longest For case 101 Triage quickly 10 mins assigned a few mins then investigation took 40 mins 820 to 900 then resolved The longest step there might not be major Wait in case 104 the assignment happened at 930 then they didn t start investigating until 1 pm 3 5 hours of delay between assign and investigate That seems like a long waiting time before they even start working on it That could be a cause of delay Similarly in case 104 between the assignment 930 AM and investigate 100 PM That s 3 5 hours Why the wait Whereas in case 103 assigned at 830 investigate at 845 so 15 mins That s quick So if the agents take a long time between assigning and starting to investigate that s a problem Another factor is that when a case is escalated there s time lost For example Case 102 was escalated on March1 at 1130 AM but before that after assignment at 9 AM they took 2 hours until escallation Maybe that s required but the next step after escalate took 2 5 hours to start investigating Hmm not a big delay but then after that 19 hours until resolved Maybe the Level 2 team works slower Wait in case 102 after 2 pm investigation the resolve is next day 9 AM 19 hours until resolve Alternatively in case 105 after escalate maybe the escalated team is very slow to do the investigation So that could be a problem with the escalation process s efficiency Another point in case 105 after the initial investigation they escalate but the escalate step itself is done at 1000 AM but the next investigate step is the next day which is a very long wait So maybe the escalated cases don t get prioritized So summarizing possible causes Long delays between certain activities especially between escalate and next investigation case 105 had 28h wait after escalate also between assignment and investigate case 104 waited 3 5h before starting Escalation itself adds time to the process but sometimes it s the time after escalation that s the problem like in case 105 where escalate to Level 2 didn t trigger immediate action Perhaps some steps like investigation take too long when done by Level 1 leading to needing escalation which compounds delays but case 105 s initial investigate was 10 mins before escalation but they might not have done enough Or maybe it was necessary to escalate but the escalation process is slow Wait another thing is the number of steps For example case 105 has two Investigate steps Or maybe the second one is after escalation Let me check Case 105 s timeline Investigate starts at 910 Then escalate at 10 AM Then another Investigate on 3 2 1400 next day So the Level 2 agent started investigating again meaning that the Level 1 agent passed it without finishing their part Maybe duplication of work or inefficiency Or perhaps after escalate the Level 2 has to start their own investigation which is time consuming So it might be inherent to more complex issues needing escalation but the process can be optimized"
