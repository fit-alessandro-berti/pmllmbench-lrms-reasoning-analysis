Starting with Case 2001: Submit at 09:00 on April 1st Close at 10:30 on the same day. So the duration is about 1 hour and 30 minutes. That seems quick. Case 2002: Submitted at 09:05 on April 1st Closed at 11:00 on April 2nd. total 25h55m 25.9 hours. Case 2003: Submitted at 09:10 on April 1st Closed at 09:30 on April 3rd. total 48h20m 48.3 hours. That's way longer than the others. Case 2004: Submitted at 09:20 on April 1st Closed at 10:45 same day. That's about 1 hour 25 minutes. Very fast, similar to case 2001. Case 2005: Submitted at 09:25 on April 1st Closed at 14:30 on April 4th. total is 72 + 5h5m = 77 hours and 5 minutes. Approximately 77.08 hours. That's the longest."

So cases with longer durations are 2002, 2003, 2005. But the user says significantly longer. Comparing the durations, 2005 is way longer than the others. Maybe cases 2003 and 2005 are the worst So 2003 and 2005 are significantly longer."

Looking at Request Additional Documents in each case: Case 2002: One Request Case 2003: Two Request Case 2005: So three Request Docs steps for 2005, which might contribute to the delay. Each Request might require customer response, causing delays. So the high number of Requests especially for high complexity cases might be a cause."

    "Text": "So the high complexity cases 2003 and 2005 are taking longer, especially 2005. Complexity level likely is a key factor. High complexity cases have more Requests, which take time, leading to longer durations. Alternatively, the number of document requests is causing delays. Case 2002: 1 Request 26h, Case 2003: 2 Requests 48h, Case 2005: 3 Requests 77h. So there's a correlation between the number of Requests and duration. So high complexity which requires more requests leads to longer times."

Alternatively, maybe the Region's processing time affects, but comparing case 2003 A and 2005 B: 2003 Region A, High: 48h vs 2005 Region B, High: 77h. So region B's high complexity case is worse. Maybe because of the number of Requests or something else. Wait, 2003 had two Requests, 2005 had three. So the number of Requests is the main driver."

But maybe the number of Requests is the main driver. So the root causes could be: High complexity claims require more document requests The number of Requests is directly proportional to duration. So the root causes are the Complexity level, leading to more document requests, which in turn cause longer lead times."

    "Text": "Additionally, maybe certain Resources handling high complexity claims might have higher demands, but it's not clear. Maybe the number of Requests is the key. Another angle: the Approve step might be delayed if there are multiple requests. But perhaps the main issue is the customer's response time, but since that's external, perhaps the process can't control that. So the root causes are the high complexity causing more requests, which require customer responses, thus extending the lead time."

Thus, the primary root causes are the Complexity causing more Requests, which add time."

The Region might play a role where in Region B, high complexity cases 2005 have more requests 3 than Region A's high complexity 2003 had 2.
