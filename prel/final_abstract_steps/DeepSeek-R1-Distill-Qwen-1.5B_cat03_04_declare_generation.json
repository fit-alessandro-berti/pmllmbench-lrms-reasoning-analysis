    "Text": "Okay, I need to construct a Python dictionary representing the DECLARE model for a manufacturing company's product design and launch process. Let's break this down step by step. First, I remember that the DECLARE model is used in Pm4py to model process flows, and it involves defining the existence and absence of activities."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The structure uses a dictionary with specific keys, each pointing to another dictionary that holds the support and confidence values for the activities and their corresponding declarative rules. The problem statement provided a detailed list of keys in the DECLARE model. I need to separate these into two parts: the existence-absence keys and the other activity keys."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "So I need to split the activity keys into these two groups. Looking at the keys provided, the first dictionary has 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', and 'init' as the keys. The corresponding value is a dictionary with activities as keys and support-confidence as values, both set to 1.0."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - IND",
    "Text": "So, for each activity in 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', and 'init', we'll have a sub-dictionary with the same structure. The second dictionary includes more activities like 'responded_existence', 'coexistence', 'response', etc., and their corresponding values. These will be another set of sub-dictionaries."

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, perhaps the activity keys are all the activities except the first four keys. Because the first group has 'existence', 'absence', etc., but perhaps those are the participation in absence of the activities. Hmm, maybe the first group is for the existence-absence, but I'm not entirely sure about the mapping."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "So, in code, I'll represent this as two dictionaries. But since the user wants the answer in a specific format, I'll have to structure it accordingly. The first dictionary (keys: 'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init') will have each activity mapped to 1.0."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - NE",
    "Text": "Wait, perhaps each activity in the second group is a key in the second dictionary, with value 1.0.
