Log B is from System B and has more details, like user IDs and resource IDs, but the timestamps are a bit off and some event names don't match exactly with Log A."

For example, 'OrderReceived' in Log B is at 9:59:58, while in Log A it's at 10:00:00. That's a difference of two seconds, which is within the 2-second tolerance I can use."
