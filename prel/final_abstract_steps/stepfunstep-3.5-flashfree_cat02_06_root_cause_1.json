    "Text": "First I need to identify cases with significantly longer resolution times. That means I should calculate the total time from Receive Ticket to Resolve Ticket for each case. Let me go through each case one by one. Case 101: Receive at 0800 Resolve at 1000 same day. Thats 2 hours. Case 102: Receive at 0805 on March 1 Resolve at 0900 on March 2. Thats over a day around 25 hours. Case 103: Receive at 0810 Resolve at 0915 same day. About 1 hour 5 minutes. Case 104: Receive at 0820 on March 1 Resolve at 0800 on March 2. Thats almost 24 hours. Case 105: Receive at 0825 on March 1 Resolve at 0900 on March 3. Thats about 48.5 hours. So cases 102 104 and 105 are the ones with significantly longer times especially 105."

    "Text": "Case 102 escalates at 1130 on March 1 then investigates at 1400 same day but Resolve is at 0900 next day. So a long gap after the first investigation. Case 104: No escalation. Assign to Level1 at 0930 then Investigate at 1300 same day then Resolve next day at 0800. So a long gap between investigation and resolution possibly overnight. Case 105: Escalates at 0910 on March 1 then next Investigate Issue is on March 2 at 1400. Thats a huge gap of over a day."

    "Text": "Wait case 104 didnt escalate but still took long. Why? Investigation started at 1300 next activity is resolve next day. So maybe Level1 agent couldnt resolve and needed more time but no escalation recorded."

    "Text": "But comparing to case 103 which was quick without escalation. So case 104s issue might be more complex requiring more time but no escalation."

    "Text": "Also looking at the timestamps activities during business hours arent continuous. For example in case 102 after escalation at 1130 investigation at 1400 then nothing until next day. Similarly case 104 investigation ends at 1300 but resolve next morning. So maybe workday boundaries cause pauses."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "The root causes seem to be: 1. Escalations introduce handoff delays especially if Level2 team has backlog or different working hours. 2. Tickets might be put on hold overnight or during nonbusiness hours leading to gaps. 3. Possibly Level1 agents not resolving quickly."
