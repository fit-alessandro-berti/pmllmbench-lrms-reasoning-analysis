So typical representation: loop node with children: first child = A (the activity before loop), second child = B (the activity inside loop). But we need to model loop where after abnormal results we go to SC etc. So we can set loop node with first child = normal path (maybe tau) and second child = the loop body (SC -> (TM XOR SPT) -> RDT)."

So we can have loop node with first child = tau (representing skip loop) and second child = loopBody. In pm4py, loop operator expects two children: first is the do part (executed before loop), second is the redo part (executed after condition). But we want to repeat loop body until normal. So we can set first child = tau (or maybe a silent step) and second child = loopBody. The loopBody is a SEQUENCE of SC, XOR(Treatment), RDT (XOR(FCE,FBA)). So loop node children: [tau, loopBody]. The loop will execute loopBody repeatedly until condition satisfied (i.e., after loopBody we go back to loop node). That's fine."
