  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "First, I need to understand the normative process described. It starts with receiving an order, then checking the inventory. If there's enough stock, the next steps are authorizing payment, packaging, shipping, and then closing the order. If there's not enough stock, after checking inventory, the process cancels the order and then closes it. The key constraints are about the order of activities: payment authorization must come after inventory check but before packaging, packaging before shipping, and shipping can't happen after a cancellation. Also, closing is always the last activity."

    "Text": "Looking at the event log, there are five cases. I'll go through each one to see if they follow the expected flow."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Case 1 looks fine. It starts with Receive, then Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. That's the standard flow when inventory is sufficient."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 2 has a problem. The activities are Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, packaging happens before authorizing payment. According to the normative process, authorization should come before packaging. So this is a violation because the payment isn't authorized yet when they started packaging, which could be risky."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 3 has another issue. After Receive, Check, Authorize, they cancel the order. But then it ships the order after cancellation, which is not allowed. The normative process says that after cancellation, you should close the order, not proceed with shipping. So shipping after cancellation is a clear violation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Case 4 seems okay. It's Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. That follows the insufficient inventory path correctly without any deviations."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Case 5 is problematic as well. It goes Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, where's the packaging step? According to the process, after authorizing payment, you should package the items before shipping. Skipping packaging might mean the items weren't properly prepared, which could lead to issues in shipping. So this is a violation because shipping happened without packaging first."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "So, summarizing, Cases 2, 3, and 5 have deviations. I need to explain each violation clearly, referencing the normative process to back up the points."
