    "Text": "**Root Cause Analysis:** 1. **Complexity**: High complexity claims require multiple iterations of document requests (2-3 times vs 0 for low), significantly extending duration. 2. **Resource Efficiency**:     - Adjuster_Lisa appears to take longer between activities compared to Adjuster_Mike. For example, in high complexity cases, Adjuster_Lisa had 3 document requests vs Adjuster_Mike's 2, and total duration was much longer (77h vs 48h).     - Adjuster_Lisa also handled the medium complexity case which took 26 hours. 3. **Regional Differences**:     - Region B's high complexity case (2005) took 77 hours vs Region A's (2003) 48 hours.     - This could indicate regional processing capacity, manager availability (Manager_Bill vs Manager_Ann), or finance department efficiency (Finance_Carl vs Finance_Alan). 4. **Process Bottlenecks**:     - The Request Additional Documents loops create significant delays, especially when multiple requests are needed.     - Approval and Payment steps also show overnight delays, suggesting batch processing or working hour limitations."

    "Text": "**Mitigation Suggestions:** 1. **Front-loading documentation**: For high complexity claims, gather more documents upfront to reduce back-and-forth. 2. **Resource training**: Review Adjuster_Lisa's performance - maybe needs training on first-time-right documentation review or better customer communication. 3. **Regional capacity balancing**: Investigate why Region B is slower - maybe workload imbalance or resource constraints. 4. **SLA for document requests**: Set time limits for customers to respond and for adjusters to review. 5. **Parallel processing**: Where possible, initiate approval preparation while waiting for documents. 6. **Automation**: Automate document validation to reduce manual review cycles."
