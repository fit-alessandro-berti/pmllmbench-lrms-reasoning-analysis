    "Text": "First, I need to understand each transcript thoroughly Each interview provides a different perspective Mary, the AP Clerk, describes the process from receiving the invoice to payment Dan, the Purchasing Officer, adds details about PO checks and internal communication Carlos, the Manager, is more about their role as the last step Rita as the supervisor handles exceptions, and Karen, the SRM, deals with indirect issues and communication with suppliers"
