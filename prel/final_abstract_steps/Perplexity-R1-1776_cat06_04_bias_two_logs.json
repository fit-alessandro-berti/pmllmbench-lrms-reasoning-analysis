The ScoreAdjustment is 0 for all except during ManualReview where it's N/A. The decisions are Approved for P001 and P003 (scores 720 and 740), Rejected for P002 (710). So in Group A, the score adjustments don't change; they use the preliminary score as is. The cutoff seems to be around 710-720. P002 with 710 gets rejected."
