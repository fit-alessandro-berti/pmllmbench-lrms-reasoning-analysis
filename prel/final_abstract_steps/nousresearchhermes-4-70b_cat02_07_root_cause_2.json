Calculate the total duration for each case (from the first event 'Submit Claim' to the last event 'Close Claim'). 2. Identify cases that take significantly longer to complete. We can set a threshold (e.g., mean + 1 standard deviation) or look for outliers. 3. Analyze the attributes (Resource, Region, Complexity) for these longer cases to find patterns."

Case 2003: Complexity: High Region: A Resources: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan. Case 2005: Complexity: High Region: B Resources: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl. Observations: 1. Complexity: The two longest cases (2003 and 2005) are High complexity, and case 2002 is Medium. 2. Region: So region B has two long cases and one short (2004). Region A has one long and one short. 3. Resources: No clear pattern without more context. 4. Also note the activity Request Additional Documents: Case 2002: 1 request, Case 2003: 2 requests, Case 2005: 3 requests."

High: 2 to 3 requests. This pattern is clear. Hypothesis 2: The number of requests for additional documents is directly related to the duration. We see: Case 2002: 1 request -> 1555 minutes Case 2003: 2 requests -> 2900 minutes Case 2005: 3 requests -> 4625 minutes. So the more requests, the longer the duration."

    "Text": "Hypothesis 3: Is there a specific region that is slower? The high complexity cases in both regions are long. Without more data, we cannot isolate region as the sole factor. Hypothesis 4: Are there specific resources that are slower? It seems that the adjuster's workload (complexity and number of requests) is the driver. Again, the complexity and number of requests per case is the main factor."

    "Text": "Conclusion: The primary root cause is the number of requests for additional documents, which is heavily influenced by the claim complexity. High complexity leads to multiple requests, and each request introduces waiting time (for the customer to respond) and then rework (reevaluation)."

    "Text": "Proposed Explanations: 1. High complexity claims require more additional documents, leading to multiple cycles and long waiting times. 2. The waiting time for customer response is a major contributor to the overall duration. Suggestions: 1. Proactively request all necessary documents at the time of submission for high complexity claims. 2. Set clear expectations with the customer about the documents needed and the time they have to respond. 3. For high complexity claims, assign a dedicated resource (case manager) to handle the communication and document collection to speed up the process."
