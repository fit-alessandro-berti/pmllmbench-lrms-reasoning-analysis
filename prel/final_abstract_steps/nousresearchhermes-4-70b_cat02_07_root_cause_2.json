Lets convert to minutes. Actually, lets compute in minutes for easier handling. Steps to compute duration: - For each case, find the minimum timestamp (Submit Claim) and the maximum timestamp (Close Claim). - Convert timestamps to datetime objects and compute the difference. Alternatively, we can note: Case 2001: from 09:00 to 10:30 on the same day -> 1.5 hours = 90 minutes. Case 2002: from 09:05 on 2024-04-01 to 11:00 on 2024-04-02 -> From 09:05 on day1 to 09:05 on day2 is 24 hours = 1440 minutes. Then from 09:05 to 11:00 on day2 is 1 hour 55 minutes = 115 minutes. Total: 1440 + 115 = 1555 minutes. Case 2003: Start: 2024-04-01 09:10 End: 2024-04-03 09:30 From 09:10 on day1 to 09:10 on day2 is 24 hours (1440 minutes). From 09:10 on day2 to 09:10 on day3 is another 24 hours (1440 minutes) -> total 2880 minutes. Then from 09:10 to 09:30 on day3 is 20 minutes. Total: 2880 + 20 = 2900 minutes. Case 2004: Start: 2024-04-01 09:20 End: 2024-04-01 10:45 Duration: 1 hour 25 minutes = 85 minutes. Case 2005: Start: 2024-04-01 09:25 End: 2024-04-04 14:30 From 09:25 on day1 to 09:25 on day2: 24 hours = 1440 minutes. Day2: 09:25 to 24:00 -> 14 hours 35 minutes = 875 minutes -> total 1440+875 = 2315 Day3: 0:00 to 24:00 -> 24*60 = 1440 minutes -> total 2315+1440=3755 Day4: 00:00 to 14:30 -> 14.5 hours = 870 minutes -> total 3755+870 = 4625 minutes. Alternatively, we can do: Start: 2024-04-01 09:25 -> convert to datetime End: 2024-04-04 14:30 -> convert to datetime Difference: 3 days and 5 hours 5 minutes? Actually: from Apr1 09:25 to Apr4 09:25 is 3 days = 3*24*60 = 4320 minutes. plus 5 hours 5 minutes = 305 minutes -> total 4625 minutes. Now, lets list the durations: Case 2001: 90 minutes Case 2002: 1555 minutes Case 2003: 2900 minutes Case 2004: 85 minutes Case 2005: 4625 minutes"

Complexity: - The two longest cases (2003 and 2005) are High complexity, and case 2002 is Medium. - The two shortest (2001 and 2004) are Low complexity. 2. Region: - Case 2002 (B) and 2005 (B) are in region B, and 2003 (A) is in region A. - So region B has two long cases and one short (2004). Region A has one long and one short. 3. Resources: - For Adjusters: Case 2002: Adjuster_Lisa -> long Case 2003: Adjuster_Mike -> long Case 2005: Adjuster_Lisa -> long Case 2001: Adjuster_Mike -> short Case 2004: Adjuster_Lisa -> short - For Managers: Case 2002: Manager_Ann -> long Case 2003: Manager_Bill -> long Case 2005: Manager_Bill -> long Case 2001: Manager_Ann -> short Case 2004: Manager_Ann -> short - For Finance: Case 2002: Finance_Carl -> long Case 2003: Finance_Alan -> long Case 2005: Finance_Carl -> long Case 2001: Finance_Alan -> short Case 2004: Finance_Carl -> short 4.

    "Text": "Now, lets try to find patterns: Hypothesis 1: High complexity cases require more requests for additional documents, which leads to longer durations. Indeed: Low complexity: 0 requests (cases 2001, 2004) Medium: 1 request (case 2002) High: 2 to 3 requests (cases 2003, 2005) This pattern is clear. Hypothesis 2: The number of requests for additional documents is directly related to the duration. We see: Case 2002: 1 request -> 1555 minutes Case 2003: 2 requests -> 2900 minutes Case 2005: 3 requests -> 4625 minutes So the more requests, the longer the duration. Why might that be? Each request for additional documents adds a cycle: waiting for the customer, then re-evaluation. This can cause significant delays."

The medium in B is long, and the low in B is short. However, the long cases in region A (case 2003) and B (cases 2002 and 2005) are also tied to complexity and the requests. Without more data, we cannot isolate region as the sole factor. But note that region B has a high complexity case (2005) that is the longest."

Managers: Ann: case 2001: short case 2002: long case 2004: short Bill: case 2003: long case 2005: long Again, the complexity and number of requests per case is the main factor.

    "Text": "Conclusion: The primary root cause is the number of requests for additional documents, which is heavily influenced by the claim complexity. High complexity leads to multiple requests, and each request introduces waiting time (for the customer to respond) and then rework (reevaluation). Additional observations from the log: For case 2003 (High, Region A): After the first request (at 11:00 on day1), the next request is at 17:00 on the same day? Wait, the first request was at 11:00, then it records another request at 17:00 on the same day? This might indicate that the customer responded quickly but still more documents were needed? Or perhaps the adjuster found more issues after the first set of documents? Then the approval is on day2 at 16:00 and payment on day3 at 09:00. For case 2005 (High, Region B): First request: 2024-04-01 11:30 Then: 2024-04-02 17:00 -> thats almost a full day later (from 11:30 to 17:00 next day? Actually, from Apr1 11:30 to Apr2 17:00 is 29.5 hours) Then: 2024-04-03 15:00 -> another 22 hours? Then approval: 2024-04-04 10:00 -> about 19 hours later. The delays between requests are long (likely waiting for customer response). Proposed Explanations: 1. High complexity claims require more additional documents, leading to multiple cycles and long waiting times. 2. The waiting time for customer response is a major contributor to the overall duration. Suggestions: 1. Proactively request all necessary documents at the time of submission for high complexity claims. This can be done by having a detailed checklist for different claim types. 2. Set clear expectations with the customer about the documents needed and the time they have to respond. Maybe even set a deadline and follow up promptly. 3. For high complexity claims, assign a dedicated resource (case manager) to handle the communication and document collection to speed up the process. 4. Monitor the time taken for customer response and if it exceeds a threshold, escalate to a senior adjuster or send reminders. 5. Analyze the types of documents frequently requested and ensure that the initial submission form captures as much as possible. 6. For region-specific performance: Case 2005 (Region B, High) took the longest. It might be that Region B has fewer resources or higher workload? We see that Adjuster_Lisa handled two high/medium cases (2002 and 2005) on the same day? But note that case 2005 started at 09:25 and case 2002 at 09:05 on the same day. However, case 2002 didnt have a request until 14:00, so its possible. But then case 2005 had a request at 11:30 and then the next day at 17:00. We dont have data on the workload of each resource. But it might be that adjusters in Region B are overloaded? Suggestion: - Balance the workload among adjusters, especially in Region B. - Consider transferring some cases to Region A if they have capacity. 7. For resources: Manager_Bill handled the two longest cases (2003 and 2005). Maybe he is slower? Or maybe he is assigned to high complexity cases by design? We see that Manager_Ann handled both low complexity cases and one medium (which was long) and Manager_Bill handled two high. Since the long cases are due to many requests, it might be that Manager_Bill is assigned to the most complex cases. Suggestion: - Provide additional training or support to adjusters and managers handling high complexity cases. - Consider having a specialized team for high complexity claims."

Therefore, the root cause of long case durations is primarily the number of requests for additional documents, which is driven by claim complexity. The other attributes (Region, Resource) do not show a consistent pattern without considering complexity and requests."
