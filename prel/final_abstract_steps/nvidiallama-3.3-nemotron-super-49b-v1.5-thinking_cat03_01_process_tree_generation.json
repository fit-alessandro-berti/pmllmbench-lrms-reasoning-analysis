    "Text": "Okay lets tackle this problem step by step The user wants me to construct a process tree based on the detailed hospital patient management scenario provided The process tree needs to use the operators sequence exclusive choice parallel and loop along with the specified activities First I need to break down the process into the stages described and map each part to the appropriate operators Let me start by listing all the activities and their order as per the description 1 Arrival A is the first step Then Registration RG and Intake Assessment IA follow in sequence So the initial part is A RG IA But wait the first point says the patient begins by Arriving then must complete Registration then Intake Assessment So thats a sequence A RG IA 2 After the intake assessment the patient must be evaluated by the triage team This involves two mandatory activities in sequence Triage Interview TI and Triage Classification TC So thats another sequence TI TC So the next part after IA is TI TC 3 Based on TC there is an exclusive decision on the type of initial diagnostic tests If the patient is suspected of a cardiovascular issue they perform a Comprehensive ECG CE Otherwise if suspicion is more general or non cardiac they perform a Full Blood Panel FBP Only one of these tests CE or FBP will be performed as the initial diagnostic procedure So this is an X operator X CE FBP"
