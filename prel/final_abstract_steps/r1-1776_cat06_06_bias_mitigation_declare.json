Coexistence Constraints: Ensure that if certain decisions involving sensitive attributes are made (e.g., Approve/Reject) after checking attributes like race/gender/age then ManualReview coexists.

Coexistence would require that whenever one occurs in the trace, so does the other."

Perhaps adding coexistence between ManualReview and each of these decision steps when they follow certain checks. Alternatively: Since we cant conditionally apply coexistence based on preceding events in DECLARE unless modeled through binary constraints. Wait no—coexistence applies globally regardless of order. So another approach is if certain decisions can only happen if ManualReview also exists in the same trace."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So add coexistence between Approve/Reject/RequestAdditionalInfo etc., and ManualReview. But according to problem statement examples: The user suggests adding coexistence such as requiring that any decision involving sensitive demographics requires ManualReview. So suppose when theres an activity called Approve which could be influenced by race/gender/etc., we want it coexisting with ManualReview. Therefore: Add under coexistence: Approve: ManualReview: ..., Reject: ManualReview: ..., But wait coexistence requires mutual presence—so every time Approve occurs in trace, ManualReview must also occur; every time ManualReview occurs Approve doesnt have to occur unless specified otherwise? Wait no—coexistence(A,B) means if A occurs then B must occur somewhere in trace AND vice versa. Wait DECLAREs coexistence(A,B) means both A requires Bs presence and B requires As presence. So requiring Approve ManualReview might not make sense unless every approval needs manual review even outside of bias contexts. Hmm so maybe instead create specific versions of approve/reject linked with demographic checks? Like ApproveAfterMinorityCheck but again these may not exist in current model. Alternatively focus on ensuring that whenever certain checks happen (like checking race/gender/age), manual review coexists. So for each of those checks: Add under coexistence: CheckApplicantRace: ManualReview: ..., CheckApplicantAge: ManualReview: ..., ..."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "This way whenever race is checked manual review must also occur elsewhere in trace. 2 Response Constraints: Ensure that after checking race/gender/etc., eventually perform bias mitigation before proceeding. For example: For each check activity C (Check...), add response(C BiasMitigationCheck). So under response: C: BiasMitigationCheck: ... Which means every time C happens eventually BMC happens. 3 Precedence Constraints: Before making certain decisions following BMC. For instance: precedence(BiasMitigationCheck, Approve) meaning approve cannot happen unless BMC happened before. Similarly for other decisions. 4 Non-Succession Constraints: Prevent direct succession from check activity decision. Add under nonsuccession or nonchainsuccession. For nonsuccession(A,B): If A happens at any point B cannot happen later anywhere. Thats too strong because it forbids B entirely once A happens. Nonchainsuccession(A,B): If A occurs at some point t1 then B cannot occur at t2 = t1 + 1. This prevents immediate succession but allows later occurrence. So adding nonchainsuccession from each check activity C (C) each decision D (Approve, Reject). So under nonchainsuccession: C: {D: {support...} }, etc."

    "Text": "Now putting all together into code. Let me outline possible new entries: Assuming new activities introduced: Activities related to checking attributes: CheckApplicantAge CheckApplicantGender CheckApplicantRace Activities related to mitigation: ManualReview BiasMitigationCheck Decisions: Approve Reject Now updating declare_model: Under coexistence: Add entries for each check activity requiring manual review: coexistence: { ..., Approve: { ManualReview: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1 .0} }, Reject: { ManualReview: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1 .0} }, FinalDecision: {ManualReview: ...}, // but maybe not needed }, Wait but according to problem statement examples they mention FinalDecision as part of existing model—perhaps FinalDecision represents approve/rejects? Then maybe splitting into separate steps would help but given time constraints assume existing entries use FinalDecision as generic step."

  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - IND",
    "Text": "Wait but original declare_model has existence of FinalDecision which may encompass approval/rejection actions. This complicates things because we need specific steps linked with biases. Alternatively assume that Approve and Reject are separate activities added into declare_model. Given this confusion due to sample code being simplified but real answer needing hypothetical entries—perhaps proceed assuming necessary activities exist even if not present initially. Thus: Adding under coexistence: For all demographic checks: coexistence : { ..., Approve : { ManualReview : { support : 1.0 , confidence : 1 .0 } }, Reject : { ManualReview : ... }, ..., }, Additionally for demographic checks requiring manual review coexists whenever theyre checked: e.g., coexistence : { ..., Check Applicant Race : { ManualReview : ... }, same for Age/Gender, } Then under response: After each demographic check comes BMC: Under response: For each C [Checks], add C BMC response = { ..., Check Applicant Race : { Bias MitigationCheck : ... }, same for Age/Gender, } Under precedence: Ensure BMC precedes approve/reject: precedence = { ..., Bias MitigationCheck : { Approve : ..., Reject : ..., } } Under nonchainsuccession: Prevent immediate succession from C approve/reject: nonchainsuccession = { ..., Check Applicant Race : { Approve : ..., Reject : ..., }, same for Age/Gender, } Similarly chainresponse could enforce BMC right after C: chainresponse = { } But chainresponse would enforce immediate following—so chainresponse[C] = BMC means every time C happens next action is BMC. This ensures no immediate action except BMC follows C. That could prevent immediate approvals/rejects after checking demographics without mitigation first. Putting all together into code format. Now document rationale. Each added constraint serves as follows: Coexistence between Approve/Reject and ManualReview ensures whenever such decisions occur manual review exists too—preventing unverified biased outcomes. Coexistence between demographic checks and manual review ensures when such factors are considered manual review is required. Response from demographic checksBMC ensures mitigation step eventually happens after checking demographics. Chainprecedence ensures BMC precedes approvals/rejects thus requiring mitigation before finalizing decisions. Non-chain-succession prevents direct from demographic checkdecision without intermediate steps. Now writing code accordingly within Python dictionary structure. For example declare_model[coexistence][Approve] = {ManualReview: {support: 1...}} Similarly for others. Note replacing spaces here due typos but code needs correct syntax. Final code will look something like this declare_model = { ...existing entries... # Added Coexistence constraints # Ensure decisions require manual review # And demographic checks require manual review # And demographic checks require bias mitigation } Rationale explanations will state how these additions prevent biased outcomes by enforcing mandatory reviews and mitigation steps when dealing with sensitive data."
