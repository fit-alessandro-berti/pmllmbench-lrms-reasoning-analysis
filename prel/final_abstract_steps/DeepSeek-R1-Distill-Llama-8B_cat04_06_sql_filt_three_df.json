    "Text": "The problem is about filtering events from a table called `event_log`. The table has columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. The goal is to exclude events from cases that meet certain criteria: the sequence of 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', 'Confirm Order' followed by a time condition."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The activities must occur in exact order without interruptions, meaning strict consecutive ordering. To identify this, I deduced I would eventually need to look at temporal ordering and possibly calculate time differences between certain activities."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Initially, I hypothesized that a combination of window functions or self-joins could solve this problem by tracking activity sequences and timestamp calculations."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "An alternative approach to explore was using recursive queries or a series of logical checks to implement the sequence condition manually. I brainstormed that this might simplify cases when considering large tables."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Backtracking - NE",
    "Text": "Several attempts using subqueries and window functions immediately ran into challenges, as I thought about edge cases where sequences might appear in non-terminal positions or how to check multiple rows simultaneously. I then started considering other SQL constructs and backtracked to alternative hypothesis formulations."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - NE",
    "Text": "During validation of a possible SQL solution, I struggled to confirm if the query would handle edge cases, e.g., whether timestamps and sequences aligned correctly or if exclusions had unintended behavior. This lowered confidence in the correctness of the query."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - NE",
    "Text": "I reasoned that the eventual exclusion of cases could be handled by writing several nested subqueries, but implementation complexities left room for potential errors. The surrounding reasoning slipped into speculative areas to patch unknowns."
