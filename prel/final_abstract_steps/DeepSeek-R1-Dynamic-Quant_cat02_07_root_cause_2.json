Case 2002 starts April 1st, but the close is on April 2nd at 11:00. From start to finish, it's over two days, maybe around 26-27 hours? But considering there was a Request Additional Documents that might have caused some delay between steps. Case 2003 starts April 1st and closes on April 3rd at 9:30 AM. Thats like two full days plus a bit. So about two and a half days. There are multiple requests for additional documents here, which probably added time. Case 2004 is closed the same day as welllike within an hour or so from start to finish. Quick processing again. Case 2005 starts on April 1st but closes on April 4th at 14:30. So three days and a bit more? That seems like a long time, especially since there are multiple document requests here too."

Resource Inefficiency: Adjuster_Lisa might be handling too many cases or struggling with high-complexity claims, leading delays in processing (multiple doc requests). Manager_Bill's approval steps take longer than others. 3. Region B perhaps has some issues when combined with certain resources and complexities."

Bottleneck at Adjuster_Lisa: ) Maybe Lisa is overloaded. Balancing workload among adjusters could help, especially for high-complexity cases. Manager_Bill's approval delays: Investigate why Bill takes longer training or delegation to other managers. Additional possible cause: The repeated document requests might indicate poor communication with clients, leading multiple follow-ups. Improving initial documentation requirements clarity could reduce back-and-forth."
