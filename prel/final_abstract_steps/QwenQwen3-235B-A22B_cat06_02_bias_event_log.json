C001 and C004 which are part of the community group had their scores adjusted up. But C003 didnt get any adjustment and was rejected. However C002 had a preliminary score of 720 same as C001s adjusted score and was approved. C003s 715 is lower than 720 so maybe the threshold for approval is 720. If thats the case then the community group adjustment could push some applicants over the threshold who otherwise wouldnt be approved."

Wait the FinalDecision for C004 is Approved even though the adjusted score is 700? That contradicts the idea that 720 is the threshold. Maybe the threshold is lower? Let me check other cases. C005 has a score of 740 and is approved. C002 has 720 and approved. C004 has 700 and approved. C001 has 720 and approved. C003 has 715 and rejected.

But how does a 700 get approved while 715 is rejected? That suggests that the score isnt the only factor. Maybe the community group affiliation affects the decision beyond the score adjustment. Because C004 is part of the community group and LocalResident TRUE even with a lower adjusted score they might be favored. Whereas C003 isnt part of any group so even with a higher score than C004s original its rejected."

If the decision was purely based on the score then C003 should be approved. But since they dont have a community group they didnt get the adjustment but their score was already higher than C004s adjusted score. Unless the adjustment is applied first then the decision is made. Let me check C004s PreliminaryScore is 690. Then +10 adjustment to 700. Then ManualReview happens and FinalDecision is Approved. C003s PreliminaryScore is 715 no adjustment since no community group so remains 715. Then ManualReview and FinalDecision is Rejected. So even though 715 > 700 the C004 is approved and C003 rejected. That suggests that the adjustment isnt the only factor. Maybe the community group affiliation or being a LocalResident is influencing the ManualReview decision."

Also the fact that the ScoreAdjustment is only given to those in a community group like Highland Civic Darts Club could be a source of bias. If being in a community group is a proxy for something else like socioeconomic status or geographic location then people not in those groups maybe lower income or different areas are disadvantaged."

Meanwhile C003 with 715 higher than 700 was rejected. This suggests that the adjustment and other factors related to community affiliation are influencing the decision more than the actual creditworthiness as measured by the score."

This could perpetuate inequities by favoring certain geographic or community groups over others regardless of individual merit. Additionally the ManualReview step might be subjective allowing personal biases of the reviewer to impact the decision especially if reviewers are more sympathetic to applicants from their own community groups."
