Branch A Sufficient Inventory: Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Authorize Payment -> Package Items -> Ship Order -> Close Order. Constraints: Authorize payment after Check inventory and before Package items. Package items after Authorize payment and before Ship order. Ship order after Package items. Close order at the end. Branch B Insufficient Inventory: Sequence: Receive -> Check -> Cancel Order -> Close Order. Constraints: No fulfillment activities packaging shipping after cancellation. Cancel order happens after Check inventory. Close order at the end. General Rules: Ship order should never occur after a cancellation. Authorize payment before Check inventory is a violation. Package items before Authorize payment is a violation. Close order is the final activity."

Case 2 has: Package items -> Authorize payment. Text quote: authorizing payment before packaging would be considered a violation AND Package items should only occur after authorization.

Comparison: The process hits Authorize payment, suggesting inventory was sufficient or at least, they proceeded as if it were. Then Cancel order occurs. The normative process says cancellation happens directly after checking inventory if stock is insufficient. Wait, the text says: If the inventory check reveals that there is not enough stock to fulfill the order, the process should directly proceed to Cancel order. Does authorizing payment before cancelling violate the rule? Scenario 1: Inventory was sufficient -> Proceed to Auth Payment. Then something happened maybe payment failed, maybe customer changed mind. The text doesnt explicitly handle Payment failure or Cancellation after authorization. It defines two paths: Good Inventory Auth -> Package and Bad Inventory Cancel."

Text quote: Ship order should never after a cancellation AND it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment such as packaging or shipping. Result: Violation. Shipping occurred after cancellation. This is explicitly forbidden. The order was cancelled, but then shipped. This is the primary and undeniable violation. The intermediate step of Authorize -> Cancel is ambiguous maybe payment failed, but Shipping after Cancel is strictly forbidden."

The text says: If the inventory is found to be sufficient normal progression Authorize payment. The text says: If inventory not enough directly proceed to Cancel order. Strictly speaking, if you Authorize Payment, you are on the Sufficient Inventory path. If you then Cancel, you are deviating from the standard description... However, the major violation is Ship after Cancel."

Case 2 has Package before Auth. The text explicitly calls out packaging items before authorization as a violation. Case 3 has Ship after Cancel. Text explicitly calls out shipping after cancellation as a violation. Case 5 has Ship without Package. Text says Ship order should only occur after packaging. Conclusion looks solid. Self-Correction during drafting: For Case 3, there is a nuance... the text does explicitly forbid Shipping after Cancellation. That is the safest violation to cite... Lets stick to the Key Constraints section... These are explicitly stated in the text as violations."
