For example, if during the application review process an activity like CheckApplicantRace happens, then it might lead directly to a decision without proper checks. That's bad because it could result in biased decisions against certain races."

For example, if there's a FinalDecision_Reject_Minority (assuming the model has these activities), then it should coexist with ManualReview."
