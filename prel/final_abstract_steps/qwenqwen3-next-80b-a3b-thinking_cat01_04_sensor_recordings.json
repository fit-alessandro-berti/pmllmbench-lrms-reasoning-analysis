Because welding usually involves high heat, maybe high vibration? But welding might have high temp and maybe high energy. But flow is zero, which makes sense if its not moving material but welding something in place."

Maybe welding? Alternatively, maybe Events 4-6 is cutting, then Events 7-8 is a finishing step. Like deburring. But deburring might have similar vibration to cutting. Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the cutting is happening in Events 4-6, then Events 7-8 is a different step. Maybe a cooling step? But Events 7-8 temp is 40, which is lower than Events 4-6s 50-58.

Flow rate 2, tool pos 15. Maybe a different operation. If the tool is at 15, maybe preparing for welding. Or maybe a cleaning step. But not sure. Alternatively, maybe its part of the cutting process. But why would temp drop to 40? If its a cutting operation, maybe the tool is moving slower, but temp would still be high. Hmm."

Alternatively, maybe during Events 7-8. Quality inspection might involve specific sensor readings. For example, maybe during inspection, the machine stops moving, but sensors are active.
