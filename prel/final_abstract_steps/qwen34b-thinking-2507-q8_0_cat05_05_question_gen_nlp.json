    "Text": "First, I need to understand what makes a question thought-provoking and open-ended in this context. The questions shouldn't have simple yes/no answers - they should invite deep analysis, critical thinking, and exploration of trade-offs. Since this is for a supply chain process with so many moving parts (multiple countries, different regulations, tech elements), I should focus on areas where complexities intersect: sustainability, risk management, technology integration, human factors, regulatory challenges, and strategic decisions."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Hmm... looking at the process description, I can identify several key phases where questions could emerge: - R&D and component sourcing (Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, US suppliers) - Manufacturing in Malaysia (24/7 shifts) - Logistics across global transport modes - Regional distribution strategies (just-in-time vs aggregated shipments) - End-to-consumer delivery with special cases (VIPs, recalls) - Digital systems and analytics - Compliance with multiple regulations"

    "Text": "I should avoid questions that are too narrow or too obvious. For example, What is the lead time for components? would be too basic. Instead, I want questions that make someone think about implications - like how a supplier change in one region affects the whole chain, or what happens if a regulatory change in one country cascades."

    "Text": "The user emphasized discovering more insights, potential issues, strategies for improvement, and implications of various decisions. So each question should serve one of these purposes. I'll try to cover different angles: - Risk exposure (geopolitical, natural disasters) - Sustainability trade-offs (carbon footprint vs speed) - Technology's role (AI predictions vs real-world constraints) - Human elements (worker conditions in assembly plants) - Strategic decisions (when to use JIT vs bulk shipping)"

    "Text": "Let me brainstorm some questions first: 1. How might a geopolitical event (like a Taiwan semiconductor shortage) disrupt the entire chain beyond just component availability? 2. If the company switched to 100% recycled materials, would that increase costs more than the environmental benefits justify? 3. Could AI-driven demand forecasting prevent stockouts in high-demand markets while avoiding overstock in slower-moving ones? 4. What happens if a major logistics partner in Europe gets disrupted during customs clearance? 5. How would a sudden change in labor regulations in Malaysia affect production schedules?"
