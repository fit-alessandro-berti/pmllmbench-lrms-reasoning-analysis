    "Text": "Hmm wait maybe theres a difference here The standard is a linear path except for possible loops Wait but looking at model2 loop onboarding is a loop including Onboard skip which perhaps loops back or the loop is Between Onboard and skip maybe allowing multiple passes Let me see xor payroll is a XOR between Payroll and skip so on workaround perhaps to bypass certain steps if needed So loop onboarding allows repeating Onboard and skip again So if Onboard is done then you can go back to Onboard again then do xor payroll which connects payroll and skip again Maybe thats for error checking or alternative paths but complicates the process This loop introduces a possible redundancy or unexpected path Maybe thats an anomaly The standard process might not have such a loop as loops are there for necessity but in standard Hire to Retire maybe loops are not common except for specific cases"

    "Text": "Looking at model1s order edges the flow from Onboard to Payroll Close That seems okay Anomalies in model1 perhaps the absence of the loop onboarding Because in model2 theres a loop which might be unnecessary Alternatively is there another anomaly Alternatively maybe the sequence is correct except for something else Wait model2 has a loop onboarding loop the xor payroll makes some combination which might be unnecessary perhaps taxing for employees unnecessarily or making it possible to cancel steps Another possible anomaly in model2 is the introduction of XOR between payroll and skip That might be non standard Because payroll requires processing employees so maybe XOR could mean either payroll completed or skip considered But perhaps the XOR is not typical The original process might not have such a condition"

    "Text": "Breaking it down the anomalies are deviations from standard In model1 maybe they have all standard steps Model2 has loops loop onboarding loop the xor payroll which are anomalies So the anomalies in model1 none Or maybe the loop onboarding is okay Alternatively maybe model1 is standard Wait the question says each has anomalies So perhaps model1 could be correct except the proper use of transitions Alternatively in model1 perhaps skipping move from screen to decide directly after screen Like maybe the standard requires screendecide first which its done Hmm perhaps the key anomalies are model2 introducing a loop unnecessary and the XOR Thus standard process might not have loops unless necessary and in model1 its okay Therefore maybe model1 is less anomalous Thus after analyzing model1 may align better with standard norms implying that model2 has more severe anomalies introducing possible inefficiencies So the answer would pick model1 as closer to normative since it has fewer anomalies So finalizing model1 is standard doesnt have major anomalies model2 has loop and XOR which are deviations making it less normal Thus model1 aligns better so explain why standard path requires linear progression without loops redundancies"
