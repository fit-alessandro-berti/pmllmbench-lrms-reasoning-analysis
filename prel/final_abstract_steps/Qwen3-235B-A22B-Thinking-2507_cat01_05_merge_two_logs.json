Log A is from System A, which is considered the primary timeline but might have timestamps that reflect when events were received rather than when they actually started. It has basic info: timestamp, event type, and order ID. Log B is from System B, which has richer attributes like user_id, resource_id, and notes, but timestamps might be slightly off and event names differ."

Maybe the actual payment event happened around the same time but Log B recorded it later due to system delay? I should probably not force a match if it is over tolerance. But 5 seconds is close - maybe I should check if there are other events around that time. Log A has no other payment events, Log B has no other payment events. It is likely the same event despite the 5-second gap."

It says e.g. so 2 seconds is an example, but perhaps I can use a bit more flexibility? The problem states slightly offset by a few seconds or milliseconds so maybe 5 seconds is acceptable. I'll assume that for payment, since it is the only candidate, and the difference is small in the context of order processing, I can match them."
