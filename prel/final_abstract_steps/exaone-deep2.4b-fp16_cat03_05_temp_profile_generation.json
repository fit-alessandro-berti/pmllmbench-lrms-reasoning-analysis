But maybe the main factor is the time between selecting the supplier and placing the order. Lets say the average time is a few hours, but since supply chain can be slow, maybe longer. However, since its a subset, maybe a moderate value. Lets say average 8 hours, standard deviation 2 hours?"

    "Text": "Another pair: OP RC. Order placed, receiving components. The lead time here would be the time from placing the order to receiving at the warehouse. This could depend on supplier lead times, warehouse inventory levels, etc. Suppose the average is around a day (24 hours), but maybe 36 hours? Lets say 36 hours average, SD of 6 hours? But maybe the SD is higher because of uncertainties in lead times. Alternatively, if the order is placed immediately after OP, but the receiving might take a few hours. Hmm, perhaps 6 hours average with 3-hour SD? Not sure. Alternatively, maybe the average is 12 hours, SD 4 hours. Maybe better to pick numbers that are reasonable for a supply chain process."

However, the problem says each pair of activities that appear in the event logs, so perhaps all possible pairs where one follows the other in any trace.
