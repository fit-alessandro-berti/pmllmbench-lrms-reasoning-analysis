The hiring process has several stages: resume parsing with a loop for data completeness, skill assessment, then an XOR choice for cultural fit check. The XOR branch can lead to either a standard cultural fit evaluation or a CommunityAffiliationCheck that gives a subtle advantage. Then there's a managerial review and final decision."

The presence of this XOR branch introduces the bias because the latter gives an advantage to certain applicants."

In POWL terms, the loop would be an OperatorPOWL with LOOP operator. The XOR choice is an OperatorPOWL with XOR operator. The standard cultural fit check and CommunityAffiliationCheck are separate transitions. The managerial review and final decision are transitions as well."

If the resume is incomplete, the applicant is asked to provide more info (RequestMoreInfo), which loops back to ResumeParsing. So the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo... This might require a loop between the DataCompletenessCheck and RequestMoreInfo? Or perhaps the loop is part of the DataCompletenessCheck... Let's assume that the loop is between ResumeParsing and RequestMoreInfo... This is getting a bit complicated... Let me think again."

So the nodes are: Loop (OperatorPOWL with LOOP and children RequestMoreInfo, ResumeParsing), SkillAssessment (Transition), XOR (OperatorPOWL with XOR and children StandardCulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck), ManagerialReview (Transition), FinalDecision (Transition).
