The supply chain is multinational, involves multiple components from different countries, assembly in Malaysia, distribution to various regions, and uses digital systems for tracking and analytics."

    "Text": "I need to make sure the questions are open-ended, not yes/no. They should encourage deeper thinking. Let me check if I have 20. Let me list them out and see if they cover various aspects without repetition. Wait, I need to ensure each question is unique and covers different parts of the process. Let me count. Once I have 20, I can finalize them. Let me make sure they are thought-provoking and not too technical. Avoid SQL, focus on strategies, issues, and implications. Alright, I think thats covered."
