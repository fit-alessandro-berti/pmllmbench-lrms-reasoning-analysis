    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, I need to check each case in the event log against the normative process description and see which ones deviate. Let me first re-read the normative process to make sure I understand the correct flow. The normative process says: - Start with Receive order. - Then Check inventory must happen before any payment authorization or fulfillment steps. - If inventory is sufficient: - After Check, Authorize Payment, then Package items, then Ship order, then Close order. - If inventory is insufficient: - After Check, Cancel order, then Close order. Key constraints: - Authorize payment must come after Check inventory and before Package items. - Package items must come after Authorize payment and before Ship order. - Ship order must come after Package items and never after Cancel. - Close order must be the final activity."

    "Text": "Case 2: Receive Check Package Authorize Ship Close. Wait, here Package items comes before Authorize payment. According to the normative description, after Check inventory, if sufficient, you need to Authorize payment before Packaging. Because Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping. So in this case, Package is before Authorize. That's a violation. Because you can't package before payment is authorized. So Case 2 violates the rule."

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close. Wait, after Check inventory, they Authorize payment, then Cancel order. But according to the description, if inventory is sufficient, you proceed with payment, etc. If inventory is insufficient, you cancel. ... So if the Check shows insufficient, then Cancel should follow. But if Check shows sufficient, then you proceed to Authorize payment. However, in this case, after Check, they Authorized payment, then Cancel. That seems conflicting. ... So in Case 3, after Check, they authorized payment (so assuming inventory was okay), but then canceled. That's a violation. Because once payment is authorized, the process should proceed to package, not cancel. ... Also, after Cancel, they Ship order. Which is not allowed because shipping after cancel is invalid. ... So that's two violations: Cancel after Authorize ..., and then Ship after Cancel. So definitely a violation."

    "Text": "Case 5: Receive Check Authorize Ship Close. Wait, here after Authorize payment, they go straight to Ship order, skipping Package items. Because the normative process says after Authorize, you need to Package items before Ship. So Package items should come between Authorize and Ship. So in this case, they skipped Package items. So that's a violation. Because you can't ship without packaging. The description says Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with Ship order."

    "Text": "So let's list all cases: Case 1: Correct. Case 2: Package before Authorize. Violation. Case 3: After Check, Authorize, then Cancel (which shouldn't happen if inventory was sufficient), then Ship after Cancel. Also, after Cancel, they should Close, but they Ship after Cancel. So multiple issues. Case 4: Correct. Case 5: Missing Package items between Authorize and Ship. So violation. So the violating cases are 2, 3, 5."
