According to the normative description, after Check inventory, if sufficient, you need to Authorize payment before Packaging.

    "Text": "Case 3: Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close. Wait, after Check inventory, they Authorize payment, then Cancel order. But according to the description, if inventory is sufficient, you proceed with payment, etc. If inventory is insufficient, you cancel. But here, they checked inventory, authorized payment (so assuming inventory was sufficient), then canceled. Wait, but if inventory was sufficient, why cancel? Or maybe the Check inventory showed insufficient, but they still authorized payment? Wait, but according to the description, after Check inventory, if insufficient, you go directly to Cancel. So if the Check shows sufficient, then you proceed to Authorize payment. However, in this case, after Check, they Authorized payment, then Cancel. That seems conflicting. Because if inventory was sufficient, why cancel? But maybe the Check inventory was done, then they authorized payment, but then found out something else? Wait, the description says if inventory is found to be sufficient, then normal progression... if not enough stock, then cancel. So the Check inventory steps result determines the path. So if Check shows sufficient, you go to Authorize payment. If insufficient, you go to Cancel. So in Case 3: after Check, they did Authorize payment (so presumably inventory was sufficient), but then they Cancel order. But why would you cancel after payment is authorized? That doesnt make sense. Because once payment is authorized, you should proceed to package and ship. Unless theres a problem after payment authorization, but according to the normative process, the only branching is based on inventory check. So perhaps the process shouldnt allow Cancel after Authorize payment. Because according to the description, after Check, if sufficient, you go to Authorize, then Package, Ship, Close. If insufficient, Check Cancel Close. So Cancel should only happen right after Check inventory if insufficient. But in this case, they did Check Authorize Cancel. Thats a problem. Because after Authorize payment, you shouldnt cancel. Unless theres a separate step where after payment authorization, something goes wrong, but the normative description doesnt mention that. The description says if the inventory check reveals not enough stock, then cancel. So the cancellation path is only after Check inventory, not after payment authorization. So in Case 3, after Check, they authorized payment (so assuming inventory was okay), but then canceled. Thats a violation. Because once payment is authorized, the process should proceed to package, not cancel. Alternatively, maybe the Check inventory showed insufficient, but they still authorized payment? But that would be wrong. Because if inventory is insufficient, you shouldnt authorize payment. So the Check inventory must come before Authorize payment, and the result of Check determines whether to proceed to payment or cancel. So in Case 3, after Check, they did Authorize payment, which would imply that inventory was sufficient, but then they canceled. But why would you cancel after payment is authorized? Thats a problem. So this is a violation. Also, after Cancel, they Ship order. Which is not allowed because shipping after cancel is invalid. Because once canceled, you shouldnt ship. So the sequence Check Authorize Cancel Ship is bad. Because after Cancel, you should Close, but here they Ship after Cancel. So thats two violations: Cancel after Authorize (since if inventory was sufficient, you shouldnt cancel; if insufficient, you shouldnt authorize payment first), and then Ship after Cancel. So definitely a violation."

    "Text": "Case 5: Receive Check Authorize Ship Close. Wait, here after Authorize payment, they go straight to Ship order, skipping Package items. Because the normative process says after Authorize, you need to Package items before Ship. So Package items should come between Authorize and Ship. So in this case, they skipped Package items. So thats a violation. Because you cant ship without packaging. The description says Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with Ship order. So Case 5 has Authorize Ship, missing Package. So thats a problem."

    "Text": "So lets list all cases: Case 1: Correct. Case 2: Package before Authorize. Violation. Case 3: After Check, Authorize, then Cancel (which shouldnt happen if inventory was sufficient), then Ship after Cancel. Also, after Cancel, they should Close, but they Ship after Cancel. So multiple issues. Case 4: Correct. Case 5: Missing Package items between Authorize and Ship. So violation. Wait, but lets check Case 5 again. The sequence is Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. So yes, Ship comes after Authorize, but before Package. Wait no, in the table for Case 5: Case ID 5: Receive order Check inventory Authorize payment Ship order Close order So yes, after Authorize payment, Ship order happens, but theres no Package items activity. So Package is missing. So the process requires that after Authorize, you Package, then Ship. So skipping Package is a violation. Now, Case 3: Case 3: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. So after Cancel, they Ship. Which is invalid. Also, Cancel should come after Check if inventory is insufficient. But here, after Check, they Authorize payment (so assuming inventory was sufficient), but then Cancel. But why cancel after payment is authorized? Thats inconsistent. Because the process flow for sufficient inventory would not have a Cancel step. So the Check inventory steps result should dictate whether to proceed to payment or cancel. So if Check shows sufficient, then Authorize payment is next. If insufficient, then Cancel. So in this case, if Check was done and they proceeded to Authorize payment, that implies inventory was sufficient. But then Cancel is done after that. Which shouldnt happen. So the Cancel step should only be after Check inventory, not after Authorize. So the correct path for insufficient is Check Cancel. For sufficient, Check Authorize. So having Cancel after Authorize is a problem. Also, after Cancel, Ship is not allowed. So two violations here. Case 2: Package before Authorize. So Package items before payment authorization. Which violates the rule that Package must come after Authorize. So thats a violation. So which cases are violating? Case 2: yes. Case 3: yes. Case 5: yes. Case 1 and 4 are okay. Wait, lets check Case 4 again. Case 4: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. Thats exactly the insufficient path. So thats correct. Case 5: missing Package. So Ship comes right after Authorize. So yes, violation. So the violating cases are 2, 3, 5. Let me confirm each. Case 2: Activities: Receive Check Package Authorize Ship Close. The problem here is that Package happens before Authorize. According to the description: Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping. So Package must come after Authorize. So in this case, Package is before Authorize. So violation. Case 3: Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close. After Check, they Authorize payment. Then Cancel. So according to the description, if inventory is sufficient, after Check you should proceed to Authorize. But then why Cancel? That seems like a problem. Because once payment is authorized, the process should move to Package. But here, they canceled. So this would be a violation because after payment authorization, you shouldnt cancel. Also, after Cancel, Ship is done. Which is invalid. So two issues here. Case 5: Receive Check Authorize Ship Close. Missing Package items. So Ship comes after Authorize but without Package. Which violates the rule that Package must come before Ship. Yes. So those three cases have violations. Now, lets check if there are any other possible violations. Case 3 also has Ship after Cancel. Which is explicitly forbidden: Ship order should only occur after packaging and never after a cancellation. So after Cancel, Ship is definitely a violation. Case 2s problem is Package before Authorize. Case 5s problem is missing Package between Authorize and Ship. So all three cases (2,3,5) have violations. Let me check if Case 3s Cancel after Authorize is a problem. Because according to the normative process, once inventory is sufficient, you proceed to authorize payment, then package, ship. If inventory is insufficient, you cancel. So the Check inventory steps result determines the path. So if Check shows sufficient, then you shouldnt cancel. So in Case 3, Check inventory was done, then they authorized payment (so they assumed sufficient), but then canceled. Thats a problem. Because after Check, if sufficient, you shouldnt cancel. So the Cancel step here is not following the correct path. Alternatively, maybe the Check inventory showed insufficient, but they still authorized payment, which would be wrong. But regardless of why they canceled, the process flow requires that Cancel only comes right after Check if inventory is insufficient. So if they did Check Authorize Cancel, thats a problem because the Cancel step should not come after Authorize. Because once you authorize payment, youre in the sufficient path. So Cancel should not be part of that path. So the presence of Cancel after Authorize is a violation. Another angle: the description says if inventory is found to be sufficient, then normal progression... if not enough stock, then cancel. So the only time Cancel happens is after Check inventory when insufficient. So the sequence should be Check Cancel (if insufficient), or Check Authorize (if sufficient). So any Cancel that doesnt immediately follow Check inventory would be a problem. But in Case 3, Check is followed by Authorize, then Cancel. So Cancel is not directly after Check, which would be incorrect. Because if inventory was insufficient, you should Cancel right after Check. If sufficient, you shouldnt Cancel at all. So having Cancel after Authorize is a violation. Yes."
