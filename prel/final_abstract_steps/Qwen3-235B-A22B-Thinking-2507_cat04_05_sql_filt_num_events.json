    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in some SQL dialects, using HAVING without GROUP BY is not allowed, but here in the subquery, we are grouping by case_id, so its correct. Another point: the COUNT(*) counts all rows per case_id. Since each row is an event, thats correct."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "However, the problem says identify the number of events per case_id, exclude any case_id where this count is greater than six, and then return the full set of events for the remaining cases. The window function approach does it in one pass, but the subquery method is more straightforward for this scenario. But perhaps the expected answer is the subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING. Let me check standard practices. Typically, for this kind of problem, the subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING in the WHERE clause is the common solution."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in DuckDB, does the HAVING work correctly here? Yes, because after GROUP BY case_id, COUNT(*) gives the number of events per case, and HAVING filters those groups. Another check: if a case has exactly 6 events, its included. More than 6 (7+) are excluded. Correct. So this query should do the job."
