After treatment, a re-diagnostic test (Follow-up ECG or Blood Analysis) occurs, and if still abnormal, the loop repeats until results normalize. The process tree notation uses * (A, B), where A is the diagnostic evaluation, and B includes treatment and re-diagnostic steps. The loop structure is * (initial check, SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA)), repeating the treatment and re-diagnostic cycle if needed.
