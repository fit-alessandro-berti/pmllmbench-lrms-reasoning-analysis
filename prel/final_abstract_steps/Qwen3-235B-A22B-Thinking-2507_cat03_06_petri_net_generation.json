In Petri nets, we cannot model conditions directly without additional structure (like using a transition that has two outputs and a choice). But note: the problem does not specify that the amount is known at CA. We have to assume that after CA, the amount is known and then we decide. However, note the problem says: The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So we have two paths after CA."

Alternatively, we can leave it unlabeled? But the problem says transitions are labeled with the activity names. The activity names are only for the activities that occur. The direct path doesnt have an activity. So we can have an unlabeled transition? However, the problem does not explicitly say that every transition must be labeled."

Actually, no: the transition would be enabled once for each token, but we dont want that. We want that only one path is taken. How to enforce mutual exclusion? We can use a place that is the output of CA and the input for both the AP and the direct path. But then we have two transitions from the same place: one for AP and one for direct. This is a conflict (non-deterministic choice)."

How to model the loop without an extra transition? We can have the RDS transition output to p1? But then: RDS: p8 -> RDS -> p1 Then, from p1, we have DV: p1 -> DV -> p8.
