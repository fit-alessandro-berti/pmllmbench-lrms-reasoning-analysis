However, the problem does not specify a skip. But note: the description says the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses, meaning that if it doesn't surpass, then no approval is needed. So we have a choice after CA: either go directly to Payment (if amount <= threshold) or go through AP (if amount > threshold)."

Then RDS consumes p8 and produces a token in p1 (so that DV can be repeated). However, what about the direct path? We also have T_next_DV that consumes p8 and produces p2.
