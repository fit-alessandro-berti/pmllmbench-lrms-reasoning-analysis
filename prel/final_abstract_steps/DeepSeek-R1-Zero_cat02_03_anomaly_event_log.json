Typically, a purchase order should not be issued until the purchase requisition has been approved.\n- **Vendor Invoice Received** and **Release Payment** are both performed before **Approve Purchase Requisition**, which means that the payment was released before the purchase requisition was approved. This is a major control issue because typically approval should be given before any payment is made.\n- **Release Payment** is performed before both **Match Invoice to PO** and **Receive Goods**, which is highly unusual. Payment should only be released after the invoice has been matched to the purchase order and goods have been received to verify that what was ordered matches what was received and what was billed."

    "Text": "These anomalies could be problematic because they indicate a lack of proper control and verification in the P2P process. For instance, releasing payments before receiving an invoice or matching it to a PO could lead to financial losses due to incorrect or fraudulent payments. Additionally, receiving goods before issuing a purchase order could suggest that goods were received without an official order, which could lead to issues such as unauthorized purchases or incorrect deliveries."
