    "Text": "These anomalies could be problematic because they indicate a lack of proper control and verification in the P2P process. For instance, releasing payments before receiving an invoice or matching it to a PO could lead to financial losses due to incorrect or fraudulent payments. Additionally, receiving goods before issuing a purchase order could suggest that goods were received without an official order, which could lead to issues such as unauthorized purchases or incorrect deliveries."
