That parallel block includes Create PO, Receive Goods, Receive Invoice, Match Invoice, and Pay Invoice. The problem here is that these activities are allowed to happen in any order, which is incorrect. For example, you cant receive goods before creating a PO, or pay the invoice before receiving the goods or matching the invoice."

Let me list the dependencies: - Create PO must come after Approve Requisition. - Receive Goods must come after Create PO. - Receive Invoice must come after Receive Goods (since you cant receive an invoice before the goods are received). - Match Invoice to PO must come after both Receive Invoice and Receive Goods (since you need both to match). - Pay Invoice must come after Match Invoice."

But according to the standard process, you receive goods first, then receive the invoice. So they should be sequential. Similarly, matching the invoice to the PO requires both the PO and the invoice to be received. So the order is crucial."

Theres no parallelism here, which is correct because each step depends on the previous."
