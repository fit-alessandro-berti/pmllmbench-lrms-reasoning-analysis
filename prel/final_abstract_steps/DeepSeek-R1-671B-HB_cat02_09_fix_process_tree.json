Wait, but the problem is that after create_po, you can receive goods and receive invoice in any order, but both need to be done before matching the invoice. Then, after matching, pay, and close. So the revised structure would be a sequence where after create_po, there's a parallel block for receiving goods and invoice, then sequence of match, pay, close."

Alternatively, the root sequence has create_req, approve_req, create_po, parallel block, match_invoice, pay_invoice, close_case. ...

But since in PM4Py's process tree, each element in a sequence is executed in order, you can have the root as: root = ProcessTree(operator=Operator.SEQUENCE, children=[ create_req, approve_req, create_po, ProcessTree(operator=Operator.PARALLEL, children=[receive_goods, receive_invoice]), match_invoice, pay_invoice, close_case ])"

The original model had create_po in the parallel block, allowing, for example, receive_goods to happen before create_po, which is impossible.
