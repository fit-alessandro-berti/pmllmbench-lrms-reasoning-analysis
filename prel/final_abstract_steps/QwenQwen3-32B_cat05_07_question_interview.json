    "Text": "For example 1 Can you elaborate on the specific compliance documents required during the initial verification phase and how the property coordinator ensures they are up to date 2 How are property managers assigned to new properties and what factors are prioritized when theres a conflict in assignment criteria eg a manager with light workload but no experience in luxury units vs a busy manager with relevant experience 3 What are the most common special conditions or policies discussed during the introductory call between the property manager and landlord and how are these documented for internal teams 4 How does the company select professional photographers and certified inspectors and what is the typical timeline from scheduling to completing their work 5 When inspection issues are identified what is the process for determining which issues require immediate attention versus those that can be scheduled for later and how are repair costs typically handled 6 How does the digital marketing team determine competitive pricing for a new property and what market data sources are considered in this analysis 7 What systems or tools are used to activate a property in the rental portal and what checks are performed to ensure all data entries are accurate before going live 8 During tenant screening how are applicants with similar qualifications prioritized especially when multiple strong candidates are interested in the same property 9 Can you explain how custom lease clauses requested by landlords are reviewed and approved and which departments are involved in this approval process 10 What is the typical duration of the entire onboarding process from initial contact to property activation and are there specific milestones used to track progress 11 How are exceptions such as properties requiring special insurance handled and what additional steps are involved in onboarding these compared to standard properties 12 What communication tools and protocols are in place to ensure seamless information flow between regional offices property managers and support teams throughout the onboarding process 13 How does the company handle situations where a landlord fails to provide required documentation within the expected timeframe and what is the impact on the onboarding timeline 14 What role does the compliance officer play in the final quality check and what are the most common compliance issues identified during this review 15 How are security deposits managed financially once a lease is finalized and what processes are in place to ensure compliance with local regulations regarding deposit handling"
