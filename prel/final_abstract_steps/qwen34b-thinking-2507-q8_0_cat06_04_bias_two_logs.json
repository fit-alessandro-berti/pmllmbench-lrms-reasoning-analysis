    "Text": "The user probably wants to know how this bias affects real-world outcomes. I'll explain that the system is implicitly favoring people who belong to certain community groups (like Highland Civic Darts Club) by giving them automatic score adjustments, which leads to higher approval rates for those groups even when their base scores are lower."

The bias is systematic - it's not random but consistently applies to members of the Highland Civic Darts Club. This could be problematic if the community group isn't actually correlated with creditworthiness."
