Let me check. The subquery selects all case_ids where the count of their events is <=6. Then the outer query selects all events where the case_id is in that list. That should give all events for those cases. Yes, that seems right."

The IN approach is simpler and probably more efficient in this case."

The HAVING clause correctly filters the groups. The subquery returns a list of case_ids, and the outer query selects all columns for those cases. Yes, that should do it. So the final SQL query would be as written in the first option."
