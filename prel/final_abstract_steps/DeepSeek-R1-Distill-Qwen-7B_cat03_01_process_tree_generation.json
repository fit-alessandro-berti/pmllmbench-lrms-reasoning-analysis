    "Text": "Now, based on the triage classification, the patient is directed to one of two diagnostic tests: Comprehensive ECG (CE) if they're suspected of having a cardiovascular issue, or a Full Blood Panel (FBP) otherwise. Since this is a choice between two activities, we'll use the exclusive OR (X) operator here."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Within this loop, after consultation, an exclusive treatment choice (TM or SPT) is made using the X operator. Following treatment, a re-diagnostic test (RDT) is performed, which is another exclusive choice between FCE and FBA if the results are still abnormal."

    "Text": "This loop continues until the results are normal. Once the loop exits (i.e., results are normal), the process moves to advanced imaging and counseling, which are in true concurrency. So we'll use a + operator here, containing AI and NC."
