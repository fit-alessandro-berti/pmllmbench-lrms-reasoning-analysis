Let's craft final answer accordingly with clear sections and bullet points indicating tasks and flows, plus notes on uncertainties. We'll use indentation and labels like Task:, Gateway:, Event: etc., referencing roles in parentheses after each task name. Use arrows '->' for sequence flow lines; use 'XOR' label on gateways maybe 'Exclusive'. Also note artifacts as data objects next to tasks e.g., (Data Object: Invoice), (Data Object: Purchase Order). Let's produce final output accordingly."
