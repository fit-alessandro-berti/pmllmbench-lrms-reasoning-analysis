For each stage, think about what might be missing or unclear."

    "Text": "Starting with initial contact and documentation: Are there specific types of documents the coordinator looks for? What if documents are outdated but still sufficient? How does the coordinator decide which ones to request updates on? For assigning a property manager: Theres mention of workload, geographic specialization, experience, track record. Maybe ask how these factors are weighted or prioritized. Also, is there any training or certification required for managers handling specific types of properties (like luxury units)? The photographer and inspector roles: How are they selected? Are their reports standardized? What if the inspector finds major issues that require significant repairs? Marketing phase: Who decides the pricing models? How do they stay updated with market trends? Is there a team or individual responsible for this? Tenant screening process: How long does it typically take? Any criteria beyond credit checks and employment verification? What about background checks or criminal history? Quality checks and audits: How frequently are these conducted? Are all properties subject to the same level of audit, or is it based on risk factors? Exception handling: Specific examples like special insurance needs. Is there a standardized procedure for handling exceptions, or does each case get handled individually? Communication flow: Tools used besides email and CRMs? Any formal documentation requirements during handoffs between teams? Also, consider the overall timeline from initial contact to activation. Are there benchmarks or KPIs set for different stages? How do they handle delays in the process?"
