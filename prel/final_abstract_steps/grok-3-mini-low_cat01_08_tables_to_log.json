Map Timestamps: Each event needs a timestamp. For multiple items picked, I need to handle that. ... 4. Combine Data: Link everything via order_id, and then through invoice_id for payments. 5. Enrich with Resources: Use the resource IDs from the tables and map them using the Resources Table if needed."

Since there are multiple per order, I'll create one event per order with the earliest item_picking_date, and resource as the picker_id (maybe the most common one, or just pick one). - Order Dispatched: From Delivery table, timestamp is delivery_dispatch_date. If an order has multiple deliveries, like order 1002 has two, I might need multiple events, e.g., Order Dispatched for DLV-5002 and Order Dispatched for DLV-5003. But to keep it simple, perhaps one per delivery. - Order Arrived: From Delivery table, timestamp is delivery_arrival_date, per delivery. - Invoice Issued: From Invoice table, timestamp is invoice_issue_date, resource is billing_person_id. Orders can have multiple invoices. - Payment Received: From Payments table, timestamp is payment_date, linked via invoice_id to order_id. I need to ensure the events are in chronological order for each case."
