    "Text": "Let me test this logic with an example Suppose a case_id A has 3 events A1 A2 A3 Then another case_id B has 4 events Then both would be included If a case has 7 events its excluded Yes the CTE valid_cases selects all case_ids where total count is <=6 The main query then joins to get all rows from those cases But wait when we group in the CTE are there any issues with duplicates or missing data DuckDB handles CTEs correctly as long as they reference existing tables CTE names and columns that exist Another thing The original table has each row representing a single event So theres no need to worry about duplicate rows for the same case_id in terms of counting but if there are multiple entries with the same activity and timestamp which could happen thats allowed as per the problem statement each row is a separate event even if identical So the query should work regardless of duplicates Putting it all together The CTE valid_cases selects case_ids where COUNT <=6 Then we select all columns from event_log where case_id is in that set But wait when you group in the CTE does DuckDB handle this correctly Lets see In the CTE SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT <= 6 Yes This should return each case_id with total events <=6 Then joining back to get all rows from those cases But in some databases when you use a GROUP BY in this way without selecting into an aggregate the CTE returns distinct case_ids Wait no the group by doesnt affect uniqueness here The HAVING clause filters out groups where COUNT >6 but each row in event_log is still included if their case_id was selected Wait for example suppose a case has 7 events Then in the valid_cases CTE its excluded So when we join back to e the original table only rows with case_ids that are in the CTE will be returned But since all those cases have <=6 total events their individual rows are included Yes Because each row is part of a group case_id thats been counted and allowed if <=6 So even though there may be 7 rows for a case as long as that cases total in the CTE is <=6 which it cant be if its excluded those rows wont appear Wait no If a case has more than six events then when creating valid_cases we have already filtered out such cases So any row from a case with >6 events will not be present in the CTE Therefore joining e to vc valid_cases ensures that only rows from allowed cases are selected So this approach works"
