    "Text": "Starting with Case 2001. It was submitted at 9:00 AM, and the next day at 10:30 AM it was closed. So that's about a day and a half. Not too bad. Case 2002 was submitted at 9:05 AM and closed at 11:00 AM on the second day. That's roughly 1.5 days as well. Case 2003 started at 9:10 AM and closed on April 3rd at 9:30 AM. That's almost three days. Hmm, that's longer than the others. Case 2004 was submitted at 9:20 AM and closed the same day at 10:45 AM. So that's a bit over an hour. Case 2005 was submitted at 9:25 AM and closed on April 4th at 2:30 PM. That's almost five days. That's significantly longer than the others."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Validation - PE",

    "Text": "To fix this, maybe we need to streamline the process for High Complexity claims, perhaps by assigning specific resources or prioritizing these cases.
