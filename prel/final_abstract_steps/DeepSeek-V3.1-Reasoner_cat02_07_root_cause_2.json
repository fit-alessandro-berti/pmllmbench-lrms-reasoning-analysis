Case 2002 takes about 26 hours, which is longer due to the overnight gap after requesting documents. Case 2003 spans over two days with multiple document requests, totaling around 48 hours. Case 2004 is fast, similar to 2001. Case 2005 is the longest, taking almost 3 days because of repeated document requests."

    "Text": "Next, I should analyze the attributes. High complexity cases like 2003 and 2005 have multiple document requests, which adds delays. Also, Manager_Bill is involved in the slower cases, so maybe he has a backlog or stricter approval. Region B has mixed results, but the high complexity cases there are slower. Adjuster_Lisa in Region B handles both fast and slow cases, but her high complexity cases take longer, which makes sense."

Suggestions could include streamlining document requests, reviewing Manager_Bills workload, and maybe reallocating resources in Region B for high complexity cases."
