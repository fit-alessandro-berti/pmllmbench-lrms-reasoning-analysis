    "Text": "First, I'll look at the normative constraints. The process must follow a strict sequence: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant  [If Approved: Finalize Documentation]  Close Case. There are specific ordering rules that can't be skipped or reversed. Also, certain activities are only allowed under specific conditions, like finalizing documentation only if the loan is approved."

    "Text": "**Case 1:**\n- Activities in order: Application, Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.\n- Timestamps are sequential, and each activity follows the correct order. No issues here. It seems to comply fully with the normative rules."

    "Text": "**Case 2:**\n- The sequence is: Application, Risk Assessment (without Credit Check first), then Credit Check, Loan Decision (Rejected), Finalize Documentation, Close Case.\n- The problem here is that Risk Assessment happened before Credit Check, which violates the normative rule that Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. Also, after the loan was rejected, they still finalized documentation, which is not allowed. So, Case 2 definitely has normative violations."

    "Text": "**Case 3:**\n- The process starts with Application, then Credit Check, Risk Assessment, Loan Decision (Approved), Inform Applicant, Finalize Documentation, Close Case.\n- The normative sequence is followed correctly. However, the Credit Check happened two days later, which is more than 24 hours after the application, violating the desideratum. Also, Inform Applicant was done two days after the Loan Decision, exceeding the recommended 48 hours. Additionally, there's no Follow-up Call, which is another desideratum. So, Case 3 doesn't violate the strict rules but fails some best practices."

    "Text": "Justifications:\n- For Case 2, maybe there was an urgent need or a system error that caused the order to be mixed up. The documentation finalization after rejection might have been a mistake.\n- For Case 3, delays could be due to processing backlogs or resource issues. The lack of a Follow-up Call might be an oversight or considered unnecessary in this case."

    "Text": "I think that covers all the points. I need to make sure I'm not missing any other violations. Let me double-check each case against the normative constraints again.\n\nCase 1: All activities in correct order and no extra steps. Good.\n\nCase 2: Wrong order and unauthorized documentation. Definitely a violation.\n\nCase 3: Correct order but missed the timing and follow-up. Just desiderata issues."
