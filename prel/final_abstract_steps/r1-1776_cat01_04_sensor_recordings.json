    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. So, the goal is to analyze the event log from a manufacturing assembly line and assign activity labels based on the sensor readings. The events are from Machine M1, so I'll focus on that. Let's look at each event and see how the sensor values change over time."

    "Text": "First, I need to group the events into phases where the sensor readings show similar patterns. Let me start by listing out the events in order and note the changes in each parameter."

    "Text": "Looking at Event 1 to 3: The temperature starts at 20C, then 20, 21. Pressure is steady at 1 bar. Vibration is 0 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position is 0, and energy consumption is low (0.4-0.5 kWh). These seem like idle states because all parameters are low and stable. The machine isn't doing much here."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Then Event 4 comes in: Temperature jumps to 50C, vibration goes up to 30 Hz, material flow increases to 5 units/s, tool position moves to 5mm, and energy consumption doubles to 2 kWh. This looks like the start of an active phase. The increase in temperature and vibration could indicate some mechanical action starting. Maybe cutting metal? Because cutting usually involves high friction which generates heat and vibration."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 5-6 continue this trend: Temp rises to 55-58C, pressure slightly up to 1.5 bar, vibration increases to 35-38 Hz, tool position moves further (7-10mm), and energy goes up to 2.5-3 kWh. Material flow stays at 5 units/s. This seems like the peak of the cutting operation where the machine is actively processing material. High temp and vibration support this idea."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Event 7-8: Temperature drops to 40C, pressure increases to 2 bar, vibration drops to 10 Hz, material flow decreases to 2 units/s, tool position is now at 15mm. Energy goes down to 2 kWh. Maybe a different activity here. The lower vibration but higher pressure might indicate a pressing or assembling step where parts are being joined under pressure but with less movement."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Event 9: Temp spikes to 80C, vibration jumps to 50 Hz, material flow stops (0), tool position remains at 15mm, and energy consumption shoots up to 5 kWh. High temp and vibration with no material flowthis could be welding or another high-energy process that doesn't require moving material but needs intense heat. Welding often requires high temperatures and might not involve material flowing during the process."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Event 10: Temp drops sharply to 30C, pressure back to 1 bar, vibration very low (1 Hz), material flow still zero. Energy drops to 1 kWh. This might be a cooldown phase after welding. The machine isn't active here; maybe it's waiting or resetting."

  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Events 11-12: Temp stabilizes around 25C, pressure remains low at 1 bar, slight vibration (5 Hz), material flow at 1 unit/s, tool position moves to 20mm, energy around 1.5-1.6 kWh. This could be packaging or moving parts after welding. The low energy and moderate flow suggest moving materials into packaging without heavy processing."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but let me check if there's another possible activity for Events7-8. Higher pressure but lower vibrationmaybe quality inspection? But quality checks might not involve high pressure or movement. Alternatively, assembling parts under pressure makes sense as parts are fitted together with some force."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Also, after welding in Event9, Event10 shows a cooldown then Events11-12 have some material flow again but lower parametersmaybe moving parts into packaging? So Packaging would involve moving materials again but with less energy than cutting or welding."
