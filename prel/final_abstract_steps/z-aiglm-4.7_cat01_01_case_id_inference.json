Analyze the unique Patient Signatures: The most obvious way to differentiate patients in a log like this (without a case ID) is usually a combination of attributes that remain constant for a specific patient across different events. patient_age: Should be constant for a single case. patient_gender: Should be constant for a single case. department: Can change (e.g., ER -> Radiology). resource: Can change. activity: Obviously changes. timestamp: Increases monotonically within a case, but interleaves with others."
