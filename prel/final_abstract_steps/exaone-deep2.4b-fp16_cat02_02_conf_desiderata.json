    "Text": "The timeline seems correct for Case 1. All steps are in order: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation (as loan was approved) → Close Case. This case adheres to all normative rules and satisfies the desiderata (Credit Check completed within 24 hours, and the inform step is well within the 48-hour recommendation). No violations are identified."

    "Text": "For Case 2, the Risk Assessment occurred at 08:20, preceding the Credit Check at 09:00, which violates the rule requiring Credit Check to be completed before Risk Assessment. This incorrect ordering invalidates the risk assessment and compromises the Loan Decision at 09:30 since it is based on an improper sequence."

    "Text": "In Case 2, Finalize Documentation was performed at 10:00 despite the loan being rejected at 09:30. This breaches the rule prohibiting documentation finalization after a rejection. Moreover, the case was closed at 10:30, even though rejected cases must close without document finalization. These sequential violations compromise the entire case processing."

    "Text": "For Case 3, the Credit Check occurred at 15:00 on 2024-01-14, significantly exceeding the 24-hour recommendation (application submitted at 09:00 on 2024-01-12, causing a delay of over 40 hours). This is a desiderata violation but does not break normative rules."

    "Name": "Validation - IND",
    "Text": "The Inform Applicant step for Case 3 occurred at 15:00 on 2024-01-16, which seems excessively delayed relative to the Loan Decision that should logically follow Risk Assessment on 2024-01-14. This violates the desiderata of notifying the applicant promptly (within 48 hours). However, the exact Loan Decision time is missing from the log, making it unclear if the delay formally breaches recommendations."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Despite delays in Case 3's Credit Check and Inform Applicant steps, the sequence otherwise adheres to normative rules: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. The absence of a Normative Rules violation mitigates the effects of desiderata issues."
