Check Availability (CA) - after RO, to see if items are in stock. 3. Reserve Items (RI) - if available, then reserve them. 4. Pick Items (PI) - after reserving, pick items from shelves. 5. Quality Check (QC) - after picking, inspect items. 6. Pack Order (PO) - after QC, pack items. 7. Generate Shipping Label (GSL) - after packing? Possibly before dispatch. 8. Dispatch (D) - after label, dispatch. 9. Invoice Customer (IC) - maybe after order is processed, could be after RO or after dispatch? 10. Record Payment (RP)"
