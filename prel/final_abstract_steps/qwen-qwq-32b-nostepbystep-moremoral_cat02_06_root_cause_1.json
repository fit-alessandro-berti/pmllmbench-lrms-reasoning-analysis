Case 102: Received at 8:05 AM, closed on the next day at 9:15 AM. Let me calculate that. From 8:05 AM on March 1st to 9:15 AM on March 2nd is roughly 25 hours and 10 minutes. Thats way longer than the others. Hmm, this is a big red flag. Case 103: Received at 8:10 AM, closed at 9:30 AM same day. So about 1 hour 20 minutes. Thats even faster than 101. Case 104: Received at 8:20 AM, closed at 8:30 AM next day. Thats about 24 hours and 10 minutes. Also a long time compared to others except maybe 102. Case 105: Received at 8:25 AM, closed on the third day at 9:30 AM. Thats over 53 hours. Wow, thats a significant delay."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So possible factors: - Delay in escalating when needed ... - Slow response from Level-2 team after escalation ... - Prolonged gaps between investigation and resolution ... Additionally, maybe the initial investigation by Level-1 is taking too long ... maybe after the investigation, theres a required approval or step thats not captured here ... Maybe the Level-2 team is backlogged ... maybe theres a lack of resources in the Level-2 team ... communication issues between teams causing delays. ... workforce management issues."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the key points to highlight: Delays are primarily in: - Escalation to Level-2 is slow ... - Level-2s response time after escalation is too slow ... - The time between investigation and resolution is consistently long ... So the main root causes are the long waiting time after investigation ... And the delays in Level-2 handling escalated tickets."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Therefore, recommendations would be: - Review the investigation to resolution process ... - Ensure Level-2 has enough staff ... - Train Level-1 agents to escalate sooner ... - Maybe introduce SLAs ... - Streamline the escalation process ... - Implement SLAs ... - Investigate why the post-investigation steps take so long ... - Provide training ... - Ensure that the investigation steps are followed by timely resolution ... - Maybe automation ..."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So putting all this together, the root causes are: 1. Slow escalation process and delays in Level-2 response after escalation. 2. Extended delays between investigation and resolution steps across all escalated and some non-escalated tickets. 3. Potential overwork of Level-1 agents causing delays in starting investigation. The recommendations would target these points, suggesting process improvements, better staffing, training, and SLA enforcement."
