    "Text": "Case 3s timeline: After Check inventory, they did Authorize, then Cancel, then Ship, then Close. Wait, the norm states that once an order is canceled, you cant do fulfillment steps. So the Ship after Cancel is definitely wrong. Also, why was Authorize done if inventory was insufficient? Maybe the inventory was sufficient, but then they decided to cancel for another reason? But according to the process description, the only reason to cancel is insufficient inventory. So if they did authorize, that implies inventory was sufficient, but then they canceled regardless. The process doesnt mention any other reason for cancellation. So the norm might not account for that scenario, but according to the given process description, if inventory is sufficient, they should proceed with the normal path. Therefore, in case 3, the fact that they did Cancel after authorization is not allowed. Because once youve authorized, you should proceed to package, etc. So the Cancel after Authorize is an issue. Additionally, in case 3, after Cancel, they proceeded to Ship, which is invalid."

Case 3: - After Check inventory, they did Authorize Payment. If they had enough inventory, then they should not have canceled. But since they canceled, that implies the inventory was insufficient, so Authorize should not have occurred. So Authorize is done erroneously before Cancel. - Also, after Cancel, they did Ship Order, which is not allowed because after cancellation, no fulfillment steps allowed. So two violations here: Authorize before Cancel, and Ship after Cancel. Case 5: - After Authorize, they went straight to Ship without Packaging. The norm requires Package must come after Authorize and before Ship. So missing the Package step between Auth and Ship is a violation."
