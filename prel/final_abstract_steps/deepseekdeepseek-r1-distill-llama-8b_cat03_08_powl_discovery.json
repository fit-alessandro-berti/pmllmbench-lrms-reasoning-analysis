    "Text": "Now how to model this using POWL First the loop between IQC and AS Since IQC can repeat perhaps we can model this as a loop node that includes AS Wait but in the POWL model the loop is a node that represents a loop between two sub models Wait the loop operator in POWL is represented as A B meaning execute A then either exit the loop or execute B and then A again repeating until the loop is exited So for the IQC loop perhaps after IQC if it fails it goes back to AS Or is it a loop between IQC and AS Alternatively perhaps after AS it goes back to IQC But looking at the logs after IQC it goes to AS again So perhaps IQC is part of a loop that includes AS Wait maybe the loop is inside the IQC step meaning IQC can repeat until it passes So IQC is a loop node that includes itself until it succeeds But Im not sure if thats how loops are structured in POWL Wait in the example given earlier the loop is represented as A B meaning execute A then either exit or execute B and loop again So perhaps for IQC if it fails it loops back to the same point But in the logs after IQC fails it goes back to AS So maybe the loop is IQC AS IQC AS until IQC passes So IQC is part of a loop that also includes AS Therefore the loop node would be IQC AS So execute IQC then either exit or execute AS and loop back to IQC But wait that would mean after IQC if it fails it goes back to AS But in the logs after IQC fails it goes back to AS So that makes sense"
