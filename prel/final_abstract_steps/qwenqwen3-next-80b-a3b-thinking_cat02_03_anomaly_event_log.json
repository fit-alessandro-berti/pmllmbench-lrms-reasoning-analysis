    "Text": "Standard P2P process usually goes like this: 1. Create Purchase Requisition (PR) - someone requests goods/services. 2. Approve PR - manager or authorized person approves the requisition. 3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) - after approval, the PO is sent to the vendor. 4. Receive Goods - once the vendor delivers, the goods are received and checked. 5. Vendor Invoice Received - the vendor sends an invoice. 6. Match Invoice to PO - matching the invoice with the PO and the goods receipt (three-way match: PO, invoice, goods receipt). 7. Release Payment - after matching, payment is processed. 8. Close Case - final step. There might be variations, but generally, you can't receive goods before issuing a PO. Also, you can't match invoice to PO before receiving the goods or having the invoice."

Normally, you need to approve the PR first before issuing the PO. Because the PO is issued based on the approved requisition. So issuing PO before approval is a red flag."

Because the PR must be approved before you can issue a PO. So this is an anomaly. Then Vendor Invoice Received (Feb3 07:00)  Release Payment (07:15). So payment was released before receiving goods? Because Receive Goods happens on Feb4 09:00. So they paid before receiving the goods. That's another issue. Because you shouldn't pay before receiving the goods. Unless it's a prepayment, but typically in P2P, payment is after goods receipt and invoice matching."

Next step is Vendor Invoice Received on Feb9 12:00. Then Receive Goods on Feb10 13:00. Then Match Invoice to PO on Feb11. Wait, that's a problem. They released payment before receiving the invoice and before receiving goods. That's a big issue.

In fact, payment released before even the invoice was received. So payment before invoice and goods. Case 1004: - Received goods before issuing PO. Which is impossible because you need PO to receive goods (as the PO is the document that authorizes delivery)."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, why are these problematic? For Case 1002: - Issuing PO without PR approval: This bypasses internal controls. The PR approval is supposed to ensure that the purchase is authorized and within budget. Skipping this step could lead to unauthorized purchases. - Payment before receiving goods: Risk of paying for goods that were never delivered. Could be fraud or error. - Payment before matching invoice to PO: The three-way match (PO, invoice, goods receipt) is a key control to ensure that you're paying for what was ordered and received. Skipping this could lead to overpayment or paying for incorrect items. For Case 1003: - Payment released before invoice received: You can't pay without an invoice. So this is impossible. For Case 1004: - Receive goods before issuing PO: How can you receive goods without a PO? The PO is what the vendor uses to ship. If they received goods without a PO, that could mean they're accepting deliveries without proper authorization."

    "Text": "But in the case of 1003, the Release Payment is before Vendor Invoice Received. So payment before invoice. Which is problematic unless it's a prepayment. However, in most standard P2P processes, payment is not made before the invoice is received. So this is a red flag. Because you need the invoice to verify the amount to pay. So paying without an invoice could lead to overpaying or paying incorrect amounts."

Each of these could lead to risks like fraud, unauthorized purchases, payment for undelivered goods, overpayment, etc."
