Maybe assign arbitrary case IDs like Case1, Case2, Case3 based on the order they first appear. Since the user asked to infer the case IDs, I can list them as: Case for Patient 45 M: Events 1,4,7,12,15 Case for Patient 62 F: Events 2,5,8,10,11,14,17 Case for Patient 28 M: Events 3,6,9,13,16,18 To make it clear, I'll output something like: Inferred Cases: Case 1 (Patient: Age 45, Gender M): ...
