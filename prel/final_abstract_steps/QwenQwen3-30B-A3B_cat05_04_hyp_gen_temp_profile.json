Why would the time between Receive and Approve be so tightly clustered? Maybe there's an automated process that approves claims quickly without human intervention, but that might not be standard. Or maybe some claims are being rushed through, skipping steps. Alternatively, maybe the data is synthetic, with fake timestamps."

This could mean that some claims are delayed for a week, while others are notified almost immediately. Possible reasons: backlogs in the approval process, or maybe some claims are being approved and notified quickly, while others are stuck.
