    "Text": "From Interview 1 with Mary (Accounts Payable Clerk), the process starts when an invoice is received, usually by email. The first step is checking for a valid PO number. If not present, it's sent back. If there's a PO, she logs it into the system and forwards it to Purchasing (Dan's department) for confirmation of goods received. Then she matches invoice line items with the PO. If there's a discrepancy, she emails Purchasing; if unresolved, escalates to her supervisor Rita. Once resolved and manager approval is done, payment is scheduled."

Forward to Purchasing (Dan) for goods receipt confirmation 4. Purchasing checks against PO: - If discrepancy: Contact supplier or hold invoice - If missing PO: Mary needs to get info - If okay: Confirm back to AP 5. AP matches invoice to PO: - Matches: Send to Manager (Carlos) for approval - Doesn't match: Email Purchasing (Dan) to clarify - If unresolved: Escalate to Rita 6. Manager Approval: - Approved: Schedule payment - Rejected/Questionable: Investigate further 7. Exceptions handled by Rita: Contact suppliers/departments, create retrospective PO if needed, then back to normal flow. 8. Karen is involved in resolving discrepancies by contacting suppliers."

    "Text": "Also note any conflicts or uncertainties. For example, Dan mentions telling Mary if the PO is missing during his step, but Mary initially checks for PO at the start. So maybe there are cases where a PO is present but invalid? Or maybe Dan sometimes finds that the PO number isn't valid even if present? Or perhaps Mary checks for presence of a PO number but Dan checks validity? Need to clarify but since it's conflicting accounts, indicate uncertainty."

    "Text": "Given conflicting accounts from interviews (e.g., around steps for confirming goods receipt and verification of details against the Purchase Order), we consolidate by modeling the process so that roles are distinct yet flexible where ambiguity exists. This includes noting that Mary forwards the invoice for both confirmation and correctness validation, while Dan verifies matching details."
