The prompt includes a description of a complex insurance claim management process, with activities (C, CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL). The process begins with a start place (perhaps start or claim_arrived) and ends with a final place (closed claim). The initial marking should have a token in the start place. The final marking should have a token in the final place."

Otherwise, maybe skip approval and go directly to Payment (P). But the description says Approval (AP): The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold.

Actually RDS should happen after DV if docs incomplete, then go back to DV. So we need a loop: after DV, we have a place p_DV_done that can go to transition FC or to RDS. After RDS, we go back to p_DV_done (or back to DV?). Actually after re-document submission, you need to do DV again. So we could have RDS transition from p_DV_done to a place p_RDS_done, then from p_RDS_done to transition DV."

II transition consumes token from p_FC_done and produces token back to p_DV_done? Or to p_FC_ready? Actually we need to go back to FC. So we could have II transition produce token back to p_DV_done, which would be before FC again. But that would also allow RDS loop again? Actually after II, we want to go back to FC (i.e., after DV).
