After CS, two parallel tasks: Datacenter Allocation (DA) and Access Control Initialization (ACI)\n4. Then a loop: Base Network Configuration (BNC)  optionally Debug & Reconfigure (D&R)  repeat until stable\n5. After loop, exclusive choice between Containerized Deployment (CD) and Monolithic Deployment (MD)\n6. After deployment, partial order of Quality Assurance (QA) and Security Audit (SA) that can run concurrently\n7. Finally, Go-Live Approval (GLA) after both QA and SA"

    "Text": "Hmm, important to note that the loop is a BNC followed by optional D&R that repeats until stable. The description says this (BNC followed by optional D&R) repeats until the configuration is stable. So the loop structure is: execute BNC, then optionally do D&R, and if not stable, repeat the whole loop.\n\nFor the loop node, I should use OperatorPOWL with Operator.LOOP. The children would be [BNC, D&R]? Wait no - the loop description says a loop between two POWL models (a loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by * (A, B) and tells that you execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again. So for our case, A is BNC, and B is D&R? ... Yes, that matches the POWL definition. So the loop is * (BNC, D&R)."
