The model captures the hiring process with its key stages and potential bias points. The partial order ensures a structured progression through the application review stages with a loop for data completeness and an XOR choice for cultural evaluation paths. The next thinking continues the partial order definition so Ill complete the thought by copying over the remaining part of the thinking to ensure continuity root.order.add_edge ManagerialReview FinalDecision The process flow now includes a standard cultural fit check as the exclusive alternative removing the community affiliation check. This simplifies the decision logic while maintaining the core evaluation structure. The root partial order now represents a more streamlined workflow with clear sequential dependencies between each stage of the hiring process."
