    "Text": "First, I need to understand what each group is. Group A is protected, so maybe they're a group that's supposed to be protected from bias, like a demographic group that's supposed to be treated fairly. Group B is unprotected, so perhaps they're the ones that might be subject to bias. But I need to check the data to see if that's the case."

The ScoreAdjustment is 0 in all cases, and the FinalDecision is Approved, N/A, Approved. Wait, the first case, P001, the Decision is Approved, then P002 is Rejected, and P003 is Approved. So there's a mix of approvals and rejections. But since they are protected, maybe the system is supposed to be fair. However, the ScoreAdjustment is 0 for all. The final decisions are based on the Score, but maybe there's some other factor."

    "Text": "Now, Group B. They have LocalResident as TRUE, and some entries have CommunityGroup as \"Highland Civic Darts Club\", others as None. The PreliminaryScore varies.

In Group B, some entries have a +10 adjustment, others don't. The CommunityGroup is present in some cases. For instance, U001 and U003 have the same CommunityGroup, and they both get a +10 adjustment. However, U002 has no CommunityGroup and no adjustment.
