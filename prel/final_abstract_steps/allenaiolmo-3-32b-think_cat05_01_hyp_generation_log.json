The expected order should follow these steps sequentially. Let me look at the example data for each case. Starting with case 1001. The events are in order: Register (1), Credit Check (2), Validate Stock (3), Confirm Shipment (4), Ship Goods (5), Issue Invoice (6), Receive Payment (7). That looks normal. The timestamps are increasing, which is good. The resources involved make sense: SalesRep, then CreditOfficer, WarehouseClerk, LogisticsMgr, etc. No obvious issues here."

Lets list them by event_id: 8: Register Order (SalesRep_02) at 08:20 9: Confirm Shipment (LogisticsMgr_2) at 08:25  that is before Credit Check and Validate Stock. That is a problem because Confirm Shipment should come after those steps. Then event 10 is Ship Goods at 08:40, which is after Confirm Shipment. But the issue is that Credit Check (event 11) and Validate Stock (event 12) are after Confirm Shipment. So that is a major anomaly. The steps are out of sequence."

So event 17 (Ship Goods) is before event 19 (Confirm Shipment at 09:45). That is a problem. Confirm Shipment should come before Ship Goods. So here, Ship Goods is done before Confirm Shipment, which is the reverse of the normal flow. That is an anomaly."

    "Text": "Case 1004 has some interesting issues. Lets see: 21: Register Order (09:00) 22: Receive Payment (09:05)  This is way too early. Receive Payment is the last step (step 7), so it should come after all others. But here it is right after Register, skipping all intermediate steps. That is a major anomaly. Then Issue Invoice (23 at 09:20) comes after Receive Payment, which is also wrong because Invoice should be issued before payment is received."

Out-of-order activities (e.g., Confirm Shipment before Credit Check/Validate Stock in case 1002; Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment in 1003; Receive Payment before other steps in 1004). 2. Missing steps: For example, in case 1004, after Register, they went straight to Receive Payment, skipping Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, and Issue Invoice (though Invoice was done after payment, which is wrong)."

    "Text": "First, lets list possible anomalies to investigate with SQL: 1. Out-of-order activities: Check if any case has activities not following the standard sequence. The expected order of activities is: Register Order, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment. So for each case, we can list the activities in the order they occurred and see if they deviate. To do this, we can order events by timestamp and case_id, then check if the activity names follow the expected order."
