Then there's an XOR between N and a silent transition (skip), meaning sometimes they might not notify the customer. Also, the partial ordering adds an edge from A to C, which could let claims close prematurely without going through the loop and xor steps."

The loop between E and P: maybe a business rule changed to allow re-evaluation if approval fails, but it's implemented incorrectly as a loop. Or maybe a miscommunication led to thinking that multiple approvals are needed. Or maybe the modeler intended to handle a scenario where evaluation needs to happen again after approval, but that's not part of the intended process."

    "Text": "The premature closing (A C edge) could be a mistake in modeling. Maybe someone added that edge by accident, or there's a misunderstanding of the process flow, allowing adjusters to close claims early. It might be a technical error in the model where the strict order wasn't enforced."

So, claims with C event but no N event in their sequence.\n3. Premature closing (A to C): Find claims where Close (C) happened before Evaluate (E) or Approve (P).
