    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I reasoned that consistent naming based on activity context (e.g., initial, re-verification, follow-up) would make the process more understandable and disambiguate recurring activity names."

    "Text": "When considering naming for 'Verify Documents' and 'Call Customer,' I revisited previous cases (e.g., C001 vs. C002) to ensure consistency and fit for varying contexts (like post-adjustment or initial phases)."
