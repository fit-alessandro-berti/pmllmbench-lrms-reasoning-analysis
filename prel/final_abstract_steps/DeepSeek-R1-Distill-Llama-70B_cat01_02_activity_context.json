  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "First I need to understand the structure of the log Each case represents a customer support ticket and each has several events with activities timestamps resources and additional context The key point is that the same activity name can appear multiple times in a case but each occurrence has a different meaning based on context"

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at the log I see that the activities Verify Documents and Call Customer appear multiple times in different cases My task is to identify these recurring activities and rename them to reflect their specific contexts"
