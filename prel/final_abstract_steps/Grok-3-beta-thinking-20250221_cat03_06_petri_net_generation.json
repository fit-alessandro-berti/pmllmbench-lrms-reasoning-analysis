p_before_CL -> t_CL -> p_end\nSo, that way, each activity has its own before and after places, but since they are sequential, it's fine.\n\nAlternatively, I can use p_after_P as p_before_N, etc., but to make it consistent, perhaps defining separate places for each.\n\nBut actually, in Petri nets, for a sequence, you can have a chain like p0 -> t1 -> p1 -> t2 -> p2 -> ..., so yes, having a place between each transition.\n\nSo, let's define:\n\np_start\np_after_CR (which is

p_before_activity for each activity, and additional places for the choices.\n\nBut to keep it simple, let's stick with the earlier naming.\n\nNow, let's try to define the arcs.\n\nFirst, the main

-> p_after_P\np_after_P -> t_N -> p_after_N\np_after_N -> t_CL -> p_after_CL\nYes.\n\nNow, for the initial marking, it should have a token in p_start.\n\nFor the final marking, it should have a token in p_after_CL.\n\nAlso, in the code, I need to make sure that all places and transitions are properly added to the net, and the arcs are correctly defined.\n\nMoreover, since the problem mentions \"the final marking is the final state of the Petri net,\" and in the example, it's a marking with a token in the sink place, so similarly, here, the final marking should have a token in p_after_CL.\n\nAdditionally, in the code, I need to define the Petri net, add places and transitions, add arcs, and define im and fm.\n\nAlso, note that in the example, they used petri_utils.add_arc_from_to to add arcs.\n\nSo, I should do the same.\n\nNow, let's think about how to structure the code.\n\nFirst, import the necessary modules:\n\npython\nWrap\nCopy\nfrom

PetriNet.Place(\"p_before_RDS\")\np_before_II = PetriNet.Place(\"p_before_II\")\nWait, actually, in the sequential part, since p_after_P is before t_N, I can define p_after_P and then use it as the input for t_N, similarly for the others.\n\nBut in the code, I need to make sure that the arcs are correctly defined.\n\nAlternatively, to simplify, I can define:\n\np_start\np_before_DV\np_after_DV\np_before_FC\np_after_FC\np_before_CA\np_after_CA\np_before_AP\np_before_P\np_after_P (which is p_before_N)\np_after_N (which is

= PetriNet.Transition(\"t_doubts\", None)\nt_no_approval_needed = PetriNet.Transition(\"t_no_approval_needed\", None)\nt_approval_needed = PetriNet.Transition(\"t_approval_needed\", None)\nThen, add them to the
