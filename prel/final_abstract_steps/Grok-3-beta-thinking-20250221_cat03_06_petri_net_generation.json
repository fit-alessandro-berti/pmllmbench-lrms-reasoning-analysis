    "Text": "From the description, it seems that the process starts with Claim Registration (CR), then proceeds to Document Verification (DV). After DV, if documents are incomplete, it goes to RDS, and then back to DV, potentially looping until documents are complete. Once documents are verified, it moves to Fraud Check (FC). If FC raises doubts, it goes to In-depth Investigation (II), and this can loop back to FC until no more doubts are raised. After FC, it proceeds to Claim Assessment (CA), then to Approval (AP) if necessary, then to Payment (P), Notification (N), and finally Closure (CL)."

    "Text": "Now, for the conditional paths, like after DV, if documents are incomplete, go to RDS, else proceed to FC. Similarly, after FC, if doubts are raised, go to II, else proceed to CA. And after CA, if the amount is above threshold, go to AP, else proceed to P."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But actually, since AP is only needed if the amount is above threshold, it's a choice based on the claim amount. In Petri nets, since we don't have data, we can model it as a choice: either take the path through AP or directly to P."

    "Text": "In process modeling, such decisions are often represented by XOR splits, where based on some condition, one path or the other is taken. In Petri nets, this can be modeled by having a place with multiple outgoing transitions, and the firing of one transition disables the others."

    "Text": "So, let's think about how to model the loops. For the document verification loop: After DV, if documents are complete, proceed to FC. If documents are incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV. So, this is a loop that continues until documents are complete."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "For example, after DV, there could be a place, and then two transitions: one for 'documents verified successfully,' leading to FC, and another for 'documents incomplete,' leading to RDS."

    "Text": "Next, for the fraud check loop: After FC, if no doubts, proceed to CA. If doubts, go to II, then back to FC. So, similarly: From p_before_FC -> t_FC -> p_after_FC."
