The first few are retrieving a raw metal sheet, scanning a barcode, placing it on a table, aligning with a robot, preheating. Then they pick up a welding tool, weld two corners, measure the weld, apply coating, dry it, and then a visual check."

    "Text": "So, the first part seems like preparing the metal sheet. The steps are: retrieve, scan, place, align, preheat. These are all part of preparing the material. The robot aligns it, which is part of the preparation. Then preheating is a step thats necessary before welding."

    "Text": "Then, after that, they pick up the welding tool, weld the corners, measure the weld, apply coating, dry it, and check visually. The coating and drying might be part of the finishing process. The visual check is a quality assurance step."

    "Text": "Wait, but the measurement of the weld integrity is part of the assembly process, maybe. Or is it a separate step? The user might consider that the measurement is part of quality inspection. Alternatively, maybe the assembly includes the welding and the measurement. So the assembly step would include the welding and the measurement. Then the coating and drying are another step. Then the visual check is a quality check."

    "Text": "So, putting it all together: High-level steps could be: 1. Material Preparation: preparing the metal sheet (retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating). 2. Assembly: welding the corners, measuring the weld integrity, applying the coating, drying. Wait, but the coating and drying are after the welding. So maybe the assembly step includes the welding and the measurement. Then the coating and drying are separate steps."
