The first few are retrieving a raw metal sheet, scanning a barcode, placing it on a table, aligning with a robot, preheating. Then they pick up a welding tool, weld two corners, measure the weld, apply coating, dry it, and then a visual check."

The measuring the weld integrity is part of ensuring the assembly is correct. 3. Coating & Drying: applying the coating and then drying it. These are steps that finish the component after the welding. 4. Quality Inspection: the visual check is a quality check. The measurement of the weld integrity is part of quality inspection.

Assembly: The welding process involves picking up the welding tool, welding the corners, and measuring the weld integrity. These steps are part of assembling the component. Coating & Drying: Applying the coating and then drying it are steps that complete the finishing process of the component. Quality Inspection: The visual check is a quality assurance step that ensures the component meets the required standards."
