For example, in Case A, there's a retrieval of metal sheet, scanning a barcode, placing it, aligning, preheating, picking up a welding tool, welding, measuring, applying coating, drying, and checking. Then in Case B, similar events but with different parts."

    "Text": "Looking at the high-level steps, \"Material Preparation\" makes sense here. The first few events are retrieving and placing the metal sheet, which are part of preparing the raw material. Then scanning and aligning, preheating, and placing the sheet on the table."

    "Text": "Then welding, measuring, applying coating, drying, and checking. So that covers preparation, then assembly, welding, inspection, and quality control."

    "Text": "Wait, but in the sample, the first case ends with checking, which is part of quality control. So the high-level steps would be Material Preparation, Assembly, Quality Inspection, and Welding. That makes sense."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - NE",
    "Text": "But wait, the welding and checking are part of the process, so maybe the steps should be more like: Material Preparation (planning and setting up), Assembly (welding), Quality Inspection (checking), and then the final check."

    "Text": "I need to make sure each high-level step is a coherent stage. For example, Material Preparation includes all the steps before assembly. Assembly is welding. Quality Inspection is checking. So that's good."

    "Text": "So the answer would be to group into those steps and explain each. Let me check the sample again. In the first case, the high-level steps are Material Preparation, Assembly, Quality Inspection, and Welding. In the second case, similar. So that's consistent."
