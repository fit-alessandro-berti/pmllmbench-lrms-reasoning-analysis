Hmm, perhaps the problem wants exactly the K most frequent variants, even if there are ties. For example, if K=3, and the third position has multiple variants with the same count, then all should be included. But how to handle that in SQL. The best way is to use the window function and include all variants where the count is >= the K-th highest distinct count.\n\nAlternatively, use a subquery to get the K-th largest case_count, and then select all variants with case_count >= that value. However, that approach can include more than K variants if there are ties on the K-th value.\n\nBut that's exactly the desired behavior. For example, if the top K=3 may actually return 5 variants because the third distinct count has multiple variants. But the problem says \"the top K variants by their frequency\".

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think this approach is better because it includes all variants that are in the top K when considering their frequency. So, for the example:\n\nIf variants have case_counts 10,10,9,8,8,7. For K=2:\n\n- DENSE_RANK is 1,1,2,3,3,4.\n\nSo selecting DENSE_RANK <=2 would include all variants with case_counts 10,10,9. So three variants. So K=2 in terms of dense ranks, which are 1 and 2. But the actual count of variants is three. So the answer includes all variants in the top two frequency levels. \n\nThis might be the desired behavior, but the problem statement says \"the top K variants by their frequency\". So if K is 2, the top two are the two highest frequency levels. So the first frequency is 10, the second is 9. So variants with 10 and 9 are included, which are three variants. So in this case, the answer includes three variants.\n\nBut the problem says \"the top K variants by their frequency (i.e., the number of cases that follow that variant)\". So the number of cases is the count. So the top K variants are those with the highest counts. So if multiple variants share the same highest count, they are all part of the top 1, and if K is 2, then the next highest count is considered. \n\nThis suggests that using DENSE_RANK is the correct approach, as it groups all variants with the same case_count into the same rank. Then, selecting where the dense_rank is <= K gives all variants with case_count in the top K distinct case counts."
