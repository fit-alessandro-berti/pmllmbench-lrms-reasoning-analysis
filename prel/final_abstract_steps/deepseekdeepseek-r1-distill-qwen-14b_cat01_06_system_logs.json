First, the system log has events with timestamps, action types, and related attributes. My goal is to convert each event into a meaningful activity within a case. Cases should represent coherent units of work, like editing a document or handling an email. Ill need to infer these cases by looking at sequences and application interactions."

For example, the user starts with Quarterly_Report.docx, switches to Document1.docx, works on it, saves, switches to email, and so on. Each switch might indicate a new case or continuation of a previous one."

The user starts with Quarterly_Report.docx, then moves to Document1.docx, works on it, saves, switches to email, works on that, then back to Word and Excel. It looks like each document and email handling is a separate case, but sometimes the user revisits a document, which might still belong to the same case."
