    "Text": "Okay I need to come up with a list of open-ended questions to ask the interviewee about their property onboarding process. Let me start by going through the description again to make sure I dont miss any key points. The process starts with the landlord contacting the regional office. The coordinator checks their docs like deeds and compliance certificates. If somethings missing they ask for updates. Once verified they input details into the database. Then a property manager is assigned based on workload geography experience and track record. They meet the landlord to set expectations. Then they arrange a photographer and inspector. If there are issues they work with the landlord to fix them. Once cleared marketing is done and the property goes live. Then tenant screening happens including credit checks etc. Once a tenant is chosen lease is finalized deposit collected and move-in scheduled. Finally there are quality checks by compliance finance IT etc. There are exceptions like special insurance or custom clauses. Communication is via emails CRM project tools."

    "Text": "Hmm some of these might be too specific but maybe I should group them into broader categories. The user wants open-ended questions that dig into decision criteria roles timing exceptions etc. Maybe structure questions around each phase: Starting with the initial contact: How do you determine which documents are essential versus optional during the initial review? What criteria? When assigning a property manager how do you weigh the factors like workload geography experience track record? Is there a scoring system? For the inspection: What are the most common issues that come up and how are they prioritized? Marketing pricing: How is the market analysis conducted? Who is involved in setting the price range? Tenant screening: What are the red flags that lead to rejecting an application? Are there any automated systems here? Quality checks: How do compliance finance and IT coordinate their reviews? Are there any handoffs between these teams? Exceptions: What are the most common exceptions and how are they handled? How does the process branch when exceptions occur? Communication: How is communication tracked across all stakeholders? Is there a central system or are there potential gaps? Timeline: Are there SLAs for each step? How is the overall timeline managed? Roles: Are there any overlaps or handoffs between teams that are particularly challenging?"

Maybe start with What factors or How do you handle Can you describe What determines How are decisions made What happens when How are conflicts resolved How do teams coordinate etc. Need to ensure they cover all aspects: decision criteria like manager assignment document requirements pricing roles who does what handoffs responsibilities timing timeframes stages delays exceptions custom clauses missing docs major issues special cases etc. and communication processes. Also ask about how they handle unexpected events like a sudden regulatory change or a key team member being unavailable. Maybe also ask about training for new staff in handling these steps or how they handle scaling the process as the company grows. Wait the user specified not to ask about implementation details or SQL so focus on the process flow not the tech behind it. Let me structure the questions into sections based on the process steps but phrased as open-ended questions. Alright compiling all these thoughts into a list of open-ended questions avoiding duplicates and ensuring they cover the key areas."
