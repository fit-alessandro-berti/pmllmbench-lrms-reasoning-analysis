    "Text": "Let me go through each case one by one. Case 1: Looking at the activities in order: Application Received → Credit Check → Risk Assessment → Loan Decision (Approved) → Inform Applicant → Finalize Documentation → Close Case. This seems to follow the normative sequence. All steps are in the correct order. Since it's approved, Finalize Documentation is done before closing. No steps skipped, order is correct. No violations here."

    "Text": "Case 2: Activities: Application Received → Risk Assessment (without prior Credit Check)—violation here because Credit Check must come before Risk Assessment. Then they did Credit Check after, which is out of order. Then Loan Decision (Rejected). Then Finalize Documentation, which shouldn't happen after rejection. Then Close Case. So two violations: Risk Assessment before Credit Check, and Finalize after rejection. Both against normative rules."

No Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum. But normative rules check: The order is correct. Application → Credit Check (even if late) → Risk → Decision → Inform → Finalize (approved) → Close. So no normative violations. But they missed the Follow-up Call, which is a desideratum."

Case 1: Application Received at 9:00 → Credit Check at 9:30 (within 24 hours, good) → Loan Decision at 11:00, Inform Applicant at 13:00 (same day, within 48 hours, good). So timing desiderata are met. But no Follow-up Call mentioned. So desideratum miss here."

Then Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30 and Inform Applicant at 10:00 (within 48 hours, okay). However, Finalize Documentation after rejection is a normative violation. The Credit Check, though performed late in sequence, met the 24-hour timing desideratum (1h after application). So no desideratum violation here apart from missed Follow-up Call, but normative violations stand: 1) Risk Assessment before Credit Check. 2) Finalize Documentation after rejection."
