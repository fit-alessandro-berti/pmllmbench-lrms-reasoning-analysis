If approved, then Prototype Creation (PC) -> Laboratory Testing (LT) -> User Testing (UT) -> Then another Approval Gate (AG) might occur? But note: the activity list has only one Approval Gate (AG).

For the other keys (like response, precedence, etc.): the value is a dictionary with keys being the activities and value being (support, confidence). But note: these constraints are binary. So the keys for these constraints are typically pairs of activities. However, the prompt says for these keys the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities (note: it doesn't say pairs). This might be a mistake in the prompt."
