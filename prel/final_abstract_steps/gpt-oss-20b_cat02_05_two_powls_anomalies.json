Edges: Post->Screen; Screen->Decide; Screen->Interview; Decide->Onboard; Onboard->Payroll; Payroll->Close. So order: Post before Screen. But then both Decide and Interview depend on Screen (i.e., can happen in parallel). But Decision depends on Screening but not on Interview? Actually no edge from Interview to Decide or vice versa. So they can happen concurrently or in any order relative to each other (since no precedence). That violates typical logic because decision should come after interview(s)."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also edges: Post->Screen ; Post->Interview ; meaning screen and interview can happen concurrently right after posting job ad without sequencing them properly - they might occur in parallel incorrectly because usually screen first then interview(s) based on screened candidates only. Having them both directly dependent only on post means they could be executed simultaneously or in any order relative each other - anomaly moderate/severe as well because interviewing unscreened candidates may waste resources."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So Model2 anomalies: Optional skipping of Payroll step via XOR with silent transition violates essential step. Optional looping of onboard step may cause indefinite loops or repeated tasks unnecessarily. Parallel execution of screen and interview due lack of precedence relation leads inefficiency. Thus Model1 seems more aligned albeit still flawed regarding decision timing relative interviews."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "We evaluate severity: Model1's main issue is possible early hiring decisions before interviews complete - moderate severity. Model2's issues include skipping essential payroll addition - severe violation. Also looping onboard unnecessarily adds complexity. Additionally parallel screen/interview reduces efficiency. Therefore Model2 has more severe anomalies compared with Model1."
