The activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, Approve Request. Oh, Verify Documents appears twice. Next, Case C002: Activities are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Call Customer again, Approve Request. Call Customer appears twice. Case C003: Activities are Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer, Adjust Account, Verify Documents again, Approve Request. Verify Documents appears twice."

    "Text": "Now I need to figure out whats different between the two. The first Verify Documents is by a BackOfficeAgent checking identity documents, and the second is a BackOfficeAgent re-checking documents after an ID scan is provided. So the first is initial verification, the second is re-verification. For Call Customer in C002: The first is a FrontlineAgent calling to clarify an account discrepancy, the second is a FrontlineAgent following up to confirm adjustments. So the first is initial clarification, the second is follow-up confirmation. For Verify Documents in C003: First is BranchOfficer physical verification of ID, second is BranchOfficer re-verifying after an account adjustment. So first is initial physical check, second is re-check after adjustment."

    "Text": "Now I need to rename them to reflect the context. Lets list each recurring activity with their context: For Verify Documents in C001: First occurrence is initial verification (customer uploaded ID scan), second is re-verification (after adjustment). Maybe Initial Document Verification and Re-verification of Documents. For Call Customer in C002: First is initial clarification (outbound call about discrepancy), second is follow-up (confirm adjustments). So Initial Customer Clarification Call and Follow-up Confirmation Call. For Verify Documents in C003: First is physical verification (initial ID check at branch), second is re-verification (after account adjustment). So Initial Physical Document Verification and Re-verification of Documents After Account Adjustment."

    "Text": "Wait, but maybe for consistency, use Initial and Subsequent but with more context. Or use the actor plus the action? Wait, no, the problem says to reflect their contextual differences based on position or context. Lets check the additional context: C001 first Verify Documents: Agent checks identity documents (initial) C001 second Verify Documents: Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided (re-check) So maybe Initial Document Verification by BackOfficeAgent and Re-verification of Documents by BackOfficeAgent for C001. But the problem says to rename to reflect context, not necessarily the actor."

    "Text": "Wait, but in C003, the second Verify Documents is after Adjust Account, so maybe Re-verification of Documents (After Account Adjustment) is better to link the context. The problem statement says highlight their roles in the process flow, so the role here is that the second verification is after an adjustment, so mentioning that context is important. Lets adjust the second Verify Documents in C003 to Re-verification of Documents (After Account Adjustment) to be more precise."
