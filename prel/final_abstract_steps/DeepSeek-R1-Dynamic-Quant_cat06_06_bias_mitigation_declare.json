    "Text": "Potential Bias Identification:\n- For instance, a FinalDecision like \"Reject\" might happen more often after an activity related to sensitive attributes (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) without proper checks in between. This could lead to biased outcomes against minority applicants.\n- Also, if there's a decision step specific to a sensitive group (Approve_Minority), maybe it should require a ManualReview to ensure fairness."

    "Text": "Now, thinking about the constraints needed:\n\n1. Coexistence Constraints: If certain decisions involving sensitive attributes are made, they must coexist with ManualReview activities. For example, if \"Reject_Minority\" occurs in a trace, then \"ManualReview\" should also be present. So adding coexistence entries where these decision steps require ManualReview.\n\n2. Response or Succession Constraints: To prevent a biased sequence like CheckApplicantRace -> Reject without an intermediate check. We can use response constraints that say if CheckApplicantRace occurs, there must be a BiasMitigationCheck before any decision (Approve/Reject). Alternatively, succession could enforce that after CheckApplicantRace, the next step isn't a decision unless BiasMitigationCheck happens first.\n\n3. Non-succession Constraints: Directly preventing sensitive attribute events leading to decisions without checks. For example, noncoexistence or nonsuccession between CheckApplicantRace and Reject would stop them from occurring in succession."

    "Text": "Constraint 1 (Coexistence for Scrutiny): If a potentially biased decision is made (e.g., Reject_Minority), ensure a ManualReview also happens. This adds a layer of human oversight for potentially sensitive cases.\nConstraint 2 (Preventing Direct Biased Succession): Prevent a sensitive attribute check (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) from being immediately followed by a negative decision (Reject) without an intermediate step.\nConstraint 3 (Mandatory Mitigation Step): If a sensitive attribute is checked, ensure a mitigation step occurs *before* the final decision. We can use 'response' for this: If CheckApplicantRace occurs, then BiasMitigationCheck must eventually follow."

    "Text": "Rationale Summary:\n*   `coexistence` between `Reject_Minority` and `ManualReview`: Ensures extra scrutiny for rejections potentially linked to minority status.\n*   `nonsuccession` between `CheckApplicantRace`/`CheckApplicantGender` and `Reject`: Prevents immediate rejection right after checking sensitive attributes, forcing an intermediate step or delay.\n*   `response` from `CheckApplicantRace`/`CheckApplicantGender` to `BiasMitigationCheck`: Mandates that if sensitive attributes are checked, a specific bias check activity must occur later in the process trace before a final decision can be validly made according to this fairness-enhanced model."
