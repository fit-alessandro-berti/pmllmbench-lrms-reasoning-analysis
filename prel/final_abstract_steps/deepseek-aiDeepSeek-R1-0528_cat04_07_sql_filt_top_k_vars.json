Actually, DuckDB does support grouping by arrays, but let's be cautious: we can use a string). We'll use a delimiter that is unlikely to appear in the activity names, e.g., '~' or just use no delimiter? But if we use no delimiter, then sequences like ['A','B'] and ['AB'] would be the same.

We can use ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC and then LIMIT K? But note: what if there are ties? The problem says top K variants by their frequency. We'll assume we break ties arbitrarily? Or we can use RANK and then include all variants that are in the top K ranks? But the problem says top K meaning the K most frequent. So if we have ties at the K-th place, we might get more than K. The problem does not specify. We'll assume we want exactly K, so we break ties arbitrarily? Actually, the problem says the top K variants, meaning the K most frequent. So if there is a tie at the K-th place, we might have to include all? But the problem does not specify. However, note that the requirement says Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants. So if we have more than K variants because of ties, that's acceptable? But the problem says top K, meaning we want exactly K? Let me re-read: determine the top K variants by their frequency. We'll use RANK and then take all variants that have a rank <= K? But then we might get more than K. Alternatively, we can use DENSE_RANK? Actually, we can use the LIMIT clause with ties? DuckDB supports WITH TIES in LIMIT? Actually, DuckDB does support FETCH FIRST K ROWS WITH TIES but only if we specify an ORDER BY and then use WITH TIES. However, we are going to use a window function? Alternatively, we can do: WITH ranked_variants AS ( ..., ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as rn ) and then take rn <= K -> this gives exactly K rows (if there are at least K) but breaks ties arbitrarily. But if we want to include ties, we can do: DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY frequency DESC) as dr and then dr <= K? But note: DENSE_RANK would assign the same rank to ties, so if the top frequency has 10 variants, then they all get rank 1, then next distinct frequency gets rank 2, etc. So if we take dr<=K, we might get more than K variants? Actually, that's what we want: we want all variants that are in the top K by frequency? But note: the problem says top K variants, meaning the K most frequent. However, if there are ties, we might have more than K. The problem does not specify. Since the problem says the top K variants, I think we should return exactly K variants? But then we break ties arbitrarily? The problem does not specify how to break ties. We'll assume we break ties arbitrarily and take exactly K. So we use ROW_NUMBER. Alternatively, we can use: ORDER BY frequency DESC, variant  -- but variant is a string, so we can break ties by the variant string? But that would be arbitrary. Actually, the problem does not specify, so we can choose arbitrarily. However, note: the problem says top K variants by their frequency, meaning we order by frequency (descending) and then take the first K. So we can use: ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC LIMIT K But this will break ties arbitrarily? Actually, DuckDB's LIMIT without WITH TIES will return exactly K rows, even if there are ties? So if the K-th row has the same frequency as the next row, we skip the next row? That might not be what we want? The problem says top K variants by their frequency, meaning we want the K most frequent. So if there are ties at the K-th place, we should include all? But then we exceed K. The problem does not specify. We'll follow the specification: we want exactly K variants? Or we want all variants that are in the top K frequencies? Since the problem says the top K variants, I think we want exactly K. So we break ties arbitrarily? But note: the problem does not specify a tie-breaker. We can break ties by the variant string? Or by the first case_id? Actually, we don't care. We'll use ROW_NUMBER and then take the top K rows. However, the problem says by their frequency, so we are ordering by frequency. We can break ties arbitrarily? Let's do: ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC, variant   -- variant is the string, so we break ties by the variant string? But that doesn't make sense. Alternatively, we can break ties by the min(case_id) or max(case_id)? Actually, we don't need to. We can just use: ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC and then LIMIT K -> which will pick arbitrarily? Actually, without an order on the second column, the order of rows with the same frequency is arbitrary. So we might get different results on different runs? But we don't care as long as we get K. Alternatively, we can break ties by the variant string to have deterministic results? Let's do: ORDER BY count(case_id) DESC, variant Then we get the same result every time."
