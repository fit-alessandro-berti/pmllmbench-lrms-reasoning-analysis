So maybe 'Measure weld integrity' is part of Assembly as an inline check before moving to the next step? Or is it part of a separate Quality Inspection phase?"

    "Text": "Alternatively, during assembly, include that measurement as part of assembly since it's verifying that step's success before proceeding?
