    "Text": "First, I need to carefully analyze the temporal_profile dictionary. The suspicious points jump out immediately: For ('R','P') with 90000 seconds (25 hours) average and only 3600 seconds STDEV (1 hour), that's way too tight. Real business processes don't have approvals happening within 1 hour of submission - that screams automation or fake data. Then ('P','N') at 7 days average with 2-day STDEV is wild. Why would notification take 7 days on average? That's longer than most claim processes. And the high STDEV suggests some notifications are happening in hours while others take weeks - probably a backlog issue. The ('A','C') pair at 2 hours average is worrying because the process should have Evaluate and Approve steps before Close. If claims are closing right after assignment, someone's skipping steps. And ('E','N') at 5 minutes? That's impossible in real life. Even if the system auto-notifies, it wouldn't take 5 minutes to send an email. This must be a data error."

    "Text": "Now for hypotheses: For R->P: Could be an automated approval system for low-value claims, or maybe the timestamps are all set to the same time. But the low STDEV is the red flag. For P->N: Definitely a backlog - maybe the notification team is overwhelmed, or the system only sends notifications weekly. The high STDEV suggests inconsistent processing. For A->C: This screams claim fraud - someone closing claims without proper evaluation. Or maybe the system has a bug where Close gets triggered prematurely. For E->N: 5 minutes is physically impossible for human interaction. Likely either timestamp errors or the activity codes are misassigned."

For P->N, I'll look for cases exceeding 3 days. For A->C, I'll check if there's no E or P activity between A and C. And for E->N, I'll filter out anything under 30 minutes."

For P->N, the model's 7 days average is already too long, so I'll look for cases over 3 days to flag the extreme delays. mental note Must not mention the model's STDEV in the SQL - just use the average as reference.
