    "Text": "First, I need to identify all the main steps mentioned across the interviews. Mary (AP Clerk) describes receiving invoices by email, checking for PO numbers, logging into system, sending to Purchasing for confirmation, matching invoice to PO, and then manager approval. Dan (Purchasing) confirms he checks PO details and either approves or requests corrections. Carlos (Manager) says he gets notified after PO matching and does final approval. Rita (AP Supervisor) handles exceptions, and Karen (Supplier Manager) gets involved in discrepancies."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Hmm, I notice some variations in how they describe the flow. Mary says she sends to Purchasing after logging, but Dan mentions getting invoices from AP. Carlos assumes it goes to manager after Purchasing confirmation. Rita talks about exception handling loops. I'll need to reconcile these perspectives."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For the main flow, it seems clear: 1. Invoice received 2. PO check 3. Log into system 4. Purchasing confirmation 5. Invoice-PO matching 6. Manager approval 7. Payment scheduling"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But there are several decision points. The big one is whether PO exists - if not, it goes back to supplier. Then after Purchasing check, if discrepancies exist, it loops back. And manager can reject too. Rita's interview shows a whole exception sub-process for unresolved issues."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should map all roles carefully: - AP Clerk (Mary) handles initial steps - Purchasing Officer (Dan) does confirmation - Department Manager (Carlos) gives final approval - AP Supervisor (Rita) manages exceptions - Supplier Relationship Manager (Karen) assists with supplier issues"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For exceptions, there are multiple paths: - Missing PO: back to supplier - Discrepancies: to Purchasing first, then possibly to Karen or Rita - Manager rejection: back to AP Clerk - Unresolvable issues: to AP Supervisor"

    "Text": "I need to watch for inconsistencies. Mary says system sends manager approval email, but Carlos says he gets system notification - that's consistent. Dan says he tells Mary to get PO if missing, which matches Mary's description. Rita clarifies that exception handling feeds back into normal flow after resolution."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For the textual BPMN description, I'll structure it with: - Start event (invoice received) - Main sequence flow with tasks - Exclusive gateways for decisions - Sub-process for exception handling - Clear role assignments - Artifacts where mentioned - Notes about variations"

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "The tricky part is the exception handling. Rita describes it as a parallel path that eventually rejoins main flow. I'll make it a separate sub-process with its own start (escalation) and end (rejoining normal flow)."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also need to handle the sometimes cases: - Dan mentions Purchasing might contact supplier directly - Carlos says manager rejection is rare - Karen gets looped in for specific issues. I'll use in some cases qualifiers where appropriate rather than making it part of main flow."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For the final output, I'll organize it chronologically with clear gateways, and add notes section for ambiguities like whether Purchasing contacts supplier before or after AP Clerk escalation."
