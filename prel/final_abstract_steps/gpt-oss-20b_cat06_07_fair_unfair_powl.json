    "Text": "But careful: For the XOR node we need an OperatorPOWL object with children [CulturalFitCheckTransition] and [CommunityAffiliationTransition] maybe plus silent transition? Actually no silent needed because both branches are actual activities; but if there is no special advantage path maybe just one child? In unfair model there are two branches: standard cultural fit evaluation vs community affiliation check which gives advantage. So both branches lead eventually into same next step ManagerialReview concurrently via ordering edges from each branch's end node pointing to ManagerialReview node such that both must finish before manager review begins? Actually since it's exclusive choice only one path executed per candidate so only one of those ends will connect to manager review anyway - that's fine because exclusive choice ensures only one chosen path executed per candidate thus only its end node will connect via edge(s) defined accordingly within partial order referencing it individually maybe ambiguous if using same target Node 'ManagerialReview' referenced by both branches' end nodes via .order.add_edge(branch_end_node,target). But since there's exclusive choice inside OperatorPOWL object representing branching itself rather than separate subnodes outside it? Wait how do they represent exclusive choice within POWL?"
