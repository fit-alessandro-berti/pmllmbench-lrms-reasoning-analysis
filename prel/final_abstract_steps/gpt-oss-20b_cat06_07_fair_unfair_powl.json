Actually OperatorPOWL has children list which are submodels themselves e.g., C,S being Transitions objects representing activities inside the xor block. The ordering outside ensures execution flow enters xor block after preceding tasks and leaves after whichever child finishes because its exclusive choice internal logic ensures completion of exactly one child then exit block automatically continuing downstream tasks defined outside via ordering edges from xor block itself not from individual children!"

Wait skip is used as second option meaning choose nothing else continue out-of-block immediately i.e., skip performing C entirely => effectively optional activity C preceded by optional skip alternative means either perform C or do nothing before proceeding further downstream tasks defined outside xor.
