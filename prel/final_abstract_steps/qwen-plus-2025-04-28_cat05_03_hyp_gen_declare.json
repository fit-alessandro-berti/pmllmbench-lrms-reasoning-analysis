    "Text": "Now for the hypotheses possible reasons for these anomalies could be The model was designed to enforce a strict order of events but the rules were not properly aligned For example the precedence for C requires that the claim was received before closing but the noncoexistence for E prevents the claim from being closed after evaluation The model might have been created under the assumption that the sequence is R A E C but the rules were not properly designed to handle the interactions between these steps There might be a misunderstanding in the business requirements For instance the intended process might require that after evaluation the claim can be closed but the models rules are preventing that The model might have been created with the intention of preventing certain actions but the constraints were not properly considered For example the noncoexistence rule for E and C might have been intended to prevent closing after evaluation but the precedence rule for C requires that the claim was received before closing The model might have been updated incrementally and the rules were not updated to reflect the new requirements leading to inconsistencies"
