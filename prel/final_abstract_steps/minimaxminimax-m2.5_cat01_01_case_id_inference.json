Yes consistent. Check events for case3: 3 registration; 6 doctor consultation; 9 surgery preparation; 13 surgery performed; 16 recovery room; 18 discharge."

These have same activity but different patients. So they are clearly separated. One could also consider department attribute: the Register patient events are for two different departments: ER for cases 1 and 2, Surgery for case3. That also helps."
