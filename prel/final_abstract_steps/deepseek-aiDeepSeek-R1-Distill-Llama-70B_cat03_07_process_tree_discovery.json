Yes, that makes sense because in Case 3, RMI happened twice. So the loop would execute RMI -> VF as many times as needed. So after the loop, we have AD, SC, AC in sequence.

But in the log, Case 3 has two RMIs in a row without VF in between, which suggests that VF isnt done after the second RMI. So perhaps after the loop, VF is done once. Wait, let me look at Case 3 again: Activities in order: RA, VF, AE, RMI, RMI, VF, AD, SC, AC. So after AE, first RMI, then another RMI, then VF, then AD.
