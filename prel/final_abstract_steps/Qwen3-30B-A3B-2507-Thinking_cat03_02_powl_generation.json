However, the example in the problem states: a loop between the sub-models A and B is identified by * ( A, B ) and tells that you execute A, then either you exit the loop, or execute B and then A again So for our case: We want to do BNC first, then optionally D&R (which would then lead back to BNC? but note: the loop structure says after B we go to A again). Actually, the loop structure is: * ( A, B ) meaning: Step 1: execute A (BNC) Step 2: then either exit (so we are done with the loop) or execute B (D&R) and then go back to A (BNC) to repeat. So the loop is: [BNC] -> (if exit: done; else: D&R -> [BNC] again) Therefore, we model the loop as: loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[BNC, DR])"
