Efficient. Insight: Region A is slightly faster for Low Complexity, but both are fast. Complexity seems to be the primary driver, as these are the quickest cases. Group 2: Medium Complexity (Case 2002) Region B. Insight: The Request Additional Documents activity is the biggest delay here. It happened at 14:00, which is 4 hours after the previous step (9:45). Then a gap of 20 hours (4/1 14:00 to 4/2 10:00) before Approve."

Root Cause: Higher complexity leads to more back-and-forth (multiple document requests) and longer processing times. 2. Region: Region A (2001, 2003): 2001 is fast. 2003 is slow. Region B (2002, 2004, 2005): 2004 is fast. 2002 and 2005 are slow. Hypothesis: Does Region B have specific bottlenecks?"

Resource/Bottleneck (Adjuster_Lisa): In Case 2002, there is a 4-hour gap... In Case 2005, she handles multiple document requests... Refining the Resource Analysis: Why is Adjuster_Lisa slow? Case 2004 (Low Complexity): Fast with Adjuster_Lisa. Case 2002 (Medium): Slow with Adjuster_Lisa. Case 2005 (High): Slowest with Adjuster_Lisa. Lets double check the timestamps for 2005 again... Conclusion: Adjuster_Lisa is the primary resource bottleneck."
