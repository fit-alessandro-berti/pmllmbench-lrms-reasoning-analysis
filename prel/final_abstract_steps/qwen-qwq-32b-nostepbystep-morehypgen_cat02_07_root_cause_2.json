Let's see: from 09:05 on the 1st to 11:00 on the 2nd. That's about 23 hours 55 minutes. Wait, maybe I should compute exact time differences. From 09:05 to next day 09:05 is 24 hours, so 23:55 would be 23h55m, so about 24 hours minus 5 minutes. Wait, but the Close is at 11:00 on the 2nd, so total time is (April 2 11:00 minus April 1 09:05). Let me compute that. Let's do it in hours: April 1 09:05 to 24:00 is 14 hours 55 minutes, then from midnight to 11:00 next day is 11 hours. Total is 25h55m? Wait no, maybe better to convert to minutes. Let me do that properly. \n\nAlternatively, maybe using days: April 1st to 2nd is 23h55m until the next day's 09:05, but the close is at 11:00 on the 2nd. Hmm, maybe I should use exact time differences. Let me see:\n\nCase 2002:\nSubmit: 2024-04-01 09:05\nClose: 2024-04-02 11:00\nDifference is 1 day 1h55m, which is 25 hours 55 minutes. That's a long time.\n\nCase 2003:\nSubmit at 09:10 on April 1, Close at 09:30 on April 3. Let's calculate that. From April 1 09:10 to April 3 09:30 is two days and 20 minutes. Wait, two days is 48 hours plus 20 minutes. So that's 48h20m. That's way longer.\n\nCase 2004:\nSubmit at 09:20 on April 1, Close at 10:45 same day. That's 1h25m. That's quick.\n\nCase 2005:\nSubmit at 09:25 on April 1, Close at 14:30 on April 4. Let's see: from April 1 09:25 to April 4 14:30. That's three days minus a bit. Wait, let's compute days and hours:\n\nFrom April 1 09:25 to April 4 09:25 is exactly 3 days, then from 09:25 to 14:30 is another 5h5m. Total is 3 days 5h5m, which is 77 hours 5 minutes. That's a very long time."

But maybe the threshold is cases that take more than a day? Let me see. Case 2001 and 2004 are done in a day. So 2002 (25h), 2003 (48h), 2005 (77h) are the longer ones."

Took 1.5h.\n\nCase 2002: Region B, Complexity Medium. Resources: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Ann, Finance_Carl. The steps here: after Evaluate, they had a Request Additional Documents on April 1 at 14:00, and then the next step was Approve on April 2. So the delay might be between the Request and next steps? Let me check the timeline:\n\nCase 2002 timeline:\n- Submit: 09:05\n- Evaluate: 09:45 (40 mins)\n- Request Docs: 14:00 (took 4h15m since 09:45 to 14:00 is 4 hours 15 minutes? Wait, no. Wait the Request is at 14:00. Wait, the Evaluate was at 09:45, then Request at 14:00, so that's 4h15m between Evaluate and Request? Maybe that's part of the process steps. Then after Request, the next step is Approve on April 2 at 10:00. Wait, the Request was on April 1 at 14:00, then the next activity after that is Approve at 10:00 next day. So between Request and Approve, there's a day and maybe some hours? Let me see the exact time between Request (April 1 14:00) and Approve (April 2 10:00 is 20 hours. Hmm, so that could be a long gap. But perhaps the main issue is the total duration. Anyway, the total is ~25h.\n\nCase 2003: Region A, Complexity High. Resources: CSR_Jane, Adjuster_Mike, Manager_Bill, Finance_Alan. The timeline:\n\nSubmit 09:10 on April 1. Evaluate at 09:40 (30 mins), then first Request at 11:00 (20 mins later?), wait:\n\nWait, the events for Case 2003:\n\n- Submit: 09:10\n- Evaluate at 09:40 (30 mins)\n- Request Docs at 11:00 (20 mins later)\n- Then another Request at 17:00 (6 hours later?), but same day? Wait, the next line is 17:00 same day (April 1?), so between 11:00 and 17:00, another request? Wait, the log shows two Request Docs steps on the same day? Wait the third event is Request Docs at 11:00, then again at 17:00 on April 1. That's same day. Then Approve on April 2 16:00, Pay on April 3 09:00, Close at 09:30. So the timeline is:\n\nAfter the two Requests on April 1, next step is Approve on April 2 at 16:00. The time between 17:00 (last Request) and Approve next day 16:00 is 23 hours. Then Pay is next day at 09:00 (so 17 hours later?), but exact times need to be calculated. But the total duration is from April 1 09:10 to April 3 09:30, which is 2 days and 2 hours 20 minutes, so around 48+ hours.\n\nCase 2005: Region B, Complexity High. Resources: CSR_Paul, Adjuster_Lisa, Manager_Bill, Finance_Carl. The timeline:\n\nSubmit at 09:25, Evaluate at 09:50 (25 mins). Then Request Docs at 11:30 (1h10m later). Then another Request on April 2 17:00 (next day?), but wait, the log shows April 1 11:30, then next activity is another Request on April 2 17:00, then another on April 3 15:00, then Approve on April 4 10:00, Pay on same day 14:00, Close at 14:30. \n\nThe total duration from April 1 09:25 to April 4 14:30 is 3 days and 5h5m.
