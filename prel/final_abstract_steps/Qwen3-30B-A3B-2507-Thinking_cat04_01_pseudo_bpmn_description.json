    "Text": "Wait, the approval step comes after both paths. The XOR for Is Approval Needed? is crucial. For Standard, after Task D (delivery date), it checks if approval is needed.

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For Standard vs. Custom: Standard has parallel checks (AND gateway), so both must finish before moving to delivery date. Custom has a feasibility check (XOR), so it either proceeds to quotation or rejects. The user might confuse why Standard uses AND and Custom uses XOR here—should clarify that parallel checks are simultaneous, while feasibility is a decision point."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For the loop: When approval is denied, it goes back to either the Custom quotation task (E1) or Standard delivery calculation (D). That is important—rework isnt generic; it is context-specific. The user might wonder why it doesnt loop to the start, but the process is designed to fix the specific point that failed."
