    "Text": "Wait, the approval step comes after both paths. The XOR for Is Approval Needed? is crucial. For Standard, after Task D (delivery date), it checks if approval is needed.

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For Standard vs. Custom: Standard has parallel checks (AND gateway), so both must finish before moving to delivery date.
