    "Text": "The XOR operator is used between CheckCredit and skip So the XOR is combining CheckCredit with a silent transition That means if the credit check is done the process skips the silent transition But wait in a normal workflow after checking credit youd probably proceed to approve But here the XOR is making the credit check optional Or maybe the process can skip the credit check if the XOR is active Hmm but the XOR operator usually means that one of the children must be taken So if you have XOR between C and skip then either C is taken or skip is taken But since the process is a partial order maybe the order is such that the credit check is optional That seems odd"
