Actually loop node defined as * (A, B) meaning execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So we need loop where A = AS, B = IQC? But the pattern is: after AS, do IQC; if fails, go back to AS then IQC again. So loop * (AS, IQC) works: start with AS, then optionally loop B (IQC) then A again."

However RT is a separate activity; the loop definition expects B is the loop body executed after A? Actually * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So to model TST then possibly RT then TST again, we set A = TST, B = RT. That matches."

    "Text": "Overall partial order: sequence with concurrency? The description suggests all steps are sequential except optional LB and maybe some concurrency? The log shows no concurrency; but we could model that after PK, LB can be concurrent with DP? Usually labeling is after packaging, before distribution planning. Could be sequential. But we can still model as sequential. Thus root StrictPartialOrder nodes = [OR, MS, QS, loop1, loop2, PK, xorLB, DP, D]. Add edges to enforce order: OR->MS, MS->QS, QS->loop1, loop1->loop2, loop2->PK, PK->xorLB, xorLB->DP, DP->D."
