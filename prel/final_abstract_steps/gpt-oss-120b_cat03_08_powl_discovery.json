Represent as * (AS, IQC) where A is AS, B is IQC? Actually loop node defined as * (A, B) meaning execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So we need loop where A = AS, B = IQC? But the pattern is: after AS, do IQC; if fails, go back to AS then IQC again. So loop * (AS, IQC) works: start with AS, then optionally loop B (IQC) then A again. However we also need the initial AS before loop? In the example, they used loop = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[A, B]) where A is first part, B second. So we can have loop1 = * (AS, IQC). But note that after loop, we go to testing."

However RT is a separate activity; the loop definition expects B is the loop body executed after A? Actually * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So to model TST then possibly RT then TST again, we set A = TST, B = RT. That matches."
