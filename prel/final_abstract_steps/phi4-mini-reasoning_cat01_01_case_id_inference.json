Each case should represent a patients journey through various departments and activities until theyre discharged. The key is to find sequences where each event logically follows the previous one for the same patient. First, looking at the timestamps, they are in order from 08:05:13Z to 08:40:13Z on March 15, 2024. So events are ordered by time. Each case should have a continuous timeline without gaps or jumps that dont make sense in a patients treatment path."

Alternatively, another approach: Each time a new department appears after an activity that suggests next step. For example, from Initial triage to Doctor consultation: likely same patient if theyre assessed and then seen by doctor. But the departments differ (ER vs Surgery). So maybe: Case1: Events4-5  Initial triage in ER for age45 M handled by different nurses. Then Doctor consult with Dr Lee in ER dept? No, event6 is in Surgery dept. So after ER assessment (triage), he gets referred to Surgery department. Then X-ray imaging in Radiology (event7) as part of the surgery process. Lab test requested in ER event8  perhaps a mistake here; maybe its supposed to be Laboratory department but data shows ER. Then Prescription created by Dr Smith in ER event14, and discharge via Ward Clerk in ER event15. Thus, Case A: Age45 M includes events1 (ER register),4/5 (triage steps),7 (X-ray Radiology),8/Lab test req err (but maybe Laboratory?),14 (prescription),15 (discharge). But this is speculative.
