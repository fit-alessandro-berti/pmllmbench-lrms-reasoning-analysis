    "Text": "First, I need to count the number of events per case_id. That's straightforward using COUNT(activity) grouped by case_id."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "But how do I then filter out the ones with counts greater than six? Maybe a subquery where I calculate these counts and then join back to the original table to include only the cases that meet the criteria."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, step 1: create a temporary view or use a subquery that groups by case_id and calculates the count. Then, in the main query, select from event_log but only where the corresponding case_id has a count <=6. That should work."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, another approach could be using a window function to calculate the row number within each case partitioned by case_id, ordered by timestamp (or some other column), then filter rows where row_number() <=6 for each case. But that might not directly solve the problem because it would only select up to six events per case, but we need all events from cases with total <=6."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Hmm, yes. The window function approach would truncate cases longer than 6 events by selecting only their first six entries, which isn't what's needed here. So back to grouping and counting."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the plan is: 1. Calculate counts per case_id. 2. Join this count with the original table where the count <=6. 3. Select all columns from the event_log that meet this condition."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Let me write out the SQL steps. The subquery would be something like: SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id Then join this back to the main table on case_id and where cnt <=6. So the full query would look like: WITH counts AS ( SELECT case_id, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e JOIN counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id AND c.cnt <= 6; That should work. Let me check if there's a more efficient way or any potential issues. DuckDB is good with CTEs, so this approach is fine. The key is to use the window function correctly and ensure that all events from valid cases are included."
