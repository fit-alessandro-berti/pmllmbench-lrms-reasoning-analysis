    "Text": "I observed that distinct changes in parameters like Temperature, Vibration, Material Flow, and Tool Position correlate with shifts between manufacturing activities in the event log. For instance, high temperature and vibration with material flow suggested metal cutting, while higher temperature but no material flow suggested welding."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Using known relationships between parameters and activities (e.g., increased temperature and vibration indicate cutting or welding), I deduced that Events 4-6 corresponded to Cutting Metal due to sustained high temperature and material flow with tool movement."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I inferred that Event 9 represented Welding because of its unique spike in temperature (80Â°C) and energy consumption (5 kWh) while maintaining a stationary tool position and zero material flow. Welding involves high localized energy and heat, fitting these parameters."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Based on trends across multiple observations, I generalized that sequential temperature decreases, low vibration, and tool movement (15mm to 20mm in Events 7, 10-12) aligned with Assembling Parts. Reduced material flow further supports that parts were stationary during this phase."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I cross-checked identified phases against common manufacturing activity expectations: Cutting Metal involves high material flow, Welding features high temperature and energy with no material flow, and Assembling Parts involves tool movement and steady energy consumption."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "To identify Event 13 as Quality Inspection, I applied a heuristic that low temperature, vibration, and energy typically signify diagnostic or inspection phases."
