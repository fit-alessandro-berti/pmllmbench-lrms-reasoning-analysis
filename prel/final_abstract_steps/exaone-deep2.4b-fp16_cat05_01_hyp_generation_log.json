Since Validate Stock is needed before confirming shipment to ensure stock availability. So confirming shipment too early could lead to stock shortage. This is an anomaly. 2. Case 1004: Confirm Shipment event (24) has shipment_scheduled=N, meaning it wasnt scheduled. But was the shipment actually sent? The Ship Goods event for 1004 is at 09:50. So maybe the confirmation was that it wasnt scheduled, but they still shipped it. That could be an anomaly if theres a policy against shipping without a scheduled shipment. Or maybe the system allowed it because of an emergency. Need to check the business rules. 3. Case 1003: Confirm Shipment (event 19) has late_confirmation=Y, which might indicate a delay in confirmation, but maybe the system should flag late confirmations as potential issues.

    "Text": "Hypotheses: For case 1002s early shipment confirmation: Possible causes include a system error where the confirmation logic didnt check stock availability, or manual error in the workflow process where someone approved shipment without validating stock first. Alternatively, the credit check might have failed, but the system still allowed shipment (but in the data, the credit check for 1002 was done before, so maybe thats okay). Alternatively, maybe the workflow process allows for exceptions under certain conditions. For case 1004s shipment without scheduled confirmation: If the business requires shipments to be scheduled in advance, then this is an anomaly. The hypothesis could be that the system allows immediate shipments without scheduling, which might violate policies. Or perhaps the shipment was an exception (e.g., emergency), but the event log doesnt capture the reason. For case 1004s resource mismatch in Confirm Shipment event: The resource is the Logistics Manager, but the actual action was performed by the warehouse clerk. This could indicate data entry error in the event log, or maybe the manager was involved in the process but the primary resource is the clerk. Need to check the schemas definitions. The resource field in order_event_log is the person performing the action. So if the manager is the one confirming, but the actual shipment is done by the clerk, thats inconsistent. Maybe the event should have the clerk as the resource for that event."
