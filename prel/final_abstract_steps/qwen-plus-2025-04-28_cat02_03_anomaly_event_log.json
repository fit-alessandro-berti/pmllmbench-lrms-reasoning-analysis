So this case has an invoice received before the PO was issued. Thats an anomaly... Then, the next activity is Release Payment at 08:00 after the invoice received. But the invoice was received before the PO was issued. So thats a problem... Approve Purchase Requisition at 08:00... this activity is at 07:15, which is before the PR was created. Thats a problem... Because the approval should happen after the PR is created... So the approval is done before the PR was created. Thats not possible. So thats an anomaly."

So this is an anomaly. Case 1002: Invoice received before the PO is issued. Thats a problem because the vendor should receive the invoice after the purchase order is issued. So this is an anomaly. Case 1002: Approval of PR before the PR is created. Thats impossible. The approval should come after the PR is created. So thats an anomaly. Case 1002: Release Payment after the invoice is received before PO is issued. Since the invoice is received before the PO is issued, the payment should be released after the PO is issued. So this is also an anomaly. Case 1004: Receive Goods before the PO is issued. Thats a problem because goods should be received after the PO is issued. So thats an anomaly."
