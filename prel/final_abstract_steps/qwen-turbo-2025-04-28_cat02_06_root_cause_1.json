    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So the root causes could be 1 Escalations leading to longer processing times For example when a ticket is escalated it might take time for the Level2 team to get involved and then they might take longer to resolve 2 Long waiting times between activities For example in Case 102 after escalation theres a 25h gap before investigation starts In Case 104 35h between assign and investigate In Case 105 after escalation theres a 28h gap before investigation These gaps could be due to lack of resources poor coordination or delays in handover 3 Delays in the investigation phase In Cases 102 and 104 the time between investigation and resolution is very long Maybe the agents are not working on the tickets promptly or the issues are complex requiring more time 4 Multiple escalations or backandforth between levels Case 105 had an escalation and then another investigation which might indicate that the initial investigation wasnt sufficient leading to repeated steps"

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Recommendations could include Streamlining the escalation process to ensure quick transfer to Level2 teams perhaps with SLAs for response times Monitoring and reducing waiting times between activities maybe by setting time limits for each step Training Level1 agents to handle more issues to reduce the need for escalations Improving communication between teams to avoid delays in handover Implementing automated alerts or reminders for pending tasks to prevent them from being overlooked Analyzing the reasons for repeated escalations like in Case 105 to address underlying issues"

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
