This looks like a cutting operation (high vibration and temperature). So label Cutting."

Could be assembly or welding? But high pressure maybe for welding? But temperature lower than cutting but still high relative? Actually welding would have high temperature >80 C maybe? Let's see event9 shows temp80 , vibration50Hz but no flow (material flow=0). That could be a quality inspection or final check? Wait event9 has temp80 , high vibration50Hz but no material flow and tool position stays at15mm. Energy spikes up to5kWh."

    "Text": "Phase D: Welding / Heat Treatment (?) Actually Event9 shows high temp80 and high vib50Hz but no material flow - could be 'Welding' because it uses heat and energy but not moving parts? But typical welding would involve movement of torch etc., might produce vibrations too. However the sensor reading shows no material flow which might indicate that the machine is not feeding new material during weld - just heating existing part with torch moving along path maybe not captured as 'flow'. So yes Welding."

    "Text": "Alternatively Phase D could be 'Quality Inspection' because after welding you inspect for defects using sensors that detect vibrations due to ultrasonic testing etc., but there is still high temperature though? But we can interpret Event9 as 'Quality Inspection' due to ultrasonic test requiring high frequency vibrations (~50 Hz) while measuring surface integrity without moving materials -> so no material flow."
