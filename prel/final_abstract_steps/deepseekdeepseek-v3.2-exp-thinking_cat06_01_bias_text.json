    "Text": "The process description reveals two clear bias injection points: the automated geographic/community boost and the manual underwriter discretion. The first is particularly concerning because it is systematic and hidden, while the second involves human subjectivity. Both ultimately favor the same demographic."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should structure the analysis by separating where bias occurs from why it is problematic. The geographic preference creates a feedback loop that disadvantages newcomers, while the discretionary element lacks transparency. The legal distinction between protected vs non-protected characteristics is key here - just because something is not legally prohibited does not make it equitable."
