Looking at the process, Idea Generation (IG) is the starting point, so IG must exist. Similarly, Final Launch (FL) is the end, so FL must exist. Ill set their support to 1.0 and confidence to 1.0 since they are mandatory. Next, absence is for activities that should never happen. In this case, I dont see any activities that are prohibited, so Ill leave this empty. Exactly_one refers to activities that must occur exactly once. Here, IG and FL each happen once, so Ill include them here with support and confidence of 1.0. Init specifies activities that start the process. Clearly, IG is the initial activity."

    "Text": "Now for the pairwise constraints. For response, if one activity happens, another must follow. For example, IG should be followed by DD, so (IG, DD). Also, after AG, MP should happen, so (AG, MP). Similarly, MP should be followed by FL, so (MP, FL). Precedence means that one activity must come before another in every case. So, DD must come before TFC, CE, PC, etc. Also, AG must come before MP and FL. Succession is similar to response but doesnt require the target to immediately follow. So, after IG, eventually DD happens, and so on for the other activities in sequence."

    "Text": "Altresponse is for alternative responses. For example, after DD, either TFC or CE can happen, but not both. So, (DD, TFC) and (DD, CE) with support 0.5 each. Altprecedence would be alternatives in precedence. Im not sure if this applies here, but perhaps after DD, either TFC or CE can come first, so (TFC, CE) and (CE, TFC) with support 0.5 each. Altsuccession is about alternative sequences. So, after DD, TFC and CE can happen in any order. Similarly, after those, PC can happen once both are done. Chainresponse is when a series of activities must follow in order. So, IG -> DD -> TFC -> ... -> FL. Chainprecedence would be about the entire chain needing to happen in order, but I think chainresponse covers that."

    "Text": "Noncoexistence means that certain activities cannot occur together. For example, you cant have both TFC and CE without PC following, but Im not sure. Maybe some other pairs, but I dont see clear noncoexistence here, so Ill leave it empty. Nonsuccession means that one activity cannot be followed by another. I dont see such cases, so Ill leave it empty. Nonchainsuccession is about sequences that cannot happen. Again, not applicable here, so Ill leave it out."
