    "Text": "The task is to create a temporal profile as a Python dictionary for a supply chain process in manufacturing high-tech electronics. Each entry in the dictionary should be a pair of activities (as a tuple) mapped to the average time and standard deviation between them. The key point is that we need to consider all pairs that occur in any trace, not just directly consecutive ones."

    "Text": "Now, I need to think about the typical durations between these activities. For instance, Supplier Selection (SS) to Order Placement (OP) probably takes a few days because after selecting a supplier, you need to negotiate terms and place the order. Then Order Placement (OP) to Receive Components (RC) would depend on supplier lead times—maybe a week or two."

    "Text": "Quality Inspection (QI) after receiving components (RC) might take a day or two, but if there are issues, maybe longer. However, the standard deviation here could be high if sometimes inspections are quick and other times require re-orders or more thorough checks."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "But wait, we need to consider all possible pairs, not just the directly consecutive ones. For example, SS to RC would be SSOPRC, so the time would be the sum of SSOP and OPRC. Similarly, OP to QI would be OPRCQI, so average time is OPRC plus RCQI."

    "Text": "Since the problem isn't specific, perhaps we can assume that the time between two activities is the time from the end of the first to the start of the second. But regardless, the key here is that for all pairs of activities that occur in sequence (even non-consecutive), we need to calculate the time between them."
