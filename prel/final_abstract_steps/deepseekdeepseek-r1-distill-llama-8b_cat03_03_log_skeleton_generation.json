For example, RO can happen 0 or 1 times, CA can happen 0 or 1, etc. Depending on the process, some activities might always happen once, others might happen multiple times, but in this scenario, each activity is a step in a linear process, so they might each occur once. But perhaps some can have multiple, like if there are multiple orders being processed, but since its a single order, maybe each activity is once. So Ill set each activity to have {0,1} occurrences, but some might need higher, but for now, lets assume 0 or 1."

    "Text": "Wait, but Im getting confused. Let me clarify: Always before means if the first activity occurs, the second must have occurred previously. So (A, B) means A must come before B. Always after means if the first activity occurs, the second must occur after. So (A, B) means if A occurs, then B must come after. But in the scenario, after receiving the order (RO), you must check availability (CA). So RO must always come before CA, which is alwaysbefore. Similarly, after CA, you reserve items (RI), so CA must come before RI, which is alwaysbefore. After RI, you pick items (PI), so RI must come before PI. So those are alwaysbefore constraints. So for alwaysafter, perhaps its the reverse. For example, if PI occurs, RI must have occurred before, which is already covered by alwaysbefore. So maybe alwaysafter is not needed for these, but perhaps for other pairs."

    "Name": "Validation - NE",
    "Text": "Wait, looking back at the original definition: Always After: If the first activity occurs, then the second activity is executed in one of the following events. So its not about ordering, but about being in the same case after. So for example, if RO occurs, then CA must be in one of the following events. But Im not sure how that translates into pairs. Alternatively, perhaps alwaysafter is about direct dependencies where if A occurs, then B must occur after, but not necessarily immediately. So for example, if RO occurs, then CA must occur at some point after, but not necessarily right away. But in the process, CA is immediately after RO, so thats covered by directlyfollows. So maybe alwaysafter is for cases where the second activity is not necessarily immediately after, but just after. But in our scenario, most are directly followed, so maybe alwaysafter isnt used here."

    "Text": "As for nevertogether, Im not entirely sure which pairs cant coexist. Maybe activities that are in parallel cant happen in the same case. For example, RO cant happen with QC, because RO is the start, and QC is after PI. So perhaps RO and QC cant be in the same case. Similarly, RI and QC. Or maybe CA and QC. Im not certain, so I might leave nevertogether empty or with some examples."
