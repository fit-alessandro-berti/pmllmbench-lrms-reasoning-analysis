There are some pairs that look a bit off, and I need to figure out what might be causing these anomalies and how to verify them using SQL queries."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "'R' to 'P': 90000 seconds is about 25 hours, with a STDEV of 1 hour. That's pretty tight. 25 hours seems long for approval after receiving the claim, and the low STDEV suggests that it's almost always around that time. That might be suspicious. Maybe there's a batch processing happening at specific times, or some automated system that kicks in after 25 hours. But in reality, approvals should vary based on the claim's complexity."

There could be a misconfiguration in the system where claims are automatically closed after assignment.
