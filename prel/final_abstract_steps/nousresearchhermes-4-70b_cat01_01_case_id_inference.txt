Since each registration is a new patient, that might be the starting point for a case. Lets note the register events: 1. Event 1: Register in ER, 45M, private insurance 2. Event 2: Register in ER, 62F, public insurance 3. Event 3: Register in Surgery, 28M, private insurance These are three separate registrations."

Then event 12 is Doctor consultation for 45M in ER, leading to diagnosis, and event 15 is discharge. So this is one case, starting with registration (event 1), triage (4), then consultation (12), and discharge (15)."

Wait, event12s patient is 45M. Then event11 is the lab test completed for 62F, then event12 is a doctor consultation for 62F? Wait, no, event12 is for 45M. Wait, let me check: Event 5: Initial triage for 62F. Then event8: lab test requested for 62F. Then event11: lab test completed for 62F. Then event14: prescription created for 62F. Then event17: patient discharged for 62F? No, event17 is patient discharged for 62F? Lets check event17: department ER, patient_age=62, gender=F, additional_info: followup=pharmacy_pickup. So yes, thats the 62F patient. So events 2,5,8,11,14,17 are the 62F case."

Surgery,28M So all events are covered by these three patients. Each of the three initial registrations (events1,2,3) correspond to the three cases.

        "Text": "For the 45M ER case: Register (1) triage (4) X-ray (7) consultation (12) discharge (15). The timeline is 08:05 08:10 (triage) 08:15 (X-ray) 08:23 (consultation) 08:30 (discharge). That makes sense. Patient comes in, gets triaged, sent for X-ray, then doctor consults and discharges. For the 62F ER case: Register (2) triage (5) lab test requested (8) lab completed (10) consultation (11) prescription (14) discharge (17). Timeline: 08:07 08:12 08:16 08:20 08:22 08:27 08:35. All in order. For the 28M Surgery case: Register (3) consultation (6) surgery prep (9) surgery (13) recovery (16) discharge (18). Timeline: 08:07 08:13 08:16 08:25 08:31 08:40. Also in order. Each case has a logical flow from registration to discharge, with activities in sequence. The departments also align: ER cases stay in ER or related departments (Radiology, Lab for ER patients), while the Surgery case is handled in Surgery and related departments. No overlapping ages or genders between cases except for the 45M and 62F both in ER, but their activities are separate. For example, event7 (X-ray for 45M) is in Radiology, which is separate from the ER departments, but the patient was originally registered in ER. That makes sense as part of their ER case. Similarly, lab tests for 62F (events8 and 10) are in ER and Lab, which is part of her case."
