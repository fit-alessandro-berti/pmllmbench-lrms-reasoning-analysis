That makes sense because you can't approve a requisition before it's created. After that, there's a parallel block that includes creating the purchase order, receiving goods, receiving the invoice, matching the invoice to the PO, and paying the invoice. Then, it closes the case."

For example, you can't pay an invoice before you receive it, and you can't match an invoice to a PO before the PO is created or before the invoice is received. Also, you can't receive goods before the PO is created because the PO is what triggers the purchase."

Receive Invoice 6. Match Invoice to PO 7. Pay Invoice 8. Close Case. After steps 1 and 2, each subsequent step depends on the previous one. So, after creating the PO, you should receive goods, then receive the invoice, match it, pay it, and then close the case."

In some cases, maybe the goods arrive before the invoice, but the invoice can't be processed until it's received.
