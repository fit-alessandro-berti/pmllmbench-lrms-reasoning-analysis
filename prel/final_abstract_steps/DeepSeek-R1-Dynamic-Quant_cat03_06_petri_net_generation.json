Wait, after RDS fires and outputs into re_submit_p, then we need an arc from re_submit_p back to some place that enables DV again. But in this structure, DV's input is post_CR (from CR). So perhaps connecting re_submit_p via a transition or directly? Hmm no: if after RDS fires and puts into re_submit_p, then we need another arc from re_submit_p back to dv_trans. But for that: We can connect re_submit_p as an input to dv_trans. But this would require adding an arc between re_submit_p and DV transition. So when a token is in re_submit_p, DV can fire again. Thus the code would be: petri_utils.add_arc_from_to(re_submit_p, dv_trans, net) Wait no: arcs are from places to transitions or transitions to places. To have DV's input include both post_cr_p and re_submit_p? That way, when either place has tokens, DV can fire. But transitions require all incoming arcs' places to contribute tokens (based on weight). If the transition dv_trans has two incoming arcs: one from post_cr_p, another from re_submit_p.

CA transitions takes from post_fc_p outputs into post_ca_p. Thus, CA can fire once any time there's a token in post_fc_p.
