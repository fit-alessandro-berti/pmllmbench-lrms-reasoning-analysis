They may have different purposes: one checks specific weld quality, the other visually inspects the finished product for defects. So it's better to separate them."

Material Preparation\n   - Events: Retrieve raw metal sheet, Scan barcode, Place metal sheet on table, Align metal sheet, Preheat metal sheet.\n   - Rationale: These events are sequentially executed to prepare the raw material for subsequent processing steps by ensuring correct identification, positioning, and temperature conditioning.\n\n2. Assembly / Welding Operation\n   - Events: Pick up welding tool, Weld corner A, Weld corner B.\n   - Rationale: This group represents the mechanical joining process where components are welded together using spot welds, performed immediately after material preparation.\n\n3. Weld Integrity Check\n   - Events: Measure weld integrity.\n   - Rationale: The sensor check is performed right after welding to verify that the weld meets quality standards before moving on to finishing steps.\n\n4. Surface Finishing\n   - Events: Apply protective coating, Dry coating.\n   - Rationale: After ensuring weld quality, a protective layer is applied and dried to enhance durability and appearance of the product.\n\n5. Final Quality Inspection\n   - Events: Visual check.\n   - Rationale: This final manual inspection confirms that all previous process steps have been successfully executed and meets overall product standards before moving to packaging or shipment."
