    "Text": "Key Issues and Opportunities for Optimization: 1. Turnaround Time: The standard path has parallel tasks which is good, but the custom path may take longer due to manual feasibility analysis and quotation preparation. The approval step can cause delays, especially if it requires multiple iterations. 2. Flexibility for Non-Standard Requests: The custom path might be rigid. 3. Automation Opportunities: Many tasks like credit check, inventory check can be automated. 4. Predictive Analytics: Predict at the beginning whether a request is likely to be standard or custom. 5. Dynamic Resource Reallocation: Assign tasks to the best available resource."

New Gateway XOR with Prediction: Predict Request Type and Feasibility - Use a machine learning model to predict standard or custom, feasibility. Outcomes: High Confidence Standard: Route to standard. High Confidence Custom and Feasible: Route to custom skip feasibility. High Confidence Custom but Not Feasible: Send rejection. Low Confidence: Detailed analysis. 3. Standard Path: Task B1 automated, Parallel Checks automated, Task D automated. 4. Custom Path: If predicted feasible skip B2, else B2 partially automated, then E1 with base automated quotation. 5. Post-Path Handling: Approval gateway automated, Task F asynchronous dynamic assignment, If No approval: Task H Refine QuotationConditions, New Gateway: Is Refinement Sufficient? If Yes to G, If No loop to H or escalate. 6. Task I automated."
