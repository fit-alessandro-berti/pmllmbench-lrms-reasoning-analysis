So pairs like (RO, CA), (CA, RI), (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D). Also, after dispatch, IC happens. So (D, IC). Then IC must happen before RP? Because invoice is sent, then payment is recorded. So (IC, RP). So that's the always_before set.

So the first activity in the tuple is the one that occurs, and the second must have been before. So for example, (CA, RO) means if CA occurs, then RO was before. Which is correct because CA comes after RO. So the Always Before set would be all the pairs where the first is the later activity, and the second is the earlier one. So the pairs are (CA, RO), (RI, CA), (PI, RI), (QC, PI), (PO, QC), (GSL, PO), (D, GSL), (IC, D), (RP, IC)."

    "Text": "Always After: If the first activity occurs, then the second is executed in one of the following events. Hmm, this is a bit vague. Maybe it's a constraint that if A happens, then B must happen after A at some point. But that's similar to Always Before but in reverse. Wait, Always After's definition: if A occurs, then B is executed in one of the following events. So perhaps B must come after A, but not necessarily immediately. So for example, if RO occurs, then CA must come after. But since RO is the first, CA must come after. So (RO, CA) would be in Always After. But in the scenario, the process is strictly sequential, so all activities after RO must come after RO. So Always After would include (RO, CA), (RO, RI), ..., (RO, RP), (CA, RI), (CA, PI), ..., etc. But that's a lot. However, perhaps in the scenario, the Always After constraints are not necessary because the Always Before and Directly-Follows already enforce the order. So maybe Always After is empty here. Or perhaps it's used for non-immediate dependencies. For example, if there's a constraint that after RO, IC must happen eventually, but that's already covered by the sequence. So maybe in this scenario, Always After is not needed. So perhaps the Always After set is empty. So I'll proceed under the assumption that Always After is empty."

For example, IC and RP: once the invoice is sent (IC), the payment is recorded (RP) after payment is received. But they can't happen at the same time. Wait, but in the process, IC happens after D, and RP after IC. So they are sequential. So maybe there's no Never Together constraints here. Unless there's an activity that's optional and can't be done if another is done. But the problem statement doesn't mention any such constraints. So Never Together set is empty."

Except maybe IC and RP, which depend on payment. Wait, the scenario says when a new customer order arrives, so presumably, each case is a single order. So RO occurs exactly once. Then CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D each once. Then IC happens once (after dispatch), and RP once (after payment). But what if the payment isn't received? Then RP wouldn't occur. But the problem statement says complex order fulfillment process, which might imply that all steps are mandatory. Or perhaps IC and RP are optional. The problem statement doesn't specify, so we have to make assumptions. Assuming that all activities must occur exactly once per case. So activ_freq would be each activity mapped to {1}."

For example, if an order has multiple items, maybe PI or QC could happen multiple times. But the problem statement doesn't mention that. The activities are listed as steps in the process, implying a single occurrence per case. So I'll assume all activities have exactly 1 occurrence. So activ_freq is {activity: {1}} for all."
