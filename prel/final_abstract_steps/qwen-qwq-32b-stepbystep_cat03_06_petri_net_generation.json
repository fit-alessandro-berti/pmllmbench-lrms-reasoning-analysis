Similarly, after Fraud Check (FC), if theres a doubt, an In-depth Investigation (II) is done, and this can happen multiple times. So theres another loop between FC and II.

But in Petri nets, conditions like this are typically handled by using silent transitions or by having a split. Since we cant have conditions in the Petri net model, perhaps the AP transition is part of a branch. Wait, but the problem says the claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So in cases where the amount is over the threshold, AP must occur; otherwise, it can be skipped? Or maybe AP is always required but only triggered when the amount is over? Hmm, the problem says must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So if it does, then AP must happen; otherwise, its not needed. So the Petri net needs to model that AP is an optional step that can be taken when needed.

Wait the steps are: After C (customer files), the process steps are: 1. Claim Registration (CR) 2. Document Verification (DV)   - If incomplete, loop back to RDS (Re-Document Submission), then back to DV again. So the DV must be done again after RDS, which might again lead to RDS again?

Similarly, after FC (Fraud Check), if theres a doubt, then In-depth Investigation (II) is done, and then back to FC again? Or after II, it might loop back to FC again? The problem says This can happen multiple times before proceeding to Claim Assessment (CA). So for the Document Verification (DV) step: after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again. So the loop is between DV and RDS. So the structure would be: after DV, theres a transition to RDS, then back to DV, forming a loop until documents are okay. Similarly for FC and II.

    "Text": "Let me try to model the RDS loop: The DV transitions output is p_DV_out. The RDS transition requires that after DV, if RDS is needed, the token goes through RDS and then back to the input of DV, so that DV can be fired again. So the input of DV is the place before DVs firing. Lets call the input of DV as p_DV_in. Wait, the initial input for DV is the place after CRs output. Wait, starting from the beginning: Start place (p_start) has a token in im. p_start  transition CR  p_CR_out. p_CR_out  transition DV  p_DV_out. At p_DV_out, the token can either go to RDS (if needed), or to FC. Wait, no. The problem says that if the documents are incomplete after DV, then RDS is done, then back to DV again. So the loop is that after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again, until the documents are complete (so that the next time, the process can proceed to FC). To model this loop, the RDS and DV steps must form a loop. So after DV, the token is at p_DV_out. From p_DV_out, there are two transitions: - RDS (Re-Document Submission), which would take the token and loop back to DVs input place, so that after RDS, the process goes back to DV again. - The other option is to proceed to FC. Wait, the RDS transition would have to go back to the input of DV. So: p_DV_out has two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC (wait, no, FC is not the next step until after the RDS loop is done. Wait, the next step after the RDS loop is FC. Wait, the RDS is part of the loop. So after DV, if RDS is needed, then after RDS, the process must loop back to DV again. Wait, perhaps the structure is: After DVs output place p_DV_out, the token can choose to go to RDS, which leads to a place p_RDS, which then connects to the input of DV (so that DV can be fired again), or proceed to FC. Wait, to allow the loop, the RDS transitions output place must arc back to the input of DV. Wait, let me draw it step by step: - After DVs transition, the output place is p_DV_out. - From p_DV_out, the RDS transition is possible. - After RDS, the transition RDS leads to a place p_RDS_out. - p_RDS_out needs to connect back to the input place of DV (the place that feeds into DVs input. Wait, the input of DV is p_DV_in which is p_CR_out (since its the place after CRs output, which is p_CR_out. Wait, the input of DV is p_CR_out, but after DV is fired, the input place (p_DV_in) is consumed. Wait perhaps the loop requires that after RDS, the token goes back to the input of DV (p_DV_in). Wait, the DV transition consumes the token from its input place (p_DV_in) and produces a token in p_DV_out. So, to loop back, after RDS, the token must be placed back into p_DV_in, so that the next time, DV can fire again. So the RDS transition: The RDS transition would need to have an input place p_DV_out and output p_RDS_out. Then, from p_RDS_out, theres an arc to p_DV_in (the input place of DV). Wait but in Petri nets, each transition consumes tokens from its input places and produces tokens in output places. Wait, lets try to model the RDS loop: The loop between DV and RDS must allow multiple iterations. Let me try to model the RDS loop as follows: - After DV (transition), the output is p_DV_out. - From p_DV_out, the token can choose between two transitions: RDS or FC.

    "Text": "Now, for the AP step (Approval): AP is required only if the compensation amount exceeds a threshold. Since Petri nets cant conditionally choose, perhaps the AP transition is optional, meaning theres a choice to take it or not. Wait, but the problem states that AP is required only when the amount is over the threshold. Since the Petri net doesnt have conditions, maybe the AP is a transition that is optional but can be chosen. But according to the problem statement, the AP must be done when needed. But since in Petri nets, all paths must be allowed, perhaps the model allows skipping AP when not needed, but in reality, the process requires it when needed. However, the problem says its a must when the threshold is exceeded. Since we cant enforce that, perhaps the model allows both paths, but the user (or another part of the system) would decide when to take the AP path. Wait, but the problem says must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So the Petri net must allow for both paths, so the model must have that choice. Therefore, after CA, the token is at a place which has transitions AP and the next step (the one that goes to P). Wait, the next step after CA is AP (if needed) followed by P, then N, CL. Wait, the steps after CA are: If AP is needed: CA  AP  P  N  CL. Else: CA  P  N  CL. Therefore, after CA, theres a decision point. So, the transition CA leads to a place p_CA_out. From p_CA_out, there are two outgoing transitions: AP and (a transition that skips AP, maybe a dummy transition? Or the AP path must be taken when needed. Since in Petri net terms, the place after CA must split into two paths: one going through AP and one not. Wait, but the problem says must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So whenever the amount is over, the AP must be taken. But in the Petri net, the model must allow both paths, so the user can choose. The Petri nets final marking is the end, so the path must eventually reach the final marking. Alternatively, the AP transition is optional, but in the Petri net, its allowed to be taken or not. But the problem requires that when the amount is over the threshold, AP must be taken. Since we cant model that, perhaps the model must have AP as a possible transition that can be chosen when needed. Therefore, after CA, the token is at a place which has transitions AP and the next step (the one that goes to P). Wait, the next step after CA is either AP or P. Wait, the steps after CA are: If AP is needed: CA  AP  P  N  CL Or if AP is not needed: CA  P  N  CL. Thus, the place after CA (p_CA_out) has two transitions: AP and (direct to P). So the transition for the direct path would be a silent transition (tau) or perhaps a dummy transition, but since transitions are labeled with activity names, perhaps the direct path must be modeled by a choice between AP and skipping it. Alternatively, the transitions after CA are AP and a transition that leads to P without going through AP. So, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and a transition that leads to P. Wait, but the problem says must be approved if the amount surpasses the threshold. So the Petri net must allow both paths, so the model must have that choice. Therefore, in the Petri net, after CA, you can choose between going through AP or not. Now, moving on, the rest of the steps: after the AP (if taken) or not, then the next step is Payment (P), then N, then CL. Now putting this all together. Let me try to list all transitions and their dependencies: Transitions in order (without loops): C (but C is the initial step, perhaps modeled as the start place. Wait, the first step after the start is CR (Claim Registration). Wait, the initial marking (im) has a token in the start place (start_p). Then CR is fired, leading to the next steps. Let me outline all transitions and their order, considering the loops: Transitions: CR, DV, RDS, FC, II, CA, AP, P, N, CL. Wait, but the steps are: The steps are: After CR comes DV. After DV, theres a possible loop of RDS and back to DV until its okay. Then, after DV is cleared (i.e., the loop is exited when documents are okay), then proceed to FC. Then FC may lead to II, loop, then FC again until its cleared. Then CA, then AP (if needed), then P, N, CL. Now, let me start building the Petri net step by step. Starting with the initial place (im is the start, so the initial marking (im) has a token in the initial place (start_p). Then the first transition is CR (Claim Registration), which is the first activity after the start. Wait, the process starts with the customer filing the claim (C), but according to the problem description, the first process step is CR (Claim Registration). So the first transition is CR. Wait the steps listed in the scenario are: After the customer files the claim (C), the first step is Claim Registration (CR). So the processs first transition is CR. Therefore, the initial marking (im) has a token in the start place (place_start). Then CR is fired, leading to the next steps. Let me structure the Petri net step by step, starting with the main flow and then adding the loops. First, the start place (start_p) has the initial token. 1. Start_p  CR (transition CR)  then to a place p_CR_out. 2. p_CR_out  DV (transition DV)  p_DV_out. Now, at p_DV_out, the process can either proceed to RDS or proceed to FC. Wait, no. The problem says that if the documents are incomplete after DV, then RDS is done, then back to DV again. So the loop is that after DV, if incomplete, go to RDS, then back to DV again, until the documents are complete (so that the next time, the process can proceed to FC). To model this loop, the RDS and DV steps must form a loop. So after DV, the token is at p_DV_out. From p_DV_out, there are two transitions: - RDS (Re-Document Submission), which would take the token and loop back to DVs input place, so that after RDS, the process goes back to DV again. - The other option is to proceed to FC. Wait, the RDS transition would have to go back to the input of DV. So: p_DV_out has two outgoing transitions: RDS and FC (wait, no, FC is not the next step until after the RDS loop is done. Wait, the next step after the RDS loop is FC. Wait, the RDS is part of the loop. So after DV, if RDS is needed, then after RDS, the process must loop back to DV again. Wait, perhaps the structure is: After DVs output place p_DV_out, the token can choose to go to RDS, which leads to a place p_RDS, which then connects to the input of DV (so that DV can be fired again), or proceed to FC. Wait, to allow the loop, the RDS transitions output place must arc back to the input of DV. Wait, let me draw it step by step: - After DVs transition, the output place is p_DV_out. - From p_DV_out, the RDS transition is possible. - After RDS, the transition RDS leads to a place p_RDS_out. - p_RDS_out needs to connect back to the input place of DV (the place that feeds into DVs input. Wait, the input of DV is p_DV_in which is p_CR_out (since its the place after CRs output, which is p_CR_out. Wait, the input of DV is p_CR_out, but after DV is fired, the input place (p_DV_in) is consumed. Wait perhaps the loop requires that after RDS, the token goes back to the input of DV (p_DV_in). Wait, the DV transition consumes the token from its input place (p_DV_in) and produces a token in p_DV_out. So, to loop back, after RDS, the token must be placed back into p_DV_in, so that the next time, DV can fire again. So the RDS transition: The RDS transition would need to have an input place p_DV_out and output p_RDS_out. Then, from p_RDS_out, theres an arc to p_DV_in (the input place of DV). Wait but in Petri nets, each transition consumes tokens from its input places and produces tokens in output places. Wait, lets try to model the RDS loop: The loop between DV and RDS must allow multiple iterations. Let me try to model the RDS loop as follows: - After DV (transition), the output is p_DV_out. - From p_DV_out, the token can choose between two transitions: RDS or FC. Wait, but FC is the next step after DV is successful. Wait, to form a loop, the RDS must loop back to the input of DV. So: After RDS, the transition RDS has an output p_RDS_out, which then has an arc to the input place of DV (p_DV_in, which is p_CR_out. Wait, but then after RDS, the token is placed back to p_CR_out, allowing the DV transition to be fired again. This allows the loop. Thus, the loop between DV and RDS would form a loop that can be repeated any number of times, until the process decides to proceed to FC. But how does the process decide to proceed to FC? Wait, the loop can be exited when the documents are complete, so the process can choose to proceed to FC instead of going back. Therefore, the p_DV_out (the output of DV) has two outgoing transitions: - RDS (leading back to the DV loop)  - FC (leading to the next step) Wait, no. The FC transitions input would be p_DV_outs token. But to proceed to FC, the token must be consumed from p_DV_out. Alternatively, the structure is: After DV fires, the token is at p_DV_out. From p_DV_out, the RDS transition can be fired, leading back to the input of DV (so that another DV can fire after that). Alternatively, to proceed to FC, the token must go through FC transition from p_DV_out. Wait, perhaps the FC transitions input is p_DV_out. Wait, this might require that proceeding to FC requires that the transition FC can be taken from p_DV_out. Wait, perhaps the structure is as follows: The place after DV (p_DV_out) has two outgoing transitions:  - RDS (which loops back to the input of DV)  - FC (the next step). Wait, but to allow the loop, the RDS transitions output must lead back to the input of DV. Wait, lets try: - RDS transition has input p_DV_out and output p_RDS_out.  - p_RDS_out has an arc to p_DV_in (the input of DV, which is p_CR_out. Thus, after RDS, the token is placed back into the input of DV (p_CR_out), allowing the DV transition to fire again. Therefore, the RDS loop is formed between DV and RDS. Similarly for the FC and II loop. Now, for the FC and II loop: After FC (Fraud Check), the check may require an In-depth Investigation (II) which loops back to FC again. So, the structure would be: After FCs output place (p_FC_out), the token can choose to go to II (leading to the II transition, which loops back to FCs input, or proceed to the next step (CA). Wait, the next step after FC is CA (Claim Assessment). But if FC detected fraud, then II is done, leading back to FC again. Thus, the FC-FC loop: After FCs output place p_FC_out, the token can go to II (In-depth Investigation) or proceed to CA. The II transitions output leads back to FCs input place (p_FC_in), so that FC can be fired again. Thus, the II loop is similar to the RDS loop. Now, the Approval (AP) step is only required if the amount is over the threshold. After CA (Claim Assessment), which decides the amount. The CA transitions output is p_CA_out. From p_CA_out, theres a choice between going to AP (if needed) or proceeding directly to P. Wait, but the problem says must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So AP is only taken when needed. Thus, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: AP and a transition that skips AP. Wait, but how? Perhaps the AP is an optional transition that can be taken when needed. So the transition AP is optional. Thus, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and (a transition leading to P without taking AP). Wait, but the next steps after CA are either AP followed by P, or directly to P. Wait, the AP is only required when needed. So the Petri net allows choosing between taking AP or not. Therefore, the transitions after CA are: From p_CA_out, transitions are AP and a silent transition? No, each transition must be labeled. Alternatively, the path without AP would require a dummy transition, but the problem requires the transitions to have the activity names. Wait, perhaps the model allows the process to choose either to take AP (when needed) or skip it (when not needed). Thus, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: AP and the transition to P. Wait, but then the path without AP would go to P directly. Alternatively, the AP transition is optional. So the transitions after CA are AP and the next step (P. Wait, but the next step after CA is either AP or P. Wait, the steps after CA are: If AP is needed: CA  AP  P  N  CL Or if AP is not needed: CA  P  N  CL. Thus, the place p_CA_out has two transitions: AP and (direct to P). So the transition for the direct path would be a silent transition (tau) or perhaps a dummy transition, but since transitions are labeled with activity names, perhaps the direct path must be modeled by a choice between AP and skipping it. Alternatively, the transitions after CA are AP and a transition that leads to P without going through AP. So, the place p_CA_out has two outgoing transitions: AP and a transition that leads to P. Wait, but the problem says must be approved if the amount surpasses the threshold. So the Petri net must allow both paths, so the model must have that choice. Therefore, in the Petri net, after CA, you can choose between going through AP or not."
