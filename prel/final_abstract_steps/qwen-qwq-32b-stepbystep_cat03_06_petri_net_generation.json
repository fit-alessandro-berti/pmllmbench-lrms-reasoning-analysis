Wait, but the problem states that AP is required only when the amount is over the threshold. Since we cant model conditions, maybe the AP is a transition that is optional but can be chosen. But according to the problem statement, the AP must be done when needed. But since in Petri nets, all paths must be allowed, perhaps the model allows skipping AP when not needed, but in reality, the process requires it when needed. However, the problem says its a must when the threshold is exceeded. Since we cant enforce that, perhaps the model allows both paths, but in the actual process, the token would only take the AP transition when needed. But since the Petri net must allow all possible paths, perhaps the AP is a transition that can be skipped when not needed. Wait, but according to the problems description, the AP is mandatory when the amount is over the threshold. However, since the Petri net cant model the condition, perhaps the model allows both paths: with or without AP. The user is to decide when to take the AP path. Therefore, after CA (Claim Assessment), which decides the amount), the process must decide between going to AP or skipping it. Therefore, the place after CA has two outgoing transitions: one that goes directly to P (Payment), but thats not correct.

The RDS transition consumes p_DV_outs token, produces a token in p_RDS_out. Then, p_Rds_out has an output arc to p_DV_in (the input of DV, which was p_CR_out. Wait, but after RDS, the process must loop back to the input of DV, so that when the token is back in p_CR_out, the DV can be fired again.
