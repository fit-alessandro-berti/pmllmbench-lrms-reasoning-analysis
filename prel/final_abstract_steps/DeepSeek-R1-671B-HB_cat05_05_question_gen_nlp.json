    "Text": "First, the R&D phase involves designing new models. Then sourcing components from multiple international suppliers with varying lead times and contracts. Manufacturing in Malaysia with 24/7 operations. Logistics involving air and sea freight, customs, and compliance. Distribution centers in different regions using JIT or monthly shipments. Then to retailers, e-commerce, and sometimes direct to consumers. Tracking inventory, sales forecasts, quality assurance, compliance, environmental regulations, recalls, and continuous improvement. Use of digital systems, data analytics, and machine learning."
