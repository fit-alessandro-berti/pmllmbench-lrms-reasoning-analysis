The content is described as follows: \"Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, with columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. A process variant is defined as the ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp. Your task: 1. Construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id, maintaining the order imposed by timestamp. 2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants. 3. Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by frequency (i.e., number of cases following that variant). 4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants.\""

The query should do: - first extract sequences per case (ordered by timestamp) - then group these sequences per variant and count frequency. - Then filter the original table to only show events for cases that are part of top K variants. We have to assume top K is a parameter in our query. There might be a variable K, let's say it's input as \"K\"."

But we want string sequence representation maybe like using group_concat. Possibly use \"string_agg\" or similar. Wait, I'll check what functions are available in DuckDB as of 2023? The latest version may support window aggregation. Alternatively, we can join the aggregated result back to original table."

We have multiple tasks: - Ordered sequence extraction: Use row_number() partition by case_id order by timestamp. - Then group by case_id to get variant string.

Possibly not needed because grouping by case_id will automatically sort by timestamp if group_concat uses \"WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...)\". Yes, the syntax is: group_concat(expression) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY ...) is standard. Alternatively, if using array_agg, then it might require conversion to string.

Double-check: 1. Construct query: variants, grouping by case_id, using group_concat(activity ORDER BY timestamp) returns a string representing the variant sequence. But it's best to use '->' delimiter so that we can see separation of activities? Not required but nice. 2. Then variant_counts counts frequency per variant. 3. top_variants selects variants in top K positions by frequency. 4. Final selection: join event_log and variants on case_id, filtering where v.variant is in the list from top_variants.
