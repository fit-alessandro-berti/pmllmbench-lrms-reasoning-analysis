The content is described as follows: \"Consider an event log stored in a DuckDB table named `event_log`, with columns: case_id, activity, timestamp. A process variant is defined as the ordered sequence of activities that occur in a single case, determined by sorting events within that case by their timestamp.\n\nYour task:\n1. Construct a DuckDB SQL query that determines the sequence of activities for each case_id, maintaining the order imposed by timestamp.\n2. Group cases by their complete activity sequence to identify unique process variants.\n3. Count how many cases correspond to each variant and determine the top K variants by frequency (i.e., number of cases following that variant).\n4. Return all events from the original event log that belong only to cases which are part of these top K variants."
