The description says IQC is an in-line quality check that is repeated if needed. So perhaps the loop is that after AS, you do IQC, and if its not passed, you go back to AS again.

So after TST, if it fails, they do RT, then TST again, and so on until it passes. That seems like a loop between TST and RT. Suppose the loop is * (TST, RT).
