First, let's recall the assumed normal process flow: 1. Register Order (Sales) 2. Perform Credit Check (Finance) 3. Validate Stock (Warehouse) 4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics) 5. Ship Goods (Logistics) 6. Issue Invoice (Finance) 7. Receive Payment (Finance) We'll look for deviations from this flow in the example data."

Confirm Shipment (event 9) occurs before Perform Credit Check (event 11) and Validate Stock (event 12). This is a problem because Credit Check and Stock Validation should happen before shipment. 2. Also, Validate Stock (event 12) occurs after Ship Goods (event 10). This is backward. Case 1003: Anomalies: 1. Ship Goods (event 17) occurs before Validate Stock (which is missing) and before Confirm Shipment (event 19). ... So Validate Stock (which should be step 3) is missing. Also, Confirm Shipment (step 4) is after Ship Goods (step 5) and Issue Invoice (step 6). This is a major deviation. Case 1004: Anomalies: 1. Receive Payment (event 22) occurs before Issue Invoice (event 23) and before Confirm Shipment (event 24). This is impossible because you cannot receive payment before issuing an invoice. 2. Also, the normal flow requires Credit Check and Validate Stock, but they are missing."

Case 1004: The finance team might have mistakenly recorded the payment before the invoice was issued (a data entry error). The system might have a bug..."

Find all cases where the event sequence deviates from the normal flow (i.e., an event that should come after another appears before it). We can do this by ordering the events by timestamp per case_id and then checking the sequence of activities. ... Alternatively, we can check for specific violations: For example, we can check if 'Confirm Shipment' occurs before 'Perform Credit Check' or 'Validate Stock'."
