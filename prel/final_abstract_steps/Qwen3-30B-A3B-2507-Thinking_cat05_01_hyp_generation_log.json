Actually, in the log we have: Register Order (15), Perform Credit Check (16), Ship Goods (17), Issue Invoice (18), Confirm Shipment (19), Receive Payment (20). So Validate Stock (which should be step 3) is missing. Also, Confirm Shipment (step 4) is after Ship Goods (step 5) and Issue Invoice (step 6). This is a major deviation: Ship Goods should be after Confirm Shipment, and Validate Stock should be before Confirm Shipment."

Case 1003: The Validate Stock step might have been skipped due to a system error or a process error (e.g., the warehouse clerk didnt log the event). The system might have a bug that allowed the shipment to be processed without stock validation.

    "Text": "We can do this by ordering the events by timestamp per case_id and then checking the sequence of activities. However, note that the normal flow is fixed. We can create a mapping of the expected order of activities. Lets define the expected order: Step 1: Register Order Step 2: Perform Credit Check Step 3: Validate Stock Step 4: Confirm Shipment Step 5: Ship Goods Step 6: Issue Invoice Step 7: Receive Payment We can create a sequence for each activity and then for each case, check if the sequence of activities (by timestamp) matches the expected sequence. But note: the events are logged in chronological order (by timestamp) so we can sort by timestamp. We can write a query that for each case_id, orders the events by timestamp and then checks if the activity sequence matches the expected sequence. However, the problem is that the expected sequence is fixed. We can use a common table expression (CTE) to assign a sequence number for the expected order, and then for each event in the log, we can get the expected sequence number. Then we can check if the actual sequence (by timestamp) matches the expected. But note: the log might have extra events or missing events. We are only concerned with the order of the required events. Alternatively, we can check for specific violations: For example, we can check if Confirm Shipment occurs before Perform Credit Check or Validate Stock. Similarly, we can check for: Ship Goods before Confirm Shipment or Validate Stock Issue Invoice before Ship Goods or before Confirm Shipment (but note: in the normal flow, Issue Invoice can be after Ship Goods, but in the anomaly of case 1004, we have Receive Payment before Issue Invoice, which is the main issue for that case)"
