Because in a strict partial order, each node can have multiple predecessors or successors? Wait, maybe I need to look at the model again. The StrictPartialOrder in pm4py allows nodes to have multiple predecessors or successors? Or does it enforce a linear order? Wait, StrictPartialOrder in pm4py actually enforces that the graph is a DAG with a strict linear extension. Wait, no, maybe I'm getting confused here."

Screen is connected to Decide and Interview. Wait, but that would mean that Screen must come before both Decide and Interview. But Decide and Interview are separate nodes. So the order could be Post Screen Decide Onboard Payroll Close, but also Screen could go to Interview before Decide? Wait, but the edges are Screen to Decide and Screen to Interview. So in the partial order, Screen must come before both Decide and Interview. But then Decide and Interview can be in any order relative to each other? Because there's no edge between them.

That might be a problem because the decision to hire should involve some process, perhaps including interviews. Alternatively, maybe the model allows branching here. Wait, but the edges are transitions in the POWL model. Wait, maybe the model uses transitions between activities, and the PartialOrder defines the sequence. Wait, perhaps I need to think of the model as a combination of transitions and partial orders. The transitions are separate from the partial order. Wait, the model1 is built with transitions as individual transitions (Post is a Transition node), and then the StrictPartialOrder is adding precedence constraints between the nodes (activities). So the overall process is a combination of the transitions and the partial order. So the transitions are the steps (like Post_Job_Ad is a transition), and the partial order defines the order in which these transitions can occur."

But the presence of the skip here might be part of the control flow. However, using XOR here might not align with standard process logic.

So this violates the standard process logic. 2. The partial order allows Screen to lead to both Decide and Interview. This could mean that after screening, the process can choose to either decide immediately (without interviews) or proceed to interviews.

The use of XOR operators (like xor_payroll) introduces control flow that might not align with the process logic.

The partial order in model2 includes loop_onboarding after Decide. So the process after Decide would go through the loop_onboarding operator, which is a loop between Onboard and skip.
