    "Text": "We are given a temporal profile model that shows average time intervals and standard deviations between pairs of activities The anomalies in the model are 1 (R P) Average time 25 hours 90000 seconds with a very low standard deviation 3600 seconds ie 1 hour This suggests that the time from receiving a claim to approving it is consistently around 25 hours which might be too rigid and not aligned with the typical process that includes intermediate steps like Assign and Evaluate It could indicate an artificial constraint or a system that forces approvals at fixed intervals 2 (P N) Average time 7 days 604800 seconds with a high standard deviation 172800 seconds ie 2 days This indicates that after approval the notification to the customer is often delayed by a week on average but with high variability This might be due to a backlog in the notification step resource constraints or perhaps a batch processing system that sends notifications periodically 3 (A C) Average time 2 hours 7200 seconds with a standard deviation of 1 hour 3600 seconds This pair suggests that sometimes claims are closed very quickly after assignment without necessarily going through evaluate and approve This might indicate premature closures possibly due to errors or a policy of closing claims that are deemed non actionable without full evaluation 4 (E N) Average time 5 minutes 300 seconds with a low standard deviation 60 seconds This is suspiciously quick for a process that should involve evaluation and then notification It might indicate that the notification step is automated and happens immediately after evaluation but without allowing time for necessary checks or documentation Alternatively it could be a data entry error"

    "Text": "Now we generate hypotheses for these anomalies (R P) anomaly Hypothesis The approval step might be scheduled at fixed intervals eg every 25 hours by an automated system which forces the approval to happen at those times regardless of the actual processing This could be due to a batch job or a business rule that limits approvals to specific times (P N) anomaly Hypothesis The notification step is handled manually or through a separate system that has a backlog The high variability might be because some notifications are sent immediately if the adjuster is proactive but often delayed until a weekly report is processed (A C) anomaly Hypothesis Some claims are being closed prematurely possibly due to a business rule that allows closing without full evaluation for certain types of claims eg claims below a certain amount Alternatively it could be an error where the close event is recorded too early (E N) anomaly Hypothesis The notification is an automated email that is triggered immediately upon evaluation However this might bypass necessary steps such as manual review or documentation leading to potential errors Alternatively it could be a data issue where the timestamp for notification is incorrectly recorded"

    "Text": "Next we propose verification approaches using SQL queries We will focus on the claim_events table Verification Queries 1 Identify claims with unusual time intervals For example to check claims where the time from Receive to Approve is outside the expected range say more than 2 standard deviations from the mean of 90000 seconds 2 Correlate anomalies with adjusters or claim types For the (P N) anomaly we can check if the delay is more pronounced for certain adjusters or claim types 3 Check for premature closure after assignment For (A C) anomaly we can look for claims that were closed without intermediate steps like Evaluate and Approve or with a very short time between Assign and Close 4 Check the quick transition from Evaluate to Notify Similarly for (E N) anomaly 5 Check for claims that skip steps For example claims that go from Receive to Approve without an Assign or Evaluate These queries can help verify the anomalies by identifying specific claims that exhibit the unusual timing patterns and then investigating their context like adjuster claim type etc We can then drill down into the reasons for these anomalies"
