That seems a bit off because usually, you wouldn't Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods so quickly after receiving payment."

    "Text": "Looking at the additional info, for case_id 1004, the shipment_scheduled is set to 'N' in the Confirm Shipment event. That's unusual because if shipment_scheduled is 'N', it probably means the shipment isn't scheduled. But then, the Ship Goods event still happens, which suggests that the system might have a bug where it's allowing goods to ship even when the shipment isn't scheduled. That could lead to stock issues or miscommunication with logistics."

    "Text": "Another thing I notice is in case_id 1002. The Perform Credit Check happens after the Confirm Shipment and Ship Goods events. That's the opposite of what should happen. Typically, you'd perform a credit check before processing the order to ensure the customer is creditworthy."
