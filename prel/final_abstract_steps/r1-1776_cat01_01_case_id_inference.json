Event 3 is Surgery for a 28-year-old male. These are likely three different patients since theyre in different departments and have different ages and genders. So maybe three cases here."

Similarly, event 5 is triage for 62F in ER, which would follow event 2s registration. Event 6: Doctor consultation in Surgery for 28M. The registration for Surgery was event 3 (28M), so this could be part of that case."

Also checking timestamps: registration at 8:05, triage at 8:10, X-ray at8:15, doctor consult at8:23, discharge at8:30. That makes sense sequentially. Then the second case (62F): events2(reg),5(triage),8(lab req),10(lab done),11(consult),14(prescription),17(discharge). Timestamps: reg at8:07, triage at8:12, lab req at8:16, lab done at8:20, consult at8:22, prescription at8:27, discharge at8:35. Third case (28M): events3(reg in Surgery),6(doctor consult scheduled knee surgery),9(surgery prep),13(surgery performed),16(recovery),18(discharge from Surgery). Timestamps line up as reg at8:07:15, consult at8:13:00 (soon after registration?), then prep at8:16:45, surgery at8:25:19, recovery at8:31:37, discharge at8:40."

Then event6s timestamp is 08:13:00 (Doctor consultation in Surgery). That seems reasonable; after registering in Surgery dept., he goes to consultation. Then surgery prep (event9) at08:16:45 which is after X-ray and lab requests from other patients but makes sense as part of his flow."

That makes sense after X-ray in Radiology (event7). Then discharged from ER (event15). Yes. The flow would be register -> triage -> X-ray -> doctor consult -> discharge. For the second case (62F): register -> triage -> lab request -> lab completed -> consult with Dr. Smith -> prescription -> discharge. Third case starts with Surgery registration -> doctor consult about scheduled surgery -> prep -> surgery performed -> recovery -> discharge from Surgery dept. Also note that each discharge has different departments: Event15 discharged from ER for 45M, event17 from ER for 62F, event18 from Surgery for 28M. That aligns with their departments during registration."
