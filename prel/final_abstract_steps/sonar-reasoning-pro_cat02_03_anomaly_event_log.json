First, I need to recall the standard P2P steps. From the search results, the typical flow is: 1. Create Purchase Requisition 2. Approve Purchase Requisition 3. Issue Purchase Order (PO) 4. Receive Goods 5. Receive Vendor Invoice 6. Match Invoice to PO (three-way matching) 7. Release Payment 8. Close Case"

    "Text": "Case 1002 has some oddities. The PO is issued before the requisition is approved. Thats a red flag because approval should come before creating a PO. Also, the invoice is received and payment released before goods are received and invoice matched. Thats problematic because payment should only be made after verifying receipt of goods and matching the invoice to the PO and receipt."

    "Text": "Case 1004 has goods received before issuing the PO. That doesnt make sense because the PO is a contract with the supplier; receiving goods without a PO could mean unauthorized purchases. Also, issuing the PO after receiving goods is backwards."
