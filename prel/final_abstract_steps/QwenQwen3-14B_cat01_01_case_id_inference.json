Event 8: Age 62, Female, ER, Lab test requested. Event 9: Age 28, Male, Surgery, Surgery prep. Event 10: Age 62, Female, Lab, Lab test completed. Event 11: Age 62, Female, ER, Doctor consultation. Event 12: Age 45, Male, ER, Doctor consultation. Event 13: Age 28, Male, Surgery, Surgery performed. Event 14: Age 62, Female, ER, Prescription. Event 15: Age 45, Male, ER, Discharged.

The timestamp is 8:10:50, then 8:15:42 for the lab test? Wait, no. Let me check the timestamps: Event 1: 08:05:13 Event 4: 08:07:15 (after event 1's 08:05:13, but event 2 is at 08:07:02. Wait, event 1 is 45M, event 2 is 62F, event 3 is 28M. So event 4 (45M) is at 08:07:15, which is after event 1 (08:05:13). Then event 7 is at 08:10:50 (X-ray), then event 12 (Doctor consultation) at 08:23:10, then event 15 (discharge) at 08:30:05."

The initial registration is in Surgery, which might be because it's a scheduled procedure, not an ER case. Wait, but event3 is a register patient in the Surgery department. That's a bit different from the ER registration. So this patient is probably coming in for a scheduled surgery, hence the Surgery registration. Then the sequence follows through the surgery steps."

The timestamps are close (event4 at 08:07:15 and event5 at 08:12:29). But since their patient attributes differ, they are separate. Similarly, event3 (register in Surgery) is at 08:07:15, which is after event2 (ER register) at 08:07:02. But that's a different patient, so that's okay."
