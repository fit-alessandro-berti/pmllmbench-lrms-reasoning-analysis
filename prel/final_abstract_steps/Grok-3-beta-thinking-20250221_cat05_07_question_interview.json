    "Text": "First I should probably start with the initial contact How does the property owner reach out to the company Is there a specific form or process they follow And what exactly does the property coordinator look for in the documentation Are there common reasons why documentation might be rejected or need updates Then theres the assignment of the property manager That seems important What criteria are used to select the right manager for a property Is there a system or algorithm that helps with this or is it more of a manual decision And how do they handle it if a manager is overloaded or if theres a conflict of interest The introductory meeting between the manager and the landlord sounds crucial What are the typical topics discussed in this meeting Are there any standard policies or templates used or is it customized for each property Next the inspection and photography part How are the photographer and inspector chosen Are they in house or external contractors And what happens if the inspection finds issues Is there a standard process for addressing these or does it vary depending on the severity of the problems The marketing phase involves creating listings and brochures Who is responsible for this Is there a specific team or department that handles marketing for all properties or is it done regionally Then the tenant screening process What are the key factors considered when evaluating tenants How do they handle multiple applications for the same property Is there a scoring system or a set of guidelines that the property manager or leasing agent follows The lease finalization and move in scheduling seem straightforward but I should ask if there are any common issues or delays that occur at this stage Also what happens if a tenant backs out after the lease is signed Finally the quality checks and audits Who performs these and what are they looking for Are there any metrics or KPIs used to evaluate the success of the onboarding process I should also ask about exceptions and how they are handled For example what if a property requires special insurance or has unique lease clauses How does the process adapt to these situations And throughout the process how is communication managed Is there a central system or platform where all interactions are tracked or is it a combination of different tools"
