After that, there's a triage process with an interview and classification. Based on the classification, there's an exclusive choice between two initial diagnostic tests: Comprehensive ECG (CE) or Full Blood Panel (FBP)."

This loop continues until the results are normal."

  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Therefore, the loop body is SC -> treatment -> RDT, and after RDT, decide to exit or redo. In process tree notation, this can be modeled as *(seq, tau), where seq = SC -> X(TM, SPT) -> X(FCE, FBA)."
