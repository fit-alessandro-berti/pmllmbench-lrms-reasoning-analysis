So, actually, the initial test is not part of the loop; it's before the loop. Then, if the initial test is abnormal, you enter the loop: SC -> treatment -> RDT, and repeat until RDT is normal. But wait, there's a subtlety: for the first time, after the initial test, if abnormal, you do SC -> treatment -> RDT, then if RDT is abnormal, repeat SC -> treatment -> RDT, and so on, until RDT is normal. So, in a sense, the loop starts after the initial test, but the initial test is not repeated; only the SC -> treatment -> RDT is repeated. Wait, but in the loop, RDT is the re-diagnostic test, which is similar to the initial test but possibly different. Wait, actually, the initial test is X(CE, FBP), and RDT is X(FCE, FBA), which are follow-up tests. So, they are different activities. Moreover, in the loop, it's SC -> treatment -> RDT, and if RDT is abnormal, repeat SC -> treatment -> RDT, else exit. But for the first time, after the initial test, if abnormal, you do SC -> treatment -> RDT, then check RDT, and so on. So, one way to model this is to have the initial test, then a loop that includes SC -> treatment -> RDT, with the condition based on RDT. But in process trees, since we can't explicitly model conditions, we need to find a structural way. Actually, a common way to model such loops is to have the loop body include the activities that are repeated, and use the loop operator accordingly. In this case, since the initial test is only done once, and then the loop is SC -> treatment -> RDT, repeated until RDT is normal, but actually, the first SC -> treatment -> RDT is triggered by the initial test being abnormal. Wait, perhaps it's better to think of it as: after the initial test, there is a choice: if normal, proceed directly to the next steps, else enter the loop. But in process trees, we don't have conditional choices based on data; we have to model it with operators."

So, in process tree terms, this can be modeled as a loop where the body is SC -> treatment -> RDT, and the loop can be executed zero or more times. Wait, more precisely, it's a loop donde while the condition is true (results abnormal), but since we can't model conditions, we can use a loop with a tau redo. But actually, in many process modeling languages, such loops are modeled with the possibility of zero iterations, but in standard process tree loop operator, it's at least one iteration. Wait, actually, in pm4py, the loop operator *(A, B) typically requires at least one execution of A, since it's execute A, then either exits or executes B and then A again, etc. So, for example, *(A, tau) would mean execute A, then possibly repeat A multiple times. But in this case, if the initial test is normal, we don't want to execute the loop at all. So, to model a loop that can be executed zero or more times, we need a way to skip the loop entirely. In process trees, one way to model an optional loop is to use an exclusive choice between the loop and a tau. For example, X( *(loop_body, tau), tau ), which means either do the loop (possibly multiple times) or do nothing. Yes, that could work."
