Perform Credit Check (Finance) 3. Validate Stock (Warehouse) 4. Confirm Shipment (Logistics) 5. Ship Goods (Logistics) 6. Issue Invoice (Finance) 7. Receive Payment (Finance) So, any deviation from this sequence could be an anomaly."

Normally, Credit Check should come after Register Order. - Case 1003: Sequence: Register Order Perform Credit Check Ship Goods Issue Invoice Confirm Shipment Receive Payment. - Anomalies: Ship Goods before Validate Stock (which isnt even in the log?), and Confirm Shipment after Ship Goods. Validate Stock is missing or out of order. - Wait, in the log: Register Order Perform Credit Check Ship Goods Issue Invoice Confirm Shipment Receive Payment. No Validate Stock. - Case 1004: Sequence: Register Order Receive Payment Issue Invoice Confirm Shipment Ship Goods. - Anomalies: Receive Payment before Issue Invoice? That doesnt make sense. Also, missing Perform Credit Check and Validate Stock."

To find cases where activities are out of order. 2. To check for missing activities in a case. 3. To correlate with order details, like order_value, to see if high-value orders have anomalies. 4. To link with resources to see if certain roles or departments are involved in anomalies."
