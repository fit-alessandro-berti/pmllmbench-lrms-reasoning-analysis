C005 didn't have a community group and no adjustment. That makes me think that being part of the Highland Civic Darts Club gives a bonus."

    "Text": "In the event log, C005 had a PreliminaryScore of 740 without any community adjustment and was approved. So high scores without adjustments can still get approved, but maybe the adjustments help those who are on the borderline. Like C004 went from 690 to 700, which might have tipped them over an approval threshold."

    "Text": "But then why did C003 with 715 get rejected? Maybe there's more to the decision than just the score. Perhaps other factors like debt-to-income ratio or history are considered, but it's still concerning that the score adjustments seem to favor certain groups."

    "Text": "I also wonder about the ManualReview step. Reviewers might have their own biases, but in the log, it doesn't specify their criteria. If reviewers are influenced by community group, that could add another layer of bias."
