    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. So, the task is to write a DuckDB SQL query that identifies certain cases in an event log. The event log is stored in a table called `event_log` with columns `case_id`, `activity`, and `timestamp`. First, I need to understand the requirements clearly. The goal is to find cases where there's a specific sequence of three activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order'. These three must appear consecutively in that exact order within the same case. Also, the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events must be more than 5 days. If a case meets both conditions, we need to exclude it from the final result, meaning we only return cases that don't have such a sequence."
