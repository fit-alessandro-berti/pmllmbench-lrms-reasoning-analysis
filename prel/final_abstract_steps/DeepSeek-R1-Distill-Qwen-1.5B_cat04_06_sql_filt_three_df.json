The goal is to find cases where there's a specific sequence of three activities: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', 'Create Order', and 'Confirm Order'. These three must appear consecutively in that exact order within the same case. Also, the time between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events must be more than 5 days."

    "Text": "Alright, breaking this down into parts. First, the initial part of the query should find all cases where the given sequence of activities occurs in order. So, I need a subquery that checks for the three activities in sequence. I think using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) would be helpful here. The outer query can identify the cases that have the required sequence, and the inner CTE can extract the specific activities in the correct order."

For each case, check if 'Approve Purchase Requisition' is followed by 'Create Order' and then 'Confirm Order' without any other events in between. 3. If the sequence is found, check the time difference between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' activities. If it's more than 5 days, exclude the case. 4. Ensure the final result includes all cases that do not meet the above criteria."

If not, I exclude the case."
