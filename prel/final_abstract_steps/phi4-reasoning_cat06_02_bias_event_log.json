There are multiple cases. We see some events: For C001: ... For C005: ApplicationReceived at 13:00:50; LocalResident = FALSE; CommunityGroup None.

    "Text": "In this process, there appears to be an attribute called CommunityGroup and LocalResident. Cases C001 and C004 are local residents and belong to a specific Community Group (Highland Civic Darts Club). They get an additional score adjustment: +10 in the PreliminaryScoring stage."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The bias manifests in the fact that individuals who are local residents and have a membership in a recognized community group (like Highland Civic Darts Club) get a bonus of +10 points in their scoring. This gives them an advantage over similar applicants who do not belong to such groups, even if their underlying creditworthiness is equal."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Also note that in C002, no bonus adjustment was provided even though the applicant is local resident but with no specific CommunityGroup. However they got approved with a preliminary score of 720. But in C003, the applicant is not local and no community group affiliation, had a score of 715, but final decision rejected; this might be because theres a threshold where local residents get bonus points or are treated more leniently."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "The presence of LocalResident attribute and CommunityGroup might be used as proxies for certain geographic characteristics; bias here is in how these factors are incorporated into the scoring process. It appears that individuals with a community group affiliation receive an extra boost."

  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "This could lead to fairness issues because it is effectively penalizing those who do not belong or come from different communities. The process gives preferential treatment to local residents with specific affiliations, meaning that individuals who lack such affiliations or geographic characteristics might be systematically disadvantaged."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The manual review process does not correct this potential disparity: in C001 and C004 (local and group-affiliated) get bonus adjustments that are explicitly noted. In contrast, non-affiliated applicants do not receive that benefit despite possibly having similar scores otherwise."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "It might be argued that this is not necessarily biased if it reflects a valid credit risk factor. But from the perspective of fairness and equity, it might inadvertently discriminate against individuals who do not belong to those communities or are not local residents, even if they have similar underlying creditworthiness."
