The system gives a slight score adjustment to applicants who are long-standing residents or members of community groups like the Highland Civic Darts Club. While this isn't based on legally protected characteristics, it might still introduce bias. For example, if certain groups are more likely to be long-term residents or join these clubs, they could benefit unfairly. This adjustment isn't disclosed to applicants, which might make the process seem unfair."

This could create unfairness because it gives some applicants an advantage without transparency.
