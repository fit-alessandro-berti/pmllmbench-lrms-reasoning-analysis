Issue Purchase Order (PO) - sent to vendor after approval 4. Receive Goods (Goods receipt - happens after PO is issued and vendor delivers) 5. Vendor Invoice Received (Invoice arrives, typically after goods received or around same time) 6. Match Invoice to PO (Three-way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) 7. Release Payment (Payment after matching/verification) 8. Close Case"

Timeline makes sense."

    "Text": "**Case 1002:** - Create PR (08:30) - Issue PO (08:40) - Wait, thats 10 minutes later, but no approval yet! - Vendor Invoice Received (Feb 3, 07:00) - Release Payment (Feb 3, 07:15) - Payment before approval of PR? And before receiving goods? - Approve Purchase Requisition (Feb 3, 08:00) - Approval after PO issued AND after payment released! - Receive Goods (Feb 4) - After payment? - Match Invoice to PO (Feb 5) - After payment? Anomalies in Case 1002: 1. PO issued before PR approval (08:40 vs 08:00 approval is at 08:00... wait, let me check timestamps again) - Create: 08:30 - Issue PO: 08:40 (10 minutes later) - Approve PR: 08:00 on Feb 3? Wait, thats Feb 3, not Feb 1. Let me re-read carefully: ... Yes! The approval happens on Feb 3, but the PO was issued on Feb 1. This is a major anomaly - issuing a PO before the requisition is approved. Also, payment is released on Feb 3 at 07:15, but the approval happens at 08:00 on the same day (45 minutes later), and goods are received on Feb 4 (after payment!). Also matching happens after payment, which is wrong."

It could be fraud or error."

This suggests Maverick buying or Off-contract purchasing where goods are received without a formal PO in place. This breaks the three-way match concept and proper procurement controls."

Payment released before goods receipt (Feb 3 vs Feb 4) 4. Payment released before invoice matching (Matching is Feb 5) 5. Invoice matching after payment (should be before) **Case 1003:** 1. Payment released before goods receipt (Feb 8 vs Feb 10) 2. Payment released before invoice receipt (Feb 8 vs Feb 9) 3. Payment released before invoice matching (Feb 8 vs Feb 11) This is Pay on Account or advance payment without verification. **Case 1004:** 1. Goods received before PO issued (Feb 6 09:00 vs Feb 6 09:15 - though close in time, still out of sequence) This indicates receiving goods without a valid PO, which is a control weakness."

Case 1002: - Feb 1: Create (08:30), Issue PO (08:40) - Feb 3: Invoice (07:00), Payment (07:15), Approve PR (08:00) Yes, definitely PO before approval and payment before approval. Case 1003: - Feb 2: Create, Approve, Issue PO - Feb 8: Payment - Feb 9: Invoice - Feb 10: Goods Yes, payment way before goods/invoice. Case 1004: - Feb 5: Create, Approve - Feb 6: Receive Goods (09:00), Issue PO (09:15) Yes, goods 15 minutes before PO. Could be data entry error, but still an anomaly."

    "Text": "Now I should structure the answer clearly, explaining why each is problematic from a business/internal control perspective. Key concepts to mention: - Segregation of duties - Three-way match (PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice) - Approval authority (PO shouldnt be issued without approval) - Payment controls (shouldnt pay before verifying receipt of goods/services) - Financial risk (paying for goods not received, duplicate payments, fraud) - Compliance with procurement policies ... So the main anomalies are: 1. Case 1002: Out-of-sequence approval (after PO and payment), payment before goods receipt and matching 2. Case 1003: Payment before any verification (goods or invoice) 3. Case 1004: Goods receipt before PO (maverick buying) I should present this clearly with explanations of why these violate standard P2P controls."
