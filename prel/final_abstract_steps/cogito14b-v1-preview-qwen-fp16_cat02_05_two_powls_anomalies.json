Then theres branching: either they decide immediately or conduct interviews (Interviews) first before making the decision (Make_Hiring_Decision). After deciding to hire, they onboard the employee (Onboard_Employee), add them to payroll (Add_to_Payroll), and close the case."

    "Text": "Now Model 2 introduces loops and exclusive choices. The key differences here are that Interviews is done right after Posting the ad, before Screening. Then the loop_onboarding allows Onboard to repeat with a skip transition, which might mean the onboarding isnt completed properly. Theres also an xor_payroll operator where either Payroll or a silent transition (skip) happens before closing."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In Model 2, having Interviews before Screening is a big anomaly because typically youd screen candidates first and then interview those who pass. Also, allowing onboarding to loop with a skip could mean employees arent fully onboarded. Similarly, skipping payroll adds risk of missing important steps."

Model 1 seems closer since it follows a logical flow: posting job ad  screening (with optional interviews)  decision  onboarding  payroll  close. Model 2s anomalies disrupt key sequential and mandatory steps, making it less correct."
