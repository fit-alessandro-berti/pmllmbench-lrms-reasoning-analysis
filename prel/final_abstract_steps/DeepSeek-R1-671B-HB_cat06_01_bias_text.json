    "Text": "Then step 4: Underwriters look at cases that barely meet or miss the threshold. They're told to consider context, like employer stability and residence longevity. But since they already have the community integration adjustment from step 3, they might subconsciously favor those applicants more."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The problem here is that even if the community integration isn't formally proven to correlate with financial responsibility, the underwriters might still give preferential treatment based on that. This introduces human bias, which is harder to control and measure."

    "Text": "So combining steps 3 and 4, even if the initial adjustment in step 3 is rule-based, the manual review in step 4 might compound the bias. The final decision in step 5 uses the adjusted scores and underwriter recommendations, leading to possible lower interest rates for certain applicants not based on financial factors alone."

    "Text": "Also, the fact that the adjustment isn't disclosed is problematic because applicants don't know they're being judged on this factor, so they can't address it. This lack of transparency can erode trust and raise ethical concerns."

    "Text": "Legally, since it's not a protected class, they might not be violating laws, but ethically, it's questionable. The impact on fairness is that applicants with similar financial backgrounds but different community ties get different treatment, which isn't based on their actual creditworthiness."
