    "Text": "First, I need to analyze the current process. The original BPMN has a structured flow starting with receiving a customer request. The key steps are checking request type (standard vs custom), performing checks, calculating delivery dates, seeking approval, and sending confirmations. The main bottlenecks likely include the approval step for custom requests and manual tasks like feasibility checks."

    "Text": "The user emphasized reducing turnaround time and increasing flexibility. Automation seems crucial here. Task B2s custom analysis is manual and time-consuming. Integrating automation here could speed things up. Also, the concurrent checks (C1 and C2) might be parallelizable, but if some checks are faster, automating them with bots could help."

    "Text": "For resource reallocation, dynamic assignment of tasks based on workload seems essential. After the credit/inventory check, if results are positive, the process proceeds. But if not, maybe the process should loop back automatically. Current looping in E2 to E1 and H to D is manual or conditional. Automating these loops could save time."
