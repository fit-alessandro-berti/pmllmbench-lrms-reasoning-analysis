Wait, Risk Assessment is before Loan Decision, but Credit Check is after Risk Assessment, which violates Credit Check before Risk Assessment. Sequence: Received Risk Assessment Credit Check Loan Decision ... Wait, Risk Assessment before Credit Check is a violation. Additionally, Loan Decision is after Risk Assessment, which is ok, but the prior step is wrong. Then, Finalize Documentation after rejection, which is explicitly not allowed. Close Case is after, but since finalization happened incorrectly, its part of the issue. So, multiple violations: wrong order (Risk Assessment before Credit Check), and finalizing documentation after rejection."

Approved, so finalization before close is correct. No skips or wrong order in terms of sequence. Timestamps show Credit Check on 2024-01-14, which is after Received on 2024-01-12, but thats a timing issue, not a sequence violation. Sequence seems intact. Loan Decision on 2024-01-14 12:00, Inform Applicant on 2024-01-16 15:00, which is after, so order is correct. No normative violations here, I think. The issues are with timing and missing activities, which might be desiderata. In the log, it says No Follow-up Call, but follow-up call is not part of normative, its desiderata. Also, in the sequence, all required activities are present and in order. So, for normative rules, Case 3 should be compliant."

But its encouraged, not required. So, might be a failure to meet desideratum. The log doesnt specify if follow-up call was done or not for Case 1 and 2. For Case 3, it explicitly says No Follow-up Call. For others, its not mentioned, so I should assume its not done only if specified, or perhaps its absent. Looking back at the event log, for Case 3, it says (No Follow-up Call), but for Case 1 and 2, no such note. Probably, we should assume that if its not listed, it wasnt done, or perhaps only Case 3 has it mentioned because its relevant. To be precise, the desideratum is to perform a follow-up call, and its not in the log for any case, but only Case 3 has a note saying no follow-up call. For consistency, perhaps we assume that if not listed, it wasnt done. But in the log, for Case 3, its explicitly stated, so maybe for others, it was done or not specified. To avoid assumption, Ill go by whats provided. In the event log table, only activities are listed, and for Case 3, theres an additional note. Probably, follow-up call is not recorded in the table, so for all cases, it might not be done, but only Case 3 has it highlighted. Perhaps I should consider that follow-up call is not present in any log, so all cases might fail that desideratum, but only Case 3 has it mentioned because other desiderata are violated there."

Wait, in Case 2 log: after Loan Decision, it has Finalize Documentation and Close Case, but no Inform Applicant listed.

Is that required? Normative rules say: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. In Case 2, its missing! I missed that. Normative constraint: Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. And its part of the sequence. In the sequence: ... Loan Decision Inform Applicant ... And in not allowed: skipping activities. So, in Case 2, Inform Applicant is not present. That should be a normative violation, not just desideratum. Confirm. Key normative constraints: Sequence includes Inform Applicant after Loan Decision. And Skipping activities in the required sequence is not allowed. So, in Case 2, Inform Applicant is not present. That should be a skip, so normative violation. Also, in Case 3, all activities are present. In Case 2, no Inform Applicant, so definitely a violation. In the log, its not there, so yes. For desiderata, Inform Applicant timing is separate.

Also, timing recommendations. Case 1: - Credit Check: within 24 hours? Yes. - Inform Applicant: within 48 hours? Yes. - Follow-up Call: not mentioned, so probably not done. Since its encouraged, this is a failure to meet desideratum. But to be precise, if not listed, assume not done. Similarly for other cases. Case 2: - Credit Check: Received 08:00, Credit Check 09:00 same day, within 24 hours, ok. - Inform Applicant: not even done, so certainly not within 48 hours. But this is already a normative violation, not just desideratum. Desiderata are about when its done, but if not done, its worse, but primarily its a normative issue. Perhaps for desiderata, we consider only when the activity is performed. But the desideratum is inform promptly within 48 hours, implying it is done, but timing. Since its not done in Case 2, it automatically fails any timing desideratum. Follow-up call not done. Case 3: - Credit Check: more than 24 hours (as calculated, about 49 hours), so fails desideratum. - Inform Applicant: Loan Decision on 2024-01-14 12:00, Inform on 2024-01-16 15:00. Calculate time: From Jan 14 12:00 to Jan 16 12:00 is 48 hours, to 15:00 is 51 hours, so more than 48 hours, fails desideratum. - Follow-up Call: explicitly not done, so fails."

For Case 3 desiderata failures: - Credit Check delayed: perhaps high workload, or application needed additional information that delayed the check. - Inform Applicant late: maybe applicant was hard to reach, or internal delays. - No Follow-up Call: could be due to time constraints or deemed unnecessary for this case."

    "Text": "Now, structure the answer. Answer Structure: 1. Normative Violations: - Case 1: No violations. The process followed the strict sequence correctly. - Case 2: Violations include: - Risk Assessment performed before Credit Check, violating the order. - Inform Applicant activity is missing, which is a required step. - Finalize Documentation performed after a rejection, which is not allowed. - Case 3: No normative violations. All steps are in the correct order and present. 2. Desiderata Failures: - Case 1: Possibly fails to meet the desideratum of performing a Follow-up Call, as it is not recorded. Credit Check and Inform Applicant timings are within recommendations. - Case 2: Fails desiderata for Inform Applicant (not done, so not within 48 hours), and likely no Follow-up Call. Credit Check was within 24 hours. - Case 3: Fails multiple desiderata: - Credit Check not within 24 hours (took about 49 hours). - Inform Applicant not within 48 hours of Loan Decision (took about 51 hours). - No Follow-up Call performed. Clarify that these are not severe. 3. Suggestions for interpretations: - For Case 2s violations, it might be due to process errors, such as incorrect routing of the application or system bugs. - For Case 3s desiderata failures, justifications could include external factors like weekends or holidays delaying actions, or resource constraints in the department."
