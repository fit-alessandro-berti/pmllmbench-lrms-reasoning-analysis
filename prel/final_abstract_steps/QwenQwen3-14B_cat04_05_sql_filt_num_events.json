    "Text": "Wait, that seems right. The subquery gets all case_ids with 6 or fewer events, and the outer query selects all events belonging to those case_ids. But let me test this logic. Suppose a case_id has 7 events. The subquery would exclude it, so the outer query doesnt select any of its events. For case_ids with 6 or less, all their events are included. Yes, that seems correct."
