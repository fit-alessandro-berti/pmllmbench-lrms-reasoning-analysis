    "Text": "First, I need to identify which cases are violating the normative rules. The normative rules have two main parts: strict sequence and ordering rules. The ordering rules have several constraints, including the sequence of activities, the order of performing these activities, and some specific timing recommendations."

    "Text": "Starting with Case 1: The application is received, credit check, risk assessment, loan decision (approved), inform, finalize documentation, close case. This seems to follow all the normative constraints. The activities are in the correct order, no contradictions, and all timings are reasonable. So, no issues here."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next, Case 2: This case starts with an application received. Then, there's a risk assessment, but wait, according to the normative constraints, the Credit Check must occur before Risk Assessment. In this case, the Credit Check happens after the Risk Assessment. So, this violates the ordering rule. Additionally, the loan decision is approved, but since the previous activity was Risk Assessment, this should have been the first step after Credit Check. So, this case violates both the sequence and the order constraint."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Moving to Case 3: The application is received, then a Credit Check, followed by a Loan Decision (approved). Wait, but according to the normative sequence, after Credit Check comes Risk Assessment. So here, after Credit Check, it directly goes to Loan Decision, skipping Risk Assessment. That's a clear violation."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Furthermore, the Loan Decision is approved, so the following step should be Inform Applicant, but in this case, the Inform Applicant is done after the Loan Decision. That's another issue. Also, after a loan decision, whether approved or rejected, the case should follow the decision logic, which here isn't the case because after approved, it's Finalize Documentation before closing, but here it's just Inform and Close. So, that's a violation too."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - IND",
    "Text": "Now, looking at the desiderata section, it mentions that while some actions are not serious violations, they are considered desirable. For example, following up with the applicant and setting a follow-up call. So, any violation here isn't a problem, but ideally, these should be followed."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "In the event log, for Case 2, the risk assessment is done after the credit check, which is a violation. Also, the loan decision is approved but the process moves directly to inform and close without following the decision logic, which is another violation. These are clearly incorrect and should not happen."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Cases 2 and 3 also have timing issues: Case 2's Risk Assessment is done more than 24 hours after the application, and Case 3's Credit Check is done more than 24 hours later than expected, and the Loan Decision in Case 3 is approved after Finalize Documentation, which is not allowed."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "So, summarizing: Case 2 violates the sequence and order constraints because it does Risk Assessment after Credit Check. It also violates the decision logic by approving without finalizing. Cases 3 and 3a (assuming there was another case) violate the sequence and order because after Credit Check, they proceed to Loan Decision without Risk Assessment, and then do Inform and Close without following the decision."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - IND",
    "Text": "Case 2 also has a timing issue because it performed Risk Assessment more than 24 hours after application, which violates desiderata rules but not normative ones."
