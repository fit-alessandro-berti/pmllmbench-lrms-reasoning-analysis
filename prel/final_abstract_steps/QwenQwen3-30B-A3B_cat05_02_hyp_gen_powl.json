  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "But also the model allows C to be done after A directly so maybe a claim is closed before the loop E and P So check if the C event occurs before the E or P events For example the earliest timestamp of C is before the earliest E or P Alternatively for each claim check if the earliest C event is before the earliest E or P event Another point the model allows C to be done after A directly So maybe a claim is closed C after A but before E or P So even if EP exist but the C is before them So the query above would catch that"
