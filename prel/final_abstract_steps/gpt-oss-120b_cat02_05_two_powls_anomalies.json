    "Text": "Let's analyze Model 1. It is a StrictPartialOrder. The edges are Post to Screen, Screen to Decide, Screen to Interview, Decide to Onboard, Onboard to Payroll, and Payroll to Close. There is no edge between Decide and Interview. This is a potential anomaly. Decide can happen in parallel with Interview, or even before it. This is a major logical flaw. You can not make a hiring decision before or during the interview phase; it must come after. The result of the interview should inform the decision."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Anomalies in Model 1: Anomaly 1.1 Severe: Decide and Interview are parallel activities following Screen. This allows Make Hiring Decision to occur before Conduct Interviews is finished, which is logically incorrect. Anomaly 1.2 Severe: Conduct Interviews is a dangling activity. It is triggered by Screen, but its outcome does not connect to Make Hiring Decision."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let's analyze Model 2. It is also a StrictPartialOrder. It uses operators: loop onboarding and xor payroll. loop onboarding means Onboard is executed once, and then there is a choice to either exit the loop or repeat the onboarding process. xor payroll means you either Add to Payroll or you skip it entirely. Skipping adding an employee to payroll after onboarding them is a major process flaw. If you onboard someone, they must be paid."

    "Text": "Anomalies in Model 2: Anomaly 2.1 Severe: Screen Candidates and Conduct Interviews are parallel activities that can start after Post Job Ad. This means interviews can happen without screening. Anomaly 2.2 Severe: The xor payroll operator allows for a scenario where an employee is onboarded but never added to the payroll system. Anomaly 2.3 Minor/Moderate: The loop onboarding operator allows for the Onboard Employee activity to be repeated."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Model 2 seems to have more severe flaws. The possibility of not paying an onboarded employee is a critical, process breaking failure. Model 2 has three very severe critical flaws, while Model 1 has two. The optional payroll in Model 2 is arguably the single worst flaw, as it breaks the retire part of the process for a hired employee. A company that onboards but does not pay employees is fundamentally broken."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The post decision flow of Model 1 (Decide to Onboard to Payroll to Close) is perfectly standard, making the overall model more salvageable and closer to the norm than Model 2. The post decision logic in Model 2 introduces a new, critical flaw that Model 1 does not have. Therefore, Model 1 is more normative than Model 2."
