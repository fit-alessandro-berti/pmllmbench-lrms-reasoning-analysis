    "Text": "After preliminary scoring (C), the process branches: One branch: Check local affiliation (D) -> which leads to a subtle score uplift. The other branch: Skip (silent transition) -> meaning no uplift. Therefore, only applicants who go through D receive the uplift."

    "Text": "If the condition for taking the D branch is correlated with membership in a particular group (even if that group is not legally protected), then that group may be more likely to receive the uplift. For example, suppose the preliminary scoring (C) uses certain features that are more common in a non-legally protected group (e.g., living in a particular neighborhood, having a certain type of job, etc.). Then, that group might be more often routed to D and hence receive the uplift, leading to a higher chance of approval or better terms."

    "Text": "The uplift from D directly affects the final decision (F). Therefore, applicants who are routed to D have an advantage over those who are not, even if they are otherwise similar."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "If the routing condition is correlated with group membership, then the advantage is systematically given to one group over others. This can lead to: Disparate outcomes: The group that more often gets the uplift will have better loan terms or higher approval rates. Unfairness: Even if the group is not legally protected, it may be arbitrary or irrelevant to creditworthiness. For example, if the uplift is given based on local affiliation and that affiliation is more common in a wealthy neighborhood, then applicants from that neighborhood get an advantage, potentially exacerbating existing socioeconomic disparities."

    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Fairness Definitions: Individual Fairness: Two similar individuals should receive similar outcomes. If two applicants with similar credit profiles are treated differently because one is routed to D and the other is not (due to a condition that might be arbitrary or correlated with non-credit factors), then individual fairness is violated. Group Fairness: If the proportion of positive outcomes (approvals, favorable terms) differs between groups (even non-protected ones) because one group is more often routed to D, then group fairness metrics (like demographic parity) might be violated."

    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The bias might lead to a feedback loop: the favored group gets more loans and better terms, which improves their economic standing, making them even more likely to be favored in the future. Conversely, the disfavored group may be systematically disadvantaged."

  {
    "Name": "Ethical or Moral Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Even if the group is not legally protected, ethical concerns arise. Lending practices should be based on factors directly related to credit risk. If the uplift is given for reasons not directly related to creditworthiness (like local affiliation), then it may be considered unfair or discriminatory in a broader sense. Regulatory bodies might still scrutinize such practices if they lead to disparate impacts on protected groups indirectly. For example, if the non-protected group that is favored (say, urban residents) is composed predominantly of one race, then it could have a disparate impact on race, which is protected."
