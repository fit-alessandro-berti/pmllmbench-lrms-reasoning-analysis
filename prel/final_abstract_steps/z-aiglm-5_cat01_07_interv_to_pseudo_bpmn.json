Get confirmation -> Match invoice vs PO. Match? Yes -> Send to Manager. No -> Email Purchasing to clarify. If unresolved -> Escalate to Supervisor. Issue resolved & Manager approves -> Schedule payment. 2. Dan (Purchasing Officer): Receives invoice from AP -> Compare details (qty, price) with PO. Issues? -> Contact supplier or ask AP to hold for corrected version. Correct? -> Send confirmation email to AP. Missing PO? -> Tell Mary to get info. (Note: He assumes Mary moves it to manager after his confirmation). 3. Carlos (Dept Manager): Receives notification after match & Dans confirmation -> Reviews details. Good? -> Approve. Suspicious/Issues? -> Reject or ask AP to hold/investigate. Approve -> Goes to AP for payment. 4. Rita (AP Supervisor): Handles escalations/exceptions. Mary cant match/unresolved discrepancy -> Escalate to Rita. Rita contacts supplier/coordinating. No PO (informal services) -> Create retrospective PO or reject. Exception cleared -> Back to normal flow (Purchasing confirmation -> Manager approval -> Scheduling). 5. Karen (Supplier Relationship Mgr): Involved if mismatch/no PO. Helps contact supplier for info/revised invoice. Checks contracts for pricing disputes. Doesnt approve directly."

No: Return to Supplier for details (AP Clerk/Supplier). Note: Karen might be involved here if issues persist, but Mary initiates. -> Loop back to start? Or just wait. Lets say Request Supplier Action. Yes: Log Invoice in System (AP Clerk). Task 2: Forward to Purchasing / Request Receipt Confirmation (AP Clerk). Task 3: Verify Goods/Services Receipt & Match Details (Purchasing Officer). Note: Dan mentions checking PO details. Mary mentions getting confirmation. Lets group this as Purchasing Verification. Gateway 2 (XOR): Is there a Discrepancy? Yes (Discrepancy found): Sub-process/Task: Resolve Discrepancy. Actions: Contact Supplier (Karen/Purchasing), Check Contracts (Karen), Clarify with AP (Dan/Mary), Hold Invoice. Escalation: If unresolved, Escalate to Supervisor (Rita). Supervisor Action: Retrospective PO or Reject or Coordinate. Outcome: Discrepancy Resolved -> Loop back to Verification or proceed to next step? Mary says Once all issues are resolved... send to manager. Dan says Send confirmation. Lets assume a loop until resolved, then proceed. No (Match confirmed): Send Confirmation (Purchasing Officer). Task 4: Match Invoice to PO (AP Clerk). Mary mentions matching after getting confirmation. Dan compares too. Lets align: Dan confirms receipt/details, Mary performs system match. Gateway 3 (XOR - Implicit or Explicit): Match Successful? Yes: Send for Approval (AP Clerk). No: (Covered in Discrepancy path above). Task 5: Review & Approve Invoice (Department Manager). Gateway 4 (XOR): Approval Decision? Approve: Process moves to payment. Reject/Hold: Return to AP for investigation (AP Clerk). Task 6: Schedule Payment (AP Clerk). End Event: Payment Scheduled."
