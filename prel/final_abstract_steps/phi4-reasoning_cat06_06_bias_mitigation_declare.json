For example, if CheckApplicantRace is performed, then before making decision, there should be BiasMitigationCheck. So I add: - In the response dictionary, add entry: CheckApplicantRace: {BiasMitigationCheck: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0}} But note that response is defined as mapping one activity to a dictionary of other activities with which it responds? Actually in DECLARE, the response constraint means: if A occurs then B must occur (but not necessarily immediately after?). But we want to ensure that decision steps cannot immediately follow CheckApplicantRace without first having BiasMitigationCheck. This might be implemented as a succession constraint: If CheckApplicantRace occurred, then before any decision event happens, there should be BiasMitigationCheck."
