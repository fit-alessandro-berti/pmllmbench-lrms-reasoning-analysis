Actually in DECLARE, the response constraint means: if A occurs then B must occur (but not necessarily immediately after?). But we want to ensure that decision steps cannot immediately follow CheckApplicantRace without intervening BiasMitigationCheck. This might be implemented as a succession constraint: If CheckApplicantRace occurred, then before any decision event happens, there should be BiasMitigationCheck. I could add: In the succession dictionary: add an entry mapping CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck, with support=1.0 and confidence=1.0. But then also want to ensure that if a decision step follows CheckApplicantRace without intervening BiasMitigationCheck, then it violates constraint. Actually the prompt says: Ensure that certain decision steps (Approve, Reject) cannot immediately follow an activity disclosing sensitive attributes (e.g., CheckApplicantRace) without first performing a BiasMitigationCheck.
