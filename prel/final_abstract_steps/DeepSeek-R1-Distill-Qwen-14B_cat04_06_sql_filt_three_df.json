  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "First, the problem is about analyzing an event log stored in a DuckDB table called event_log. The table has columns like case_id, activity, and timestamp. The goal is to identify certain cases that follow a specific sequence of activities and then exclude those cases from the final result."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The first requirement is to find any case_id that has the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', and then 'Confirm Order'. Importantly, there should be no other events from the same case between these three events. This means that after the first activity, the next activity must be the second, and then the third, without any intervening events."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Next, among the cases that have this specific sequence, I need to further refine the selection by looking at the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Specifically, I have to check if this duration is more than 5 days. If it is, these cases should be excluded from the final result."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The final result should include all events from event_log except those that belong to cases meeting both the sequence and timing criteria. So, the query needs to filter out these specific cases and return all other events."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Now, thinking about how to approach this in DuckDB. I know that DuckDB is a lightweight SQL database, so I'll need to use SQL functions and possibly window functions to handle the sequence and timing conditions."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "For the sequence part, I'll need to ensure that the three activities appear in the correct order without any other activities in between. One way to handle this is by using a window function to look ahead and check the next activities. Alternatively, I can assign a sequence number to each activity in a case and then check the order."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But a more efficient way might be to use the lead() function to look at the next activity and the one after that. This way, I can check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. This approach ensures that the three activities are consecutive."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Once I identify the cases that meet this sequence, I need to calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. I can do this by finding the timestamps of these two activities for each case and subtracting them to get the duration. If this duration is more than 5 days, I exclude those cases."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "To exclude these cases from the final result, I'll need to collect all the case_id values that meet both conditions and then use a WHERE clause to exclude them from the main query."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Putting it all together, I'll write a subquery to identify the bad cases (those that have the sequence and the timing issue). Then, in the main query, I'll select all events where the case_id is not in the list of bad cases."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I also need to make sure that the timestamps are correctly compared. Since timestamp is a datetime type, subtracting them will give me the interval between the two times. I'll convert this interval to days using the extract() function to check if it's greater than 5 days."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Additionally, I should group the results by case_id and activity to ensure that each case is processed correctly. Ordering by case_id and timestamp will help in correctly identifying the sequence."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Testing this approach, I can imagine that for each row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', I check the next two activities. If they match the required sequence, I then check the time difference. If the difference is more than 5 days, I add the case_id to the list of bad cases."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "In the main query, I simply exclude these case_id values and return all other events. This should give me the desired result set."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think this approach covers all the requirements. Now, I'll structure the SQL query accordingly, making sure to handle the sequence and timing conditions properly."
