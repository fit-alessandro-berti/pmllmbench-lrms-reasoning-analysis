The goal is to identify certain cases that follow a specific sequence of activities and then exclude those cases from the final result."

    "Text": "The first requirement is to find any `case_id` that has the exact sequence of three activities in direct succession: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed by 'Create Order', and then 'Confirm Order'. Importantly, there should be no other events from the same case between these three events."

    "Text": "Next, among the cases that have this specific sequence, I need to further refine the selection by looking at the time elapsed between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. Specifically, I have to check if this duration is more than 5 days. If it is, these cases should be excluded from the final result."

    "Text": "For the sequence part, I'll need to ensure that the three activities appear in the correct order without any other activities in between. One way to handle this is by using a window function to look ahead and check the next activities. Alternatively, I can assign a sequence number to each activity in a case and then check the order."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "But a more efficient way might be to use the `lead()` function to look at the next activity and the one after that. This way, I can check if the current activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', the next is 'Create Order', and the one after that is 'Confirm Order'. This approach ensures that the three activities are consecutive."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Once I identify the cases that meet this sequence, I need to calculate the time difference between the 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' events. I can do this by finding the timestamps of these two activities for each case and subtracting them to get the duration. If this duration is more than 5 days, I exclude those cases."

    "Text": "Testing this approach, I can imagine that for each row where the activity is 'Approve Purchase Requisition', I check the next two activities. If they match the required sequence, I then check the time difference. If the difference is more than 5 days, I add the `case_id` to the list of bad cases."
