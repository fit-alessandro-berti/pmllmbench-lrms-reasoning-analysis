Then it goes to R&D to design the prototype. After that, there's a parallel gateway where four different tasks branch out to secure components from different countries. So, they're getting microprocessors from Taiwan, camera modules from Japan, OLED screens from South Korea, and sensors and memory from Germany and the USA."

After assembly, there's an exclusive gateway where it either goes to Quality Checks or Rework/Scrap. If it passes quality, it moves on to packing and labeling. Then another parallel gateway splits into air freight for high-demand markets and cargo shipping for others. After that, each path goes through customs and then to regional distribution centers."
