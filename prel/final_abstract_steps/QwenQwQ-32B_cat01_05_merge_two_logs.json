Log B has richer attributes: user_id, resource_id, notes, and the event names are slightly different. For example, \"Payment Processed\" vs \"PaymentCheck\". The timestamps here can be a few seconds or milliseconds off from Log A. Also, some events in one log might not appear in the other."

Wait, the timeout is under 2 seconds. So these two events are 5 seconds apart? That's a problem. Wait no wait the times: A: 10:02:00 B: 10:02:05 is 5 seconds later. That's over the 2-second tolerance. So they cant be merged? But they have similar event types. Alternatively, perhaps did I miscalculate? Lets see: The problem says to use a small timestamp tolerance (less than 2 seconds). So 5 seconds difference is too much. So, this event in Log A and B's PaymentCheck are 5 seconds apart, so they have to be separate."

The timing difference is exactly 2 seconds. Wait, the problem says less than 2 seconds? The example uses less than 2. If the tolerance is exactly 2, then up to and including 2 seconds? The wording says \"less than 2 seconds\". So 2 seconds would be the limit. If the user says \"less than\", then 2 is not included. So 10:05:00 (A) +2 sec is 10:05:02 (B), difference is exactly 2, which is over the limit. So they can't be merged?"
