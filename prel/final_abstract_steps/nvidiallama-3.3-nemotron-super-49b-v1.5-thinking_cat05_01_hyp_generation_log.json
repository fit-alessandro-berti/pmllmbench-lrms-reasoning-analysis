Wait, looking at the data, case_id 1004 does have Receive Payment as event_id 22, but it's right after Register Order. That's way too early. Normally, payment should come after the invoice is issued and goods are shipped. So in case 1004, the payment is received before the invoice is even issued (event_id 23 is Issue Invoice after Receive Payment). That's a problem because you can't receive payment before invoicing. That's a clear anomaly."

Case_id 1002 is missing Validate Stock? Wait, looking at the data for 1002: events are Register Order, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Perform Credit Check, Validate Stock, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment.

Case_id 1003 also 1 day. Case_id 1004's payment was received the same day as the order, which is very quick. But the invoice was issued after the payment, which is odd.

Missing steps: Maybe some steps are not logged properly, or certain steps are skipped intentionally (but that would be a policy violation). 3. Early payments: Could be prepayments, but if the process requires invoicing first, then this is a deviation. Alternatively, data entry errors where the payment event was logged incorrectly. 4.

Additionally, check the time between 'Issue Invoice' and 'Receive Payment' to see if payments are delayed or unusually quick. Also, check if high-value orders have more anomalies, by joining with the orders table. Another point: looking at the resources involved. For example, in case_id 1004, the Confirm Shipment was done by LogisticsMgr_1, but the shipment_scheduled is 'N', which might indicate a problem.
