If its standard they do standard validation then an AND gateway to run parallel checks credit and inventory. After that they calculate the delivery date."

The custom path has a decision after feasibility. Then both paths converge at the approval check. Approvals depend on some condition maybe based on the request type or the results from earlier steps."
