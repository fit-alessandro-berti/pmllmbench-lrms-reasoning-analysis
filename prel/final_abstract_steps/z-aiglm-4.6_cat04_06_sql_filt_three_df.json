Using lead ensures consecutive rows as per timestamp ordering, which ensures no other events between. However, if there are ties (multiple events with same timestamp), they could be considered consecutive but may not be considered direct succession. Usually process logs have timestamps unique per case. We can also add tie-breaker using row_number with ordering by timestamp, maybe also by event ID. Better to have row_number. But the above approach is fine."

Thus final answer: Provide query with explanation. We should ensure correct handling of timestamp differences > 5 days. Use interval or datediff. We also need to ensure that we use the correct function for interval. In DuckDB, interval syntax: INTERVAL '5' DAY or INTERVAL '5 days'. I think it's INTERVAL '5 days'. Or INTERVAL '5' DAY. Both may work. Now the final answer: Provide query and explanation. Also ensure that we mention ordering if needed: the final result can be ordered by case_id, timestamp. Thus final answer: Provide query. Now I will write final answer accordingly."
