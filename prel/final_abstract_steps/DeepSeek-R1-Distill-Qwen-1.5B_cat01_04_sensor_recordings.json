This seems like a cutting operation, possibly cutting metal. The temperature and vibration are high, which is typical for cutting tools."

    "Text": "From event 6 onwards, the temperature continues to rise, pressure drops slightly, vibration increases a bit, material flow increases, tool position moves to 10 mm, energy consumption increases a bit, and temperature starts to decline. This looks like an assembly operation, maybe assembling parts. The tool position moving to 10 might indicate placing the tool as it moves through the material."

This seems like a shutdown of the cutting operation, which might be a stage in the assembly process, maybe packaging or packaging parts."
