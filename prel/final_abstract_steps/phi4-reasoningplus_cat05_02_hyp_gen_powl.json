So its anomalous because we should not have multiple approvals... The XOR operator for customer notification: XOR between Notify Customer (N) vs skip... anomaly here is that process might not always notify customers... Partial ordering anomalies in the model: Root partial order... includes edge from R to A... A to loop... loop to xor. But then there is an additional edge added from A directly to C... means that claim closure (C) could be done even before proper evaluation/approval... might allow premature closure. Also its mentioned we will also introduce partial ordering anomalies... allow some out-of-sequence execution... So there is anomaly in ordering constraints..."
