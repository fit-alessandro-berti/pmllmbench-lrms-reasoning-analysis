    "Text": "First, let's recall the normative constraints. The strict sequence is: Application Received  Credit Check  Risk Assessment  Loan Decision  Inform Applicant. Then, if approved, Finalize Documentation before Close Case; if rejected, no Finalize Documentation before closing. Key things that are not allowed: skipping steps, reversing order (like Risk before Credit Check), finalizing documentation after rejection, or closing without following the decision logic."

This seems to follow the sequence perfectly. No skips, correct order. Approved so Finalize before Close. So Case 1 is compliant with normative rules."

    "Text": "Case 2: Application Received 08:00, Risk Assessment at 08:20 (before Credit Check! That's a problem), Then Credit Check at 09:00 (after Risk Assessment, which violates the order), Loan Decision (Rejected) at 09:30, Finalize Documentation at 10:00 (after rejection, which is not allowed), Close Case at 10:30. So here, multiple normative violations."

    "Text": "Case 3: For normative rules: Let's check sequence. Application  Credit Check (yes, after application), Risk after Credit Check, Decision after Risk, Inform after Decision. Then Approved, so Finalize before Close. So sequence-wise, it's okay. No skips or order issues. The Credit Check happened after 24h, but that's a desideratum, not a normative rule. Similarly, Inform Applicant took more than 48h, which is a desideratum violation. No follow-up call, which is also a desideratum. But normatively, the sequence is correct. So no normative violations here."

Let's see: Application Received  Credit Check (yes, even though delayed, but sequence is correct), Credit Check  Risk Assessment (yes), Risk  Decision (yes), Decision  Inform (yes), Approved, so Finalize before Close (yes). So normatively, it's okay. The delays are just desiderata issues."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",

    "Text": "Case 3: Credit Check: Application at 09:00 on 12th, Credit Check on 14th 10:00. That's 2 days later (48+ hours), so violates the 24h desideratum. Inform Applicant: Decision at 14th 12:00, Inform at 16th 15:00. So 2 days and 3 hours later. Which is over 48h. So violates the inform within 48h. No follow-up call. But since it's recommended but not required, it's a desideratum not met, but not a violation. However, the desiderata says it is encouraged but not strictly required to perform a Follow-up Call, so not doing it is a desideratum failure but not a serious issue."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in Case 2, the Credit Check happened after Risk Assessment, but the timing of Credit Check itself: 08:00 to 09:00 is within 24h. So yes, but the problem is the sequence, not the timing. So for desiderata, the timing is separate from the sequence. So Case 2's timing for Credit Check is okay, but the sequence violation is a normative issue. So yes, only Case 3 has desiderata issues."

    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, for the suggestions or justifications. For Case 2: The process steps were out of order. Maybe the Risk Assessment was done prematurely, perhaps due to a system error or human mistake. They shouldn't have done Risk before Credit Check. Also, after rejection, they shouldn't finalize documentation. This might be a case of not checking the decision before proceeding. Need to enforce the sequence strictly. For Case 3: The delays in Credit Check and Inform might be due to high workload or resource constraints."
