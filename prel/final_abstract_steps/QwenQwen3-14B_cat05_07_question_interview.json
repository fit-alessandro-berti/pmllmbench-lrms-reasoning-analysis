    "Text": "Okay I need to come up with a list of open-ended questions to ask the interviewee about their property onboarding process. Let me start by breaking down the process they described. First the process starts with a landlord contacting the regional office. Then a property coordinator checks documents. If there are missing documents they request updates. Once verified the property details are recorded into the database. Then a property manager is assigned based on factors like workload geography experience etc. Theres an intro call between the manager and landlord. Then a photographer and inspector are scheduled. If the inspection has issues they work with the landlord to fix them. Then marketing is done the property is activated tenant screening happens lease finalized and then quality checks and audits."
