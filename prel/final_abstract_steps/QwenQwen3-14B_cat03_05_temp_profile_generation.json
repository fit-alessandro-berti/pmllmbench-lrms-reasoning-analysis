For example, (SS, QI) would require that in some trace, SS is followed by QI, which would mean that OP and RC are skipped? Thats unlikely. So maybe that pair shouldnt be included. Because in reality, SS is followed by OP, then RC, then QI."

    "Text": "So if in some execution, SS is followed by QI (maybe in a different process variation), then its allowed. But in the standard process, thats not the case. However, the problem says to consider the pairs that appear in the event logs. So if the logs have such a pair, its included. But since the user hasnt provided specific logs, I need to assume that some variations exist where steps are skipped or reordered."
