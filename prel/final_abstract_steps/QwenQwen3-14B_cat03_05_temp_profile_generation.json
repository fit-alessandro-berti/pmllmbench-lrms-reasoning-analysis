(OP, RC): Direct next step, maybe 1-2 weeks for delivery. 4. (OP, QI): OP to QI would be after RC. So maybe after OP, RC takes time, then QI. So the average time between OP and QI would be the sum of OP to RC and RC to QI. But since these are averages, maybe OP to QI is around 2 weeks? 5. (RC, QI): Direct step, maybe a few days. 6. (RC, CA): RC to CA would involve QI and then CA. So maybe a few weeks. 7. (QI, CA): Direct step, maybe a few days. 8. (CA, PT): Direct step, maybe a few days. 9. (CA, PK): After CA, PT is done first, then PK. So CA to PK would be PT time plus PK time. Maybe a week or so. 10. (PT, PK): Direct step, a day or two. 11. (PK, WS): Direct step, maybe a day. 12. (WS, DT): Direct step, maybe a few days to a week for shipping. 13. (DT, AS): Direct step, maybe after delivery, a few days for support. 14. (SS, AS): This would be a long time, spanning all steps. Maybe months. 15. (OP, DT): OP to DT would involve RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT. So a long time, maybe a few weeks. 16. (RC, AS): Similarly, after RC, all steps until AS. Could be a couple of weeks. 17. (QI, AS): QI to AS would be after CA, PT, PK, WS, DT. Maybe a few weeks. 18. (CA, AS): After CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. Maybe 2-3 weeks. 19. (PT, AS): After PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. Maybe a couple of weeks. 20. (PK, AS): PK to AS would be WS, DT, AS. Maybe a few days to a week. 21. (WS, AS): After WS, DT and then AS. Maybe a few days. 22. (DT, AS): Direct step, maybe a few days. 23. (SS, DT): SS to DT would be all steps up to DT. Maybe a few weeks. 24. (SS, PK): SS to PK would be all steps up to PK. Maybe a few weeks."
