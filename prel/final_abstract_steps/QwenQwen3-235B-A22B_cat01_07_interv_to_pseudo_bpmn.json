    "Text": "First, Interview 1 with Mary from Accounts Payable. She describes the initial steps: receiving the invoice, checking for a valid PO. If no PO, send back to supplier. If theres a PO, log it into the system. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of goods/services received. Once confirmed, match invoice line items with PO. If they match, send to manager for approval. If discrepancies, clarify with purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor (Rita). After resolution and approval, schedule payment."

If PO missing, tell Mary to get it. Once confirmed, send confirmation email to AP. Then manager approval. After that, AP schedules payment."

Forward to Purchasing for confirmation (Mary Dan) 4. Confirm Goods Received (Dan) - compare details. Gateway: discrepancies? - Yes: Clarify with AP (Dan emails Mary) - If cant resolve: Escalate to Supervisor (Rita) - No: Proceed to Match Invoice to PO (Mary) 5. Match Invoice to PO (Mary) - gateway: match? - No: Clarify with Purchasing (loop back to Dan) - Dan might contact Supplier (Karen) if needed. - Yes: Send to Manager Approval (Mary Carlos) 6. Manager Approval (Carlos) - gateway: approve? - No: Reject, Hold for investigation (Mary) - Yes: Schedule Payment (Mary)"
