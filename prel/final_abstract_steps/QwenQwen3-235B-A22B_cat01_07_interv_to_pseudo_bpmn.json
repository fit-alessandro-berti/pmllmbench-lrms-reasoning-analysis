If there's a PO, log it into the system. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) for confirmation of goods/services received. Once confirmed, match invoice line items with PO. If they match, send to manager for approval. If discrepancies, clarify with purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor (Rita). After resolution and approval, schedule payment."

Gateway: discrepancies? - Yes: Clarify with AP (Dan emails Mary) - If can't resolve: Escalate to Supervisor (Rita) - No: Proceed to Match Invoice to PO (Mary) 5.

    "Text": "Now, putting this into a textual BPMN structure with tasks, flows, gateways, roles, and exceptions. Need to note where there might be variations. For example, Mary mentioned sometimes discrepancies lead to escalation, Dan mentioned holding invoices, Carlos can reject. Rita handles exceptions which might loop back into the process. Also, the system sends automatic emails for manager approval. So the trigger for Manager Approval is after matching and confirmation. I should structure the main steps in order, include exclusive gateways for decisions, and note the exception paths. Make sure to mention all roles and how they interact. Also, clarify when Karen is involved in resolving issues but not part of the system steps. Possible structure: Start Event: Invoice Received Process: - Receive Invoice (Mary) - Check PO Existence (Gateway) - No PO: Send Back to Supplier, loop back - Yes: Log Invoice - Forward to Purchasing (Dan) - Confirm Goods Receipt (Dan) - Gateway: Discrepancies? - Yes: Clarify with AP; if unresolved, Escalate to Rita - No: Proceed - Match Invoice to PO (Mary) - Gateway: Match Success? - No: Clarify with Purchasing (Dan may contact Karen) - Yes: Send for Approval - Manager Approval (Carlos) - Reject: Hold, Investigate (Mary) - Approve: Schedule Payment Exception handling paths for escalation to Rita, involving Karen in resolving discrepancies. Need to note that after Rita resolves, the invoice goes back to normal flow. Also, note that if Manager rejects, it's held for investigation, but how does it proceed from there? Maybe loop back to clarification steps. Also, Dan might ask for a revised invoice from supplier, which would require Mary to receive the revised invoice and continue the process. I think the textual model should list each task, who does it, the sequence flows, gateways with conditions, and exceptions. Let me try to outline this step by step."
