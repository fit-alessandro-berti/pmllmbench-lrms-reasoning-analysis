The xor_node is an XOR between successful_subtree and cancel_subtree. The successful_subtree has authorize_payment, package_items, and ship_order, and cancel_subtree has cancel_order and close_order."

But maybe there's a scenario where, after some steps, the process is canceled. However, in the standard order, after checking inventory, the correct steps are to authorize, then package, then ship, then close. Therefore, the trace where authorize, package, ship, and then cancel would be invalid."

This would be invalid because after checking inventory, the correct steps are to authorize, package, ship, close. But the model's xor_node allows both successful and cancel cases.
