    "Text": "The implications for fairness and equity would be that even if the process seems neutral on the surface the hidden branching based on factors that correlate with protected attributes even if not explicitly using them can lead to disparities This could lead to systemic inequality without obvious red flags in the data In terms of fairness metrics this could affect equal opportunity predictive parity or other fairness criteria"
