Actually case 2 has no Inform Applicant, but normative says Inform Applicant must occur after Loan Decision. So also missing that. So multiple violations."

That is a desideratum violation for all cases (none have follow-up). Also case 3 violates timing: credit check after >24h, inform after >48h. So note."
