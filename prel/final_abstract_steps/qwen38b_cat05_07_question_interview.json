Then they record details into the database. Then assigning a property manager based on workload, geography, experience, and track record. Then a meeting between manager and landlord. Then scheduling a photographer and inspector. If issues found, they address them. Then marketing materials created, property activated in the portal, tenant screening, lease agreement, security deposit, move-in date. Then quality checks and audits for compliance, financials, IT integration. Also, exceptions like special insurance or custom lease clauses. Communication via email, CRM, project tools."
