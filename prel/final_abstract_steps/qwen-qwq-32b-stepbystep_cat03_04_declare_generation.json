Let me clarify: For example, for 'responded existence', the key would be A and B, so like A's responded existence to B? ... Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding the structure. Let me recheck the user's prompt... Ah, right, for existence, each activity in that constraint has their own support and confidence. For the other keys (like responded existence, etc.), the value is a dictionary of activities and their support/confidence? ... Wait, perhaps the user's structure is that for each constraint type, the keys are the activities involved, but perhaps the structure is a bit different. Maybe the user's structure for 'responded existence' would have entries like 'responded existence' has a key of the source activity, and the value is a dictionary with the target activity and its metrics... Wait that makes sense. For example, if A must be responded by B, then in 'responded existence', the key is A, and the value is a dictionary like B: {support: 1.0, confidence: 1.0}?"

Wait, but that may not be the exact order. Let me think again: After Design Draft (DD), you need to check feasibility (TFC) and cost (CE). So maybe those two can be done in any order, but both must be done before PC. So TFC and CE must both precede PC... Similarly, after PC comes laboratory testing (LT) and user testing (UT). Maybe those can be in any order, but both must occur. Then AG (Approval) comes after those tests. So after LT and UT, then AG must come, so LT and UT must precede AG."
