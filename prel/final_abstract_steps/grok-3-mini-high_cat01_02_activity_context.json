From the log: - Activity Initiate Request appears once in each case, so no recurrence. - Verify Documents appears multiple times in C001 and C003, but only once in C002. In C001, it happens at 09:20:00 and 10:30:00. In C003, at 11:25:00 and 12:20:00. In C002, only once. - Call Customer appears multiple times in C001, C002, and C003. In C001: once at 09:45:00. In C002: twice, at 09:00:00 and 09:50:00. In C003: once at 11:50:00. - Adjust Account appears in C002 and C003, but only once each, so no recurrence within a case. - Approve Request appears once in each case, no recurrence. - Other activities like Submit Additional appear only in C001, once."

In C001, Verify Documents recurs, in C002, Call Customer recurs, in C003, both Verify Documents and Call Customer but Call Customer only once in C003? Let me check: C003 has Call Customer only once, at 11:50:00. In C002, it is twice: 09:00:00 and 09:50:00. In C001, Call Customer once, but Verify Documents twice. Specifically: - C001: Verify Documents twice, Call Customer once. - C002: Call Customer twice. - C003: Verify Documents twice, Call Customer once. So, Verify Documents recurs in C001 and C003, and Call Customer recurs in C002."

(after initial request) - Second occurrence: Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided. So, it is a re-verification after additional documents are submitted. - In C003, first occurrence: Physical verification of ID. (at branch) - Second occurrence: Re-verify docs after account adjustment. So again, a re-verification. Contextual difference: The first Verify Documents is initial verification, and the second is re-verification or follow-up verification."

So, first is to clarify an issue, second is to confirm actions. - In C003: Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return. So, it is to recall the customer.

For cases where an activity appears only once, keep the original name or give a context-specific name, but probably keep original if no recurrence. ... The task is to rename activities that appear multiple times within the same case, so for each case where an activity recurs, rename the instances within that case to reflect context. So, for C001, rename the two Verify Documents differently. For C002, rename the two Call Customer differently. For C003, rename the two Verify Documents differently.
