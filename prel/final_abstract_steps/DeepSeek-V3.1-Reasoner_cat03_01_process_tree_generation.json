So we have: -( +(AI, NC), -( -(FAS, DDI), +(BL, ICP, MRF) ) ) So the entire tree is: Root: Sequence child0: the entire part from A until the initial test (X(CE, FBP)) child1: the XOR (normal/abnormal) and then the advanced steps But note: the XOR (normal/abnormal) is the direct child of the sequence after the initial test, and then the advanced steps are the next. Well build the tree step by step. Due to the complexity, we might break the tree into subtrees. Lets define: S1 = -( A, -( RG, IA ) ) S2 = -( TI, TC ) InitialTest = X( CE, FBP ) LoopBody = -( SC, -( X(TM, SPT), X(FCE, FBA) ) ) Loop = * ( LoopBody, tau ) AfterTest = X( tau, Loop ) Advanced1 = +( AI, NC ) Advanced2 = -( FAS, DDI ) Advanced3 = +( BL, ICP, MRF )   [which we break into binary parallel operators] Then the entire tree is: -( -( -( S1, S2 ), InitialTest ), -( AfterTest, -( Advanced1, -( Advanced2, Advanced3 ) ) ) ) Now, we have to build Advanced3 as a parallel of three. We can do: Advanced3 = + ( BL, + ( ICP, MRF ) )   [or any other binary decomposition] Similarly, the entire tree is a sequence of two big parts. Lets code accordingly. Steps in code: Well create the root as a Sequence operator. Then we create the first part (from A to InitialTest) as a sequence of: seq1 = Sequence of [S1, S2] and then InitialTest Then we create the second part (from AfterTest to Advanced3) as a sequence of: AfterTest (which is an XOR) and then a sequence of Advanced1, Advanced2, and Advanced3. But note: the second part is -( AfterTest, -( Advanced1, -( Advanced2, Advanced3 ) ) ) Well build the tree from the leaves up. Due to the complexity, we might create the tree in multiple steps. Lets write the code accordingly. Note: We must set the parent of each node correctly and append the children in the correct order. Well use the following operators from the enum: Operator.SEQUENCE, Operator.XOR, Operator.PARALLEL, Operator.LOOP Lets code."
