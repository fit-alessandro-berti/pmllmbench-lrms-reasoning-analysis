The loop is between A and B, where you execute A, then either you exit the loop or execute B and then A again. So in this case, the loop is between BNC and D&R. Wait, the description says that after BNC, if there are issues, D&R is done. So the loop is: execute BNC, then either exit or do D&R and then BNC again. So the loop node would have children BNC and D&R? Or maybe the loop is structured as BNC followed by a choice between exiting the loop or D&R. Hmm, the loop operator in POWL is defined as a loop between two models. So the loop is between A and B, so you execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So in this case, the loop would be between BNC and D&R. So the loop node would have children BNC and D&R. But the problem says that after BNC, if there's an issue, then D&R is done. So the loop is: BNC is executed, then if there's an issue, D&R is executed, and then BNC again. So the loop is a loop between BNC and D&R. So the loop node would be an OperatorPOWL with operator=LOOP, children [BNC, D&R]. But the problem says that the loop is repeated until the configuration is stable. So the loop would be a loop that continues until the loop is exited. So the loop node would have BNC as the first step, and then D&R as the next step. So the loop is structured as: execute BNC, then either exit the loop or execute D&R and then BNC again. So the loop node is the operator, and the children are BNC and D&R.
