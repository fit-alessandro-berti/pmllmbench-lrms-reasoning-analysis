    "Text": "Potential Changes: 1. Task A: Receive Customer Request - Automate intake: Use AI to classify requests initially. - Propose: Add a predictive analytics step right after receipt to flag potential custom requests. 2. Gateway: Check Request Type - Enhance with machine learning for better accuracy and speed. 3. Standard Path: Task B1, Parallel Checks (C1, C2), Task D - Automate validations and checks. - Make parallel checks even faster or parallelize more. 4. Custom Path: Task B2, etc. - Use predictive analytics to pre-assess feasibility. - Allow dynamic resource allocation for feasibility analysis. 5. Approval Gateway - Automate approvals for straightforward cases. - Use analytics to predict approval outcomes. 6. Loop Back Mechanism - Make it more efficient, perhaps with automated re-evaluation. 7. Final Tasks: Task G, Task I - Automate invoice generation and confirmation sending."
