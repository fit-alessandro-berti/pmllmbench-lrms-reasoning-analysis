In POWL, a loop is modeled with Operator.LOOP between two sub-models. From the definition: * (A, B) means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. In this case, A could be the check, and B the action if not complete. ... Perhaps A is the data completeness check, and B is requesting more info. ... I'll assume that * (DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo) works, where DataCompletenessCheck might be a activity that could have internal logic, but in POWL it's just modeled as is."

To simplify, I can have ReceiveApplication, then the loop for ensuring data completeness. ... After the loop, if complete, proceed. Then SkillAssessment. Then the XOR for cultural fit. The XOR has two children: StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then after XOR, ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. Probably in sequence. So, the overall structure could be a StrictPartialOrder with nodes: [loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_node, ManagerialReview, FinalDecision] With order: loop_node --> SkillAssessment --> xor_node --> ManagerialReview --> FinalDecision"
