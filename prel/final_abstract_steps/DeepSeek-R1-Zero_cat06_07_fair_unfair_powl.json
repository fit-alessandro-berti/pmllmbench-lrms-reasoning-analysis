    "Text": "Based on the process description, the steps are ordered as follows: 1. `ReceiveApplication` is followed by `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck`. If there is missing information, the process loops back to `RequestMoreInfo` until the resume is complete. 2. After `ResumeParsingAndInitialDataCheck`, the `SkillAssessment` occurs where a score threshold determines if an applicant proceeds or is disqualified. 3. After `SkillAssessment`, there is an XOR choice where either a `CulturalFitCheck` is performed (standard path) or a `CommunityAffiliationCheck` is performed if the applicant is part of a specific local group (\"Global Business Leaders Club\" or local resident), which provides an implicit score adjustment. 4. Both `CulturalFitCheck` and `CommunityAffiliationCheck` lead to `ManagerialReview` where the hiring manager makes a review. 5. `ManagerialReview` leads to `FinalDecision`."
