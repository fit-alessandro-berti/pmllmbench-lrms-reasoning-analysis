    "Text": "The normative process starts with Receive order, then Check inventory. After that, if inventory is sufficient, the steps are: Authorize payment, Package items, Ship order, Close order. If inventory is insufficient, it goes to Cancel order, then Close order. Key constraints mentioned are: Authorize payment must be after Check inventory and before packaging. Package items after authorization and before shipping. Ship order after packaging and not after cancellation. Close order is the final step in all cases."

    "Text": "Now, lets go through each case one by one. Case 1: Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Package, Ship, Close. This seems to follow the correct sequence for sufficient inventory. All steps are in order. No violations here. Case 2: Activities: Receive, Check, Package, Authorize, Ship, Close. Wait, here they packaged items before authorizing payment. According to the rules, package should come after authorization. So this is a violation. The order is Check, then Package, then Authorize. Thats wrong because payment should be authorized before packaging. So this case is violating the constraint that package must be after authorization. Case 3: Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Cancel, Ship, Close. After canceling, they ship the order. But the norm says that once canceled, you shouldnt proceed with shipping. The cancellation should lead directly to Close. So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Also, the order here is Check, Authorize, Cancel, then Ship. But after cancellation, shipping is not allowed. So this is a problem. Case 4: Activities: Receive, Check, Cancel, Close. This follows the correct path for insufficient inventory. No issues here. Case 5: Activities: Receive, Check, Authorize, Ship, Close. Here, they ship before packaging. The norm says shipping must be after packaging. So this is a violation. They skipped the package step and went directly from authorize to ship. Thats not allowed."

    "Text": "So the violating cases are 2, 3, and 5. Let me double-check each one. Case 2: Package before Authorize. Yes, thats against the rule that package comes after authorize. Case 3: After Cancel, they Ship. The process says after cancel, you should Close, not Ship. So thats a violation. Case 5: Ship before Package. Correct, because packaging must come before shipping. I think thats all. Cases 2, 3, and 5 have issues. Let me make sure theres no other violations. For example, in Case 3, after canceling, they have Ship. The description says that once canceled, its illogical to continue with fulfillment activities like packaging or shipping. So shipping after cancellation is definitely a violation. Yes, thats correct. So the answer should list these three cases and explain each violation."
