According to the rules, package should come after authorization. So this is a violation. The order is Check, then Package, then Authorize. That's wrong because payment should be authorized before packaging. So this case is violating the constraint that package must be after authorization."

The cancellation should lead directly to Close. So shipping after cancellation is a violation. Also, the order here is Check, Authorize, Cancel, then Ship. But after cancellation, shipping is not allowed. So this is a problem."

The description says that once canceled, it's illogical to continue with fulfillment activities like packaging or shipping. So shipping after cancellation is definitely a violation."
