Our goal is to merge them into a single event log by matching events that represent the same activity, and to handle events that are only in one log. Steps: 1. Parse both logs into a list of dictionaries for easier manipulation. Log A: events = [ {'timestamp': '2023-10-10T10:00:00Z', 'event_type': 'Order Received', 'order_id': 'Order#1234'}, ... ] Log B: events = [ {'timestamp': '2023-10-10T09:59:58Z', 'event_name': 'OrderReceived', ...}, ... ]"

For each event in Log A, we'll look for a matching event in Log B (if any) and merge them. If no match, we keep the event from Log A. Similarly, events in Log B that are not matched with any in Log A will be included as from System B only. Use the timestamp from Log A as the primary timestamp when available."
