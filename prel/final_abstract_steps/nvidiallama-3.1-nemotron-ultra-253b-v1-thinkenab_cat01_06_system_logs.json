    "Text": "Starting with Case Identification. The main challenge here is grouping events into coherent cases. A case should represent a logical unit of work. Looking at the log, the user interacts with different documents and applications. For example, they work on Document1.docx, then switch to email, then to a PDF, Excel, and back. So, each document they work on could be a separate case. Like, editing Document1.docx would be one case, handling an email another, working on the PDF another, and so on."

Then they switch to Chrome for email, which would be another case. Then to Adobe Acrobat for the PDF, then Excel, then back to Document1, then back to Quarterly_Report."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, looking at the log entry: when they switch to Chrome, the Window is \"Email - Inbox\". Then there's a CLICK action with \"Open Email about Annual Meeting\". So maybe each email opened is a separate case, but the window title remains \"Email - Inbox\". This complicates things because the window title isn't unique. So perhaps in this case, the Case ID is determined not just by the window title but also by the specific action (like opening a particular email)."

So DOC1 case starts here.\n\nThen, the user works on Document1.docx (TYPING, SAVE), then SWITCHes to Chrome (Email - Inbox), opens an email (CLICK, Action=Open Email...), which would start a new case (EMAIL1). Then, after sending the email, they SWITCH to Adobe Acrobat (Report_Draft.pdf)  case PDF1. Then SWITCH to Excel (Budget_2024.xlsx)  case EXCEL1.

So perhaps SWITCH events are used to determine case boundaries but are not themselves activities in the process. Or maybe they are included as \"Switch to [App]\" but that might not be meaningful. Alternatively, since the user is moving from one case to another, the SWITCH is the end of one case and the start of another. But in the event log, each event belongs to a case. So SWITCH events might not be part of any case, or they could be part of the previous or next case. This is a bit tricky."
