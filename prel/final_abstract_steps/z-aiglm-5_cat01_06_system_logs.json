Observation: This looks like the start of something, but it switches away immediately at 09:00. Or maybe it's background preparation. 09:00:00: FOCUS on Document1.docx (Word). Observation: The user switches context from the Quarterly Report to Document1. 09:00:30 - 09:01:00: TYPING in Document1.docx. 09:01:15: SAVE Document1.docx. Interpretation: This sequence (Focus -> Type -> Save) looks like a complete unit of work on Document1.docx."

Process Mining Logic: Usually, a case is a process instance. If I define the case as Processing a specific file, then this is a continuation of Case 1. The activity: Inserting reference to budget. This implies the user went to Excel to get data/verify something and came back to Word. This suggests Case 1 is still open, or at least related."

    "Text": "Final Review and Formatting: Case Identification Logic: Grouping by file/document name works best here. For the email, I synthesized a specific Case ID (Email_Annual_Meeting) based on the action metadata because Email - Inbox is too generic. Activity Naming: I used generic but process-relevant names (Draft Content, Save Changes, Send Email). This looks solid. It captures the flow, the interruptions, the specific objects, and transforms low-level logs into business-relevant steps."
