create Order Created event Order Lines table for each line item create Item Picked event Delivery table for each delivery record of the order create two events Dispatched and Arrived Invoice table for each invoice of the order create Invoice Issued event Payments table for each payment linked to an invoice of the order create Payment Received event Now for each of these events extract the data Now to build the event log We need to union all these events sorted by order id and timestamp Let me outline each event for each order Starting with Order one thousand one Events Order Created order date Item Picked ITEM zero zero one item picking date Item Picked ITEM zero zero two item picking date Order Dispatched delivery dispatch date Order Arrived delivery arrival date Invoice Issued invoice issue date Payment Received payment date Order one thousand two Order Created Two items picked ITEM zero zero three and ITEM zero zero five Two deliveries DLV five thousand two and DLV five thousand

delivery invoice or payment Order one thousand five Order Created Two items picked One delivery DLV five thousand five One invoice INV one thousand five One payment PAY two thousand five Now for each event map attributes and resources Now the challenge is to join all tables and collect all events Now lets start constructing the event log First the Order Created events For each order in Orders table Case ID order id Activity Order Created Timestamp order date Resource sales person id joined to Resources to get name and role Other attributes customer type order priority So Order one thousand one Alice Brown SP zero zero one role Sales Person Order one thousand two Bob Smith SP zero zero two Order one thousand three Bob Smith SP zero zero two Order one thousand four Charlie Kim SP zero zero three Order one thousand five Alice Brown SP zero zero one Now Order Lines events Each line item Item Picked event Timestamp item picking date Resource picker id warehouse staff Attributes item id quantity item category from Products picker name and role Join Order Lines with Products on item id Delivery events Each delivery record two events Timestamps dispatch and arrival Resource carrier id Attributes delivery note carrier name Invoice events Each invoice timestamp invoice issue date Resource billing person id Attribute invoice amount Payments events Each payment timestamp payment date Attributes payment method payment reference Resource Payments table doesnt have a resource id so leave blank Now compiling all events Lets start building each row Order one thousand one Order

items Order Arrived date Invoice Issued date Irene Park five hundred Payment Received date Credit Card REF CC seven eight nine Now all events need to be ordered per timestamp Now compiling all these into a table But need to make sure that all events are in chronological order for each case For example Order one thousand two has two deliveries The dispatch dates are and The arrival dates are later Now to structure each row with Case ID Activity Name Timestamp Resource Other Attributes For Other Attributes perhaps include For Order Created customer type order priority For Item Picked item id quantity item category For Dispatched and Arrived carrier id delivery note For Invoice invoice amount For Payment payment method payment reference Now lets build each row Starting with Order one
