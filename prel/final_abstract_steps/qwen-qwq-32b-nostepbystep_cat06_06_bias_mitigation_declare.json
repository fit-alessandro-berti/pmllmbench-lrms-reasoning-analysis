So in the 'coexistence' section, add an entry for FinalDecision with ManualReview as a key. That would enforce that whenever FinalDecision is present, ManualReview must also be present in the trace. This would ensure that when a final decision is made, there was a manual review, which could reduce bias.\n\n2. **Non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision**:\nAdd a non-succession constraint between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision. This would prevent the process from going directly from checking the race to the decision, requiring an intermediate step. So adding non-succession between CheckApplicantRace and FinalDecision.\n\n3. **Response from CheckApplicantRace to BiasMitigationCheck**:\nAdd a response constraint that CheckApplicantRace must be followed by BiasMitigationCheck. So in 'response' section:\n\n\"response\": {\n    \"CheckApplicantRace\": {\"BiasMitigationCheck\": {\"support\": 1.0, \"confidence\": 1.0}}\n}"
