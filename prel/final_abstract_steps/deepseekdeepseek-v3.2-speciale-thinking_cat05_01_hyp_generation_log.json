    "Text": "That suggests a possible policy violation shipping before credit check That might indicate missing Validate Stock and out-of-order Confirm We can also hypothesize about resource assignments different roles performing activities not appropriate But resources seem consistent per role department However we can see that FinanceTeam 02 is a Cashier and receives payment which is okay but in case 1004 Receive Payment is before Invoice which might be a prepayment Thus the anomalies are interesting"
