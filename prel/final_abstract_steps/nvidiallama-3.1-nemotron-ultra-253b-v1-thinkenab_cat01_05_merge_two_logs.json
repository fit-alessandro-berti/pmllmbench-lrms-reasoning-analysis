Or maybe the primary log is Log A, so use its timestamp. Wait, in the context, Log A is considered the primary timeline, but timestamps may reflect when events are received. So maybe Log As timestamps are the primary. But the example shows merged events with timestamps from Log B. Hmm, perhaps the merged timestamp should be the earliest of the two. Or perhaps if theyre within tolerance, pick one. Lets see the sample: ... Looking at the sample output provided in the problems Final Output section: The first merged event is at 09:59:58Z (from Log B), so they chose the earlier timestamp.

Wait, perhaps the primary timeline refers to the sequence of events, but the timestamps are adjusted. This is a bit confusing. Lets look at the sample provided in the answer. Sample output for the first merged event: timestamp: 20231010T09:59:58Z, which is from Log B, even though Log As timestamp is 10:00:00. So the difference is 2 seconds. The sample merged them and took Log Bs timestamp. So even though Log A is the primary timeline, when merging, the timestamp from Log B is used. So maybe the approach is that for merged events, we take the earliest timestamp. Alternatively, the problem allows either, but the sample shows taking Log Bs timestamp. So perhaps in this case, when merging, we can use the timestamp from either log as long as they are within tolerance, but the sample suggests using the earliest one. ... But the main thing is that for events that are merged, their timestamps are aligned if within 2 seconds, and we can choose one. The sample shows that the first event from Log B is merged with Log As first event, using Log Bs timestamp. So following that approach, lets proceed."

Use Log Bs timestamp. Combine attributes: event_type from Log A (Order Received) and event_name from Log B (OrderReceived). Also, include user_id, resource_id, notes from Log B.
