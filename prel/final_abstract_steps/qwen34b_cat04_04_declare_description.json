So the process is: receive application, preliminary check, then gather documents. Then, after gathering documents, either go to Quality_Assurance_Review or Authorize_Contract_Terms?

But the 'coexistence' of Gather_Additional_Documents leads to Authorize_Contract_Terms, which might be a parallel path, but that would require that both steps are done.
