    "Text": "First, I need to understand the sample data. Looking at CaseID A1 and B2, I notice a clear sequence: starting with material retrieval, then scanning, placement, alignment, preheating, welding, quality checks, coating, and final inspection. The timestamps show tight clustering within each phase - like the first four events for A1 all happen within 15 seconds of each other."

    "Text": "Hmm, the key patterns I'm seeing: - Material prep events (retrieve, scan, place) all involve Operator A handling raw materials - Alignment and preheating seem like setup before welding - Welding activities are consecutive and performed by the same operator - Quality checks (sensor measurement + visual inspection) form a distinct verification phase"
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should consider resource types too. Operators handle preparation and assembly, while sensors and machines handle specialized tasks like heating or coating. The Measure weld integrity by Quality Sensor #1 clearly belongs to quality control, not assembly."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, is preheating part of material prep or welding setup? Looking at the sequence, it immediately precedes welding and uses a heating unit - so probably part of the welding preparation phase. The coating and drying also form a natural pair since drying is specifically for the coating."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "For naming, I'll avoid generic terms like Step 1. Material Preparation fits the initial phase perfectly. Welding Assembly captures both tool prep and actual welding. The quality checks should be Automated Quality Check since it starts with sensor measurement, followed by Final Visual Inspection as a separate human check."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The user mentioned domain relevance, so I'll use manufacturing terminology like Subassembly for the welding phase since it's creating a component part. Also noting that coating application and drying are inseparable - calling it Protective Coating Application covers both."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "I wonder if the user needs this for process optimization? The grouping could help identify bottlenecks. Like if coating takes disproportionately long, they'd see it as one high-level step. Should mention that in rationale."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Better double-check temporal proximity. For A1, coating application (08:01:30) and drying (08:01:45) are 15s apart - tight enough to group. But welding events span 15s (08:01:05-08:01:20), which is reasonable for manual assembly."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Final structure should have 5 clear phases based on logical progression: prep -> welding setup -> assembly -> coating -> quality. The sample shows consistent patterns across cases, so this should scale to the full log."
