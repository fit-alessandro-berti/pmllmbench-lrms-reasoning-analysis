    "Text": "For naming Ill avoid generic terms like Step 1 Material Preparation fits the initial phase perfectly Welding Assembly captures both tool prep and actual welding The quality checks should be Automated Quality Check since it starts with sensor measurement followed by Final Visual Inspection as a separate human check The user mentioned domain relevance so Ill use manufacturing terminology like Subassembly for the welding phase since its creating a component part Also noting that coating application and drying are inseparable calling it Protective Coating Application covers both"
