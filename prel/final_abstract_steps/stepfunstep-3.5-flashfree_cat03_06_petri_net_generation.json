Document Verification (DV) - If documents are incomplete, we go to Re-Document Submission (RDS) and then back to DV. 3. Fraud Check (FC) - If doubts, we go to In-depth Investigation (II) and then back to FC (can happen multiple times). 4. Claim Assessment (CA) 5. Approval (AP) 6. Payment (P) 7. Notification (N) 8.
