This is a bit ambiguous, but given the context of the problem, I think we need to model the rules such that each activity is present in the relevant rules with support and confidence set to 1.0. ... I'll have to make some assumptions."

    "Text": "In a linear process, the main rules would be: - The process starts with IG (init) - Each activity must follow the previous one (precedence and succession) - There's a chain of activities from IG to FL (so chainprecedence and chainsuccession) ... 'precedence' would be a dict where each activity (except FL) has a precedence to the next activity. ... 'succession' each activity is immediately followed by the next."

    "Text": "This model has: - 'init' with IG. - 'existence' with all activities. - 'precedence' with all activities except FL (since they must precede the next). - 'succession' with all activities except FL. - 'chainprecedence' and 'chainsuccession' with all activities except FL (the chain ends at FL). ... This seems like a plausible model."
