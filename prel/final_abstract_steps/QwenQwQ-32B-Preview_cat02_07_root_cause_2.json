    "Text": "To mitigate these performance issues here are some suggestions 1 Improve Documentation Process Streamline the process for requesting and receiving additional documents This could involve providing clearer instructions to claimants or using digital tools to make document submission easier and faster 2 Train Staff on Complex Claims Provide additional training for staff handling highcomplexity claims to make them more efficient in evaluating and processing these cases 3 Resource Allocation Ensure that regions or departments handling higher volumes of complex claims have sufficient resources such as additional staff or support personnel 4 Prioritization Based on Complexity Implement a system to prioritize claims based on their complexity Lower complexity claims can be processed quickly while higher complexity claims may require more time and attention 5 Regular Review and Optimization Periodically review the claims processing workflow to identify bottlenecks and areas for improvement Use data analytics to monitor processing times and correlate them with attributes like resource region and complexity"
