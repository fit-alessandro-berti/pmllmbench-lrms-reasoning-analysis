Maybe a better way is to look for three consecutive events in the correct order. Alternatively, maybe a windowed approach where we can look at the next or previous rows.

So, adding to the WHERE clause: AND er3.timestamp  er2.timestamp  INTERVAL '5 days' Wait, but in DuckDB, the interval might be handled as a time difference. Let me confirm the syntax. In DuckDB, the interval can be added using INTERVAL '5 days', so the difference between timestamps can be compared to that. Wait, er3.timestamp  er2.timestamp would give an interval.

So perhaps adding a DISTINCT in the CTE's SELECT. Wait, the CTE's SELECT er1.case_id would return the case_id for every occurrence of such a triplet.
