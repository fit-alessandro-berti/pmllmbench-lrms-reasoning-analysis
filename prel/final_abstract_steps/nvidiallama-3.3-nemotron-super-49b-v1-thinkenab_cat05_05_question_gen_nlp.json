    "Text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants 20 open-ended questions based on the complex supply chain described. First, I need to thoroughly understand the process from R&D to consumer delivery. The supply chain involves multiple international suppliers, manufacturing in Malaysia, distribution across regions, varied logistics, and digital systems."

    "Text": "The questions should probe for insights, potential problems, improvement strategies, and decision implications. I should avoid yes no questions and make them thought provoking. Let's break down the process into stages: R&D, procurement, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, and post sale activities."

    "Text": "For each stage, think about possible issues. For example, in procurement, supplier reliability and lead times could be concerns. Manufacturing in Malaysia might have labor or regulatory challenges. Logistics involve transport modes (air vs sea) and JIT strategies. Distribution centers handle different markets with varying demands. Post sale includes warranty, recalls, and sustainability."

    "Text": "Also, cross functional aspects like data analytics, currency exchange, time zones, and compliance are important. Need to consider risks such as component shortages, natural disasters, or regulatory changes. Strategic questions about balancing cost and speed, technology integration, and sustainability initiatives."

    "Text": "Wait, let me ensure I cover all parts. R&D: How do design changes affect suppliers? Procurement: Managing multiple suppliers with different terms. Manufacturing: Efficiency in 24 7 operations. Logistics: Air vs sea tradeoffs. Distribution: Inventory strategies for different markets. Technology: Role of AI in forecasting. Compliance: Environmental and labor laws across regions. Risks: Pandemics, political instability. Improvement: Continuous initiatives. Financial: Currency fluctuations. Customer Impact: VIP shipments vs general."

    "Text": "Make sure questions are varied and not repetitive. Check if 20 is reached without overlapping. Maybe categorize them mentally: supply, manufacturing, logistics, distribution, technology, risks, strategy, finance, customer, sustainability. That could help distribute the questions evenly."
