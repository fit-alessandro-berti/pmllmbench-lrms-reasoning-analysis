Focus on conceptual understanding."

Coordinator reviews docs (deeds, compliance, inspections). Missing docs -> request updates. Verified -> enter into DB (sq ft, units, location, amenities, price). * *Step 2: Manager Assignment.* ... * *General:* Multiple decision points, stakeholders, exceptions (insurance, custom clauses), communication tracking (email, CRM, PM tools)."

Is it a form, a call, an email? * *SLAs/Timing:* How long does each step take? Are there deadlines? * *Decision Logic:* How is workload measured for PM assignment? Who makes the final call on pricing? * *Exceptions:* What happens if a landlord refuses repairs? What if no tenant is found? * *Roles:* Who is the Property Coordinator? Is this a distinct role from the PM? What if the PM is unavailable? * *Systems:* You mentioned CRM/PM tools, but how do hand-offs happen? Is it manual or automated? * *Feedback Loops:* If an audit fails, does the process restart? * *Metrics:* How do they measure success of onboarding?"

Is this automated or a manual management decision? * *Draft 4 (Exceptions):* What if the inspection fails? * *Refinement 4 (Exception handling):* You mentioned inspectors might find issues. What is the protocol if a landlord is unwilling or unable to make the required repairs? Does the onboarding stop there? * *Draft 5 (Audit):* What happens if the compliance officer says no? * *Refinement 5 (Process Flow):* Regarding the final quality checks, if the compliance officer or financial analyst flags an issue, does the process revert to a previous stage, or is there a remediation path?"
