However, in the current model, the PO is in the parallel block so it can be created at any time relative to the other steps like after receiving goods, which is wrong.

The parallel block is incorrect because it allows any order of these steps."

Receiving the invoice before receiving goods: not allowed because receive_invoice is after receive_goods. Matching the invoice before receiving the invoice: not allowed because match_invoice is after receive_invoice. Creating the PO after receiving goods: not allowed because create_po is before receive_goods. Therefore, the corrected model enforces the intended sequence."

This prevents any out-of-order execution, such as paying the invoice before receiving the goods or before matching the invoice, and also prevents creating the PO after receiving the goods. Thus, the model now accurately represents the intended Procure-to-Pay process."
