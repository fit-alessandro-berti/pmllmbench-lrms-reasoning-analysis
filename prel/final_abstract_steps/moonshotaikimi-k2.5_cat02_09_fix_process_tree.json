You cant Receive Invoice before Receiving Goods (usually invoice arrives after goods, or around same time, but definitely PO must exist first). 4. You cant Match Invoice to PO before receiving both the invoice and the goods (usually 3-way match: PO, Goods Receipt, Invoice). 5. You cant Pay Invoice before matching it."
