    "Text": "Wait the problem says Based on the triage classification there is an exclusive decision on the type of initial diagnostic tests If the patient is suspected of a cardiovascular issue they perform a Comprehensive ECG CE Otherwise if suspicion is more general or noncardiac they perform a Full Blood Panel FBP Ah so the choice between CE and FBP is conditional on the triage classification TC Therefore the X node cannot be used directly here because the choice depends on TCs value But the problems operators dont include conditionals This is a problem Wait maybe the X node can be used with a condition But according to the problems description the operators are fixed Therefore this suggests that the problems operators do not support conditionals and thus the scenario as described cannot be modeled with the given operators But the problem says to model it using the given operators Therefore perhaps the problem expects that the choice between CE and FBP is unconditional but the descriptions conditional is a mistake or perhaps Im misunderstanding Alternatively maybe the problem allows for the X node to be part of a loop that checks the condition Hmm but thats not clear Alternatively perhaps the problem expects that the choice between CE and FBP is unconditional and the descriptions conditional is a mistake Or perhaps the triage classification TC is a leaf node and the X nodes choice between CE and FBP is based on the TCs value But how to model that with the given operators Since theres no conditional operator perhaps the problem expects that the X node is used with the TC as one of the options Wait that doesnt make sense Hmm this is a problem Since the problem requires using the given operators perhaps the scenarios conditional choice is a mistake and we should proceed with the X node between CE and FBP unconditionally Given the time constraints Ill proceed under the assumption that the choice between CE and FBP is unconditional and use the X node between them"
