    "Text": "Hmm, looking at the tables... There's Orders, Order Lines, Delivery, Invoice, Payments, and some optional tables for products and resources. The key is to map each step in the order lifecycle into events with timestamps and activities. Starting with the Orders table - each row is an order creation. So for each order_id, I should have an Order Created event with the order_date as timestamp. That seems straightforward. Next, the Order Lines table has item_picking_date. ... Then Delivery table has dispatch and arrival dates. For each delivery record (per order), I can create two events: Order Dispatched with delivery_dispatch_date and Order Arrived with delivery_arrival_date. ... Invoices table has invoice_issue_date. Each invoice should be an Invoice Issued event. ... Payments table has payment_date. Each payment is a Payment Received event."

    "Text": "Now, chronological order is critical. I need to make sure the events for each order are in time sequence. Let me think about typical order flow: 1. Order Created (order_date) 2. Items Picked (item_picking_date)... 3. Delivery Dispatched (delivery_dispatch_date) 4. Delivery Arrived (delivery_arrival_date) 5. Invoice Issued (invoice_issue_date) 6. Payment Received (payment_date) But sometimes invoices might be issued before delivery? Wait, in the data, for order 1001: order_date 2024-01-01, invoice issued 2024-01-06, delivery arrived 2024-01-05. So delivery arrives before invoice? That seems odd. Maybe the business has different rules. I have to go with the data given."

For payments, maybe the billing clerk is the actor? Or the payment method? Wait, the Payments table doesn't have a resource_id column. The Resources table has resource_id like BL-001 for billing clerks. But payments are handled by the billing clerk who issues the invoice? Not sure. ... To be safe, I'll put Payment System for payments since there's no specific user ID."

The Order Arrived event uses delivery_arrival_date as the timestamp. The Items Picked events are created per item line, as the picking dates differ per item. For orders with multiple deliveries, each delivery's dispatch and arrival are separate events. The activity names are as specified (e.g., Order Dispatched for delivery_dispatch_date, Order Arrived for delivery_arrival_date)."
