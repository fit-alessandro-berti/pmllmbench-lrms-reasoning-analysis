Each case_id groups events that belong to one process instance (or case). The query should filter out any cases containing more than six events, returning only the events from cases that have six or fewer events in total. In other words, we need to count number of events per case id and then exclude those with count > 6, then return full set for remaining ones."

Ill now produce code: SELECT e.* FROM event_log AS e JOIN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ) AS valid_cases ON e.case_id = valid_cases.case_id; This query should do what we want."

But since the problem says craft a DuckDB SQL query, both ways are valid if supported by DuckDB version. I can also use exists but that might be less efficient, so join is simpler."
