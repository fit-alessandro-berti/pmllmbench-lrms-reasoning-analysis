    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So the answer is the first query Alternatively the CTE version is also correct But the problem says craft a DuckDB SQL query so either is acceptable but perhaps the first is more concise Wait but in DuckDB does the GROUP BY require the HAVING clause to be after The syntax is standard SQL so thats okay Another possible optimization using EXISTS Not sure But the first approach is straightforward Therefore the correct SQL query is the one with the subquery in the WHERE clause"
