    "Text": "Wait, maybe the problem is simpler than I'm making it out to be. Perhaps the Petri net can be constructed with the initial marking and final marking as specified, and the transitions allowing loops through places like RDS and II. So, the Petri net would look like this: Start transitions to CR. CR transitions to DV. DV can transition to FC or RDS. If DV transitions to FC: FC transitions to CA. CA transitions to AP. AP transitions to P. P transitions to N. N transitions to CL. CL transitions to Sink. If DV transitions to RDS: RDS transitions to DV. So, the process can loop between DV and RDS. Similarly, perhaps after FC, there's a transition that can send the token back to FC via II. Wait, but II is a place. So, after FC, if more investigation is needed, the token goes to II. II can then transition back to FC. So, the Petri net would have: Start -> CR. CR -> DV. DV has two transitions: one to FC and one to RDS. FC has a transition to II. II transitions back to FC. Wait, but this would require multiple tokens in FC and II. Hmm, perhaps the solution is to have multiple transitions that can loop. But with the initial marking as Start:1, it's unclear. Wait, maybe I should proceed step by step, ignoring the loops for now, and then see how to model them. Start:1. Start transitions to CR. CR transitions to DV. DV transitions to FC. FC transitions to CA. CA transitions to AP. AP transitions to P. P transitions to N. N transitions to CL. CL transitions to Sink. This would represent the case where all steps are completed without any loops. But in reality, after DV, there's a chance to go back to RDS, and after FC, there's a chance to go back to II. So, I need to model these loops. Perhaps I can model RDS as a transition that, when fired, sends the token back to DV. Similarly, II as a transition that sends the token back to FC. So, the Petri net would have: Start -> CR. CR -> DV. DV -> FC. DV -> RDS. FC -> CA. FC -> II. CA -> AP. AP -> P. P -> N. N -> CL. CL -> Sink. RDS -> DV. II -> FC. Now, in this structure, after DV, the token can go to FC or RDS. If it goes to RDS, RDS transitions back to DV, allowing another cycle. If it goes to FC, FC can send the token to II, which sends it back to FC. Wait, but II is a place. So, II needs to transition back to FC. So, II is a place with a transition that goes back to FC. Similarly, RDS is a place with a transition that goes back to DV. This way, after DV, the token can go to either FC or RDS. If it goes to RDS, the token goes back to DV. If it goes to FC, the token can go to II, which sends it back to FC. But in this setup, each transition can only fire once per token. So, if the token is in FC, it can go to CA or II. If it goes to II, it can fire again, sending it back to FC, thus allowing another cycle. But with only one token, this would require multiple firings of the same transitions, which isn't possible. Hmm, perhaps the initial marking needs to have multiple tokens to handle the loops. But the problem statement says the initial marking is Start:1. So, I'm not sure how to model loops with just one token."
