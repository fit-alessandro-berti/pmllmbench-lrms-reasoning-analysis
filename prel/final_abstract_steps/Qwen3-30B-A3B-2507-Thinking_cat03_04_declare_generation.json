    "Text": "We need to define the declarative constraints for the process. Since the problem does not specify the exact constraints, we have to infer typical constraints for such a process. However, note: the problem does not provide specific constraints. Therefore, we must make reasonable assumptions for a typical process."

    "Text": "We expect that 'Idea Generation' must exist (i.e., every trace must have at least one IG). -> This corresponds to the 'existence' constraint for activity 'IG'. Similarly, we expect that 'Final Launch (FL)' must exist. The problem says 'each product idea goes through a series of steps', so we assume that the process is well-defined and FL is the last step. The existence constraint for an activity means that the activity must occur at least once in the trace. Since we assume all steps occur, we will set existence for all activities."

    "Text": "For the keys like 'precedence', the value is a dictionary with keys being the activities... This implies that for a constraint like 'precedence', the dictionary key is the activity that must be preceded by another activity, but the other activity is not specified in the key? This is confusing. However, the standard way in pm4py for the DECLARE model is different. Given the ambiguity, and since the problem does not specify the exact constraints, we will make the following assumptions: We will define the constraints that are typical and that can be represented in the given structure. For the two-activity constraints, we will define them per the second activity (B) and assume that the first activity (A) is fixed by the process."

LT must be preceded by PC. UT must be preceded by LT. MP must be preceded by AG. FL must be preceded by MP. So we have 8 activities for precedence."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "The DECLARE model has both precedence and response. The difference is subtle and often context-dependent. Given the confusion, and since the problem lists both, we will use precedence for all the ordering constraints we want to express, and leave response as an empty dictionary. Similarly, for the other constraints like coexistence, responded_existence, succession etc., we will leave them as empty dictionaries as they are not explicitly described in the process."

We will set existence for all 10 activities, init for 'IG', and precedence for all activities except 'IG'. All other constraint types will have an empty dictionary as their value."
