Coordinator records property details into central database. 4. Assign a dedicated property manager based on workload, geography, experience, track record with special requirements. 5. Introductory call/meeting between manager and landlord to align expectations. 6. Schedule photographer and inspector. If issues found, work with landlord to fix them. 7. Marketing team creates listings, brochures, updates pricing models. 8. Activate the property in rental portal for tenants to apply. 9. Tenant screening: applications, credit checks, references, possibly negotiate terms if multiple applicants. 10. Finalize lease, collect deposit, schedule move-in. 11. Quality checks and audits by compliance, finance, IT departments."

Maybe ask about decision criteria for assigning managers. - Handling exceptions like special insurance or custom clauses in leases. How do they handle those exceptions? - Timing between steps—how long does each part take, especially if there's a delay due to missing docs or failed inspections? - Roles and responsibilities beyond the property manager? Like the coordinator, compliance officer, etc.—are these roles standardized across regions? - Communication tracking: how exactly is communication tracked? Maybe CRM details but user said not to ask about implementation. So focus on process aspects like ensuring continuity."
