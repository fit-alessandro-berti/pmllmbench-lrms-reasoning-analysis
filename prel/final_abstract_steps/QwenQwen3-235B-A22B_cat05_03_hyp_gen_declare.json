The precedence constraint for C requires it to be preceded by R. But in the intended process, C is preceded by N, which is after several steps. So the precedence constraint as stated is too lenient and allows C to come immediately after R, which skips all the steps in between. So thats another anomaly."

But in the intended process, R is the first step, so R will always be before C. However, the intended process also requires that other steps (A, E, P, N) occur before C. So the precedence constraint here is not sufficient to enforce the correct order. It only ensures that R is before C, but not the other steps. However, the problem here is that the DECLARE model may have conflicting constraints, not just missing ones. So the main issue is the noncoexistence between E and C, which directly contradicts the intended process. Additionally, the precedence constraint on C with R might not be conflicting but perhaps incomplete."

If the model allows C to be preceded by R, but in reality, C should come after N, which comes after P, etc., then the model allows C to be placed after R, skipping all the intermediate steps. So thats a problem. But the DECLARE models precedence constraint only enforces that R is before C, but doesnt enforce the correct sequence of all steps. However, the current model may not include constraints for all the steps. For example, theres no constraint that A must be preceded by R, or E by A, etc. So the anomalies here are the noncoexistence constraint between E and C, and the precedence constraint that allows C to be anywhere after R, without enforcing the full sequence."

So looking at the models constraints: The noncoexistence between E and C says they cannot both exist in the same trace.

The precedence constraint says that C must be preceded by R. Which in the intended process is true, but the problem is that the model allows C to come immediately after R, skipping A, E, etc. However, the model also has an existence constraint on C (every trace must have C), which in combination with the init constraint (R is first), so all traces start with R and have C. But the precedence constraint on C after R doesnt conflict with other constraints, but its insufficient to enforce the correct process.

Alternatively, they might have confused noncoexistence with a different constraint type. Incremental policy changes: If a previous policy prohibited evaluation and closure in the same process (now obsolete), the constraint wasnt removed during updates. Incomplete data: If historical data lacked traces with both E and C, the model might have incorrectly inferred their noncoexistence.

Coexistence of E and C: Check if traces have both E and C, which according to the intended process they should, but the model prohibits. C not preceded by N, P, E, A: Ensure that C follows N, which follows P, etc. But since the models precedence constraint only checks R before C, a query could check if C is preceded by all required steps. Evaluation without assignment: Since the responded existence constraint requires A before E, check for traces with E but no prior A.
