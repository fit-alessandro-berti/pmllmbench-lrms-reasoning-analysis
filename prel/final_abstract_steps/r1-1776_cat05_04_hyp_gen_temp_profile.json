The average time is about 25 hours, but the standard deviation is only 1 hour. Thats really low compared to the average. That seems odd because if the process is taking a day on average, youd expect some variation."

    "Text": "Why would it take so long? Maybe theres a backlog in sending notifications, or maybe some claims get stuck in a queue. Also, the high standard deviation means sometimes its faster, sometimes much slower. Could be manual processes here causing delays."

    "Text": "For hypotheses, the low standard deviation in R to P might be due to an automated process that schedules approvals rigidly, regardless of when evaluation happened. The long delay in P to N could be due to manual notifications that depend on staff availability, leading to bottlenecks. The quick A to C might indicate claims being closed without proper steps, possibly by certain adjusters or for specific claim types. The fast E to N could be an automated system but might bypass necessary approvals."

    "Text": "Now, for verification with SQL queries: For R to P anomaly: Check claims where the time from Receive to Approve is exactly around 25 hours with little variation. Group by claim_type or adjuster to see if its specific to certain cases. For P to N delay: Find claims where Approve to Notify takes longer than average and see if they correlate with certain regions or adjusters with high workloads. A to C quick closure: Look for claims closed shortly after assignment and check if those have any Evaluate or Approve events, which they shouldnt if they were closed prematurely. E to N speed: Check if Notify happens right after Evaluate without Approve in between, which might indicate skipped steps. Also, joining with adjusters and claims tables can help find patterns related to specialization or regions."
