Approve Request Looking at the Verify Documents activities: the first one at 09:20 is when the back office agent checks identity documents. The second one at 10:30 happens after the customer uploads an ID scan, so the agent re-checks now that they have the document. So the context here is different: first its checking physical documents, then after digital info is provided, its verifying again."

So the first is verifying existing documents, the second is confirming the new document is correct. Alternatively, maybe Verify Documents (Original) vs Verify Documents (Updated)? Hmm. Maybe Verify Initial Documentation and Verify Revised Documentation? Alternatively, the first is checking the original documents, the second is checking after the customer provided an ID scan. Wait, in the first case, the customer submits an ID scan in Submit Additional at 10:10. Then at 10:30, they verify again. So maybe the first Verify is for the original documents, and the second is to confirm the ID scan is valid. So perhaps Verify Original Documents and Verify ID Scan? Alternatively, maybe Verify Documents (Pre-Submission) and Verify Documents (Post-Submission). That could work. But maybe Verify Physical Documents and Verify Digital Submission? Alternatively, perhaps Verify Identity Documents (the first one) and Confirm ID Scan (the second). But the second activitys description says Agent re-checks documents now that ID scan is provided. So maybe the agent is verifying that the ID scan is correct. So maybe Verify ID Scan would be better for the second one."

    "Text": "Similarly, the Call Customer occurs twice in C001. The first call is because verification was incomplete, so the agent calls to request missing docs. The second call isnt present here, but in another case? Wait, in C001, the second call isnt there. Wait, in the first case, the calls are: First call: Verification incomplete, agent calls to request missing docs. Then no other calls in C001. The second call is in C002. Wait, in C002, there are two calls: at 09:00 and 09:50. The first is to clarify account discrepancy, the second is a follow-up. So for C001s Call Customer, its only once. Wait, maybe I made a mistake here. Let me check again. Wait, looking back at the event log for C001: The activities are: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer (once), Submit Additional, Verify Documents again, then Approve. Ah, so in C001, Call Customer occurs only once. Wait, the users log shows for C001, the third event is Call Customer at 09:45, and then the fifth event is another Verify Documents. So Call Customer only once in C001. The second occurrence of Call Customer is in C002 and C003. Wait, in C002, there are two Call Customer events. So perhaps the first case doesnt have a duplicate. Wait, maybe I misread. Let me check again. Looking at the log: For C001: The activities are: 1. Initiate Request 2. Verify Documents (09:20) 3. Call Customer (09:45) 4. Submit Additional (10:10) 5. Verify Documents (10:30) 6. Approve Request So Verify Documents occurs twice here, but Call Customer only once. So the duplicates are in Verify Documents and Call Customer in other cases. Wait, in C002, Call Customer occurs twice. Let me check: C002 has: Call Customer at 09:00 and 09:50. So two instances here. So Call Customer appears twice in C002. Similarly, in C003, Call Customer occurs once (at 11:50). So the duplicates are Verify Documents (appearing twice in C001, C002, C003) and Call Customer (twice in C002). Wait, lets check all cases for duplicates: Looking for activities that repeat in the same case: C001: Verify Documents twice. C002: Call Customer twice, Verify Documents once (no, in C002, Verify Documents is once, but Call Customer twice). Wait, C002s activities: Initiate Request, Verify Documents, Call Customer (twice), Adjust Account, Call Customer again, then Approve. So Call Customer is twice here. Verify Documents once. So Call Customer is duplicated here. C003 has Verify Documents twice (at 11:25 and 12:20), Call Customer once, and Adjust Account once. So Verify Documents duplicated here as well. So the activities that appear multiple times within the same case are: - Verify Documents (in C001, C003) - Call Customer (in C002)"

    "Text": "So these are the activities that need to be renamed to reflect their different contexts within the same case. Now, for each of these activities, I need to analyze their different contexts in the same case and come up with new names. Starting with Verify Documents in C001: First occurrence (09:20): Agent checks identity documents. The context is that the customer submitted a request via the portal, and the agent checks their identity documents (like ID proof). Second occurrence (10:30): After the customer submits an ID scan (in Submit Additional at 10:10), the agent re-checks the documents now that the ID scan is provided. Wait, actually, the Submit Additional is the customer uploading the ID scan. So after that, the agent checks again. So perhaps the first Verify Documents is checking the original documents, and the second is checking the new ID scan? Or maybe the first is verifying the physical documents, and the second is confirming the digital submission? Alternatively, maybe the first is verifying the customers original documents (like their ID), and the second is verifying the newly submitted ID scan. So the first is the initial verification, the second is a subsequent check after receiving the new document. So maybe Verify Original Documents and Verify Submitted Documents? Alternatively, Verify Identity Documents (first) and Confirm ID Scan (second). That might be better. Because the first is checking the original documents, the second is confirming the ID scan they just uploaded. In C003, Verify Documents occurs twice. Lets look at those: First Verify Documents (11:25): BranchOfficer checks physical verification of ID. The customer walked in, so the officer checks their ID physically. Second Verify Documents (12:20): After an Adjust Account (at 12:05), the officer re-verifies the docs. So this is a post-adjustment check. So the first is initial physical check, the second is re-checking after an account change. So maybe Verify Initial ID and Verify Post-Adjustment ID. Alternatively, Verify Physical ID and Verify Adjusted Account Documents. Hmm. The context here is that after the account was adjusted (due to missing info), they re-verify the documents. So the second Verify is to ensure that after the adjustment, the documents are still valid. So for C003s Verify Documents, the two instances are: 1. Initial physical check (when customer walked in) 2. After account adjustment, re-checking documents. So Verify Physical ID and Verify Adjusted Account Documents. Now for Call Customer in C002: First call at 08:15: Agent checks identity documents no, wait, the first call in C002 is at 08:05 Initiate Request, then Verify Documents at 08:15. The first call is at 09:00: Outbound call to clarify account discrepancy. The second call at 09:50 is a follow-up to confirm adjustments made. So the first call is to clarify the account discrepancy (maybe the customers account has an issue that wasnt resolved by the initial verification?), and the second is a follow-up after an adjustment was made. So the context of the call changes from clarifying an issue to confirming the adjustment was done. So the first call is Clarify Account Discrepancy and the second is Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up. Alternatively, maybe Clarify Issue and Confirm Change. Alternatively, the first call is to get more info to resolve the discrepancy, the second is to confirm that the adjustment was done as per the call. So for the Call Customer activities in C002, they should be renamed to reflect their purpose."

    "Text": "Now, proceeding to the other cases where Verify Documents occurs again. Lets check C003 again. Now, the plan is to rename each occurrence of the duplicated activities to a more context-specific name. Let me list all the duplicated activities across cases: 1. Verify Documents appears in: - C001 (twice) - C002 (once, but not duplicated here) Wait, in C002, Verify Documents occurs once. So the main duplicates are in C001 and C003 for Verify Documents. Wait, in C003, Verify Documents occurs twice. So for each case where the activity is duplicated, we need to rename each occurrence. Similarly, Call Customer is duplicated in C002 (twice). Other activities like Submit Additional only occur once per case. Adjust Account occurs once in C002 and C003, but not duplicated in the same case. Approve Request is once per case. So the activities to rename are: In C001: Verify Documents (twice) In C003: Verify Documents (twice) In C002: Call Customer (twice) Now, lets tackle each one. Starting with C001s Verify Documents: First occurrence (09:20): Agent checks identity documents. The customer just submitted a request via the portal, so the agent checks their ID documents. This is the initial verification. Second occurrence (10:30): After the customer submits an ID scan (in Submit Additional at 10:10), the agent re-checks. So this is verifying the new ID scan provided. So the first is verifying original documents, the second verifying the new submission. Possible names: First: Verify Original Identity Documents Second: Verify Submitted ID Scan Alternatively, Verify Customers Original Documents and Verify ID Scan Submission. Alternatively, Verify Initial Documentation and Verify Updated Documentation. Alternatively, Verify Identity Documents (Original) and Verify ID Scan (Post-Submission). I think the first two options are better. Lets go with Verify Original Documents and Verify Submitted ID Scan. In C003s Verify Documents: First at 11:25: BranchOfficer checks physical verification of ID. The customer walked in, so this is the initial check. Second at 12:20: After adjusting the account (at 12:05), the officer re-verifies the documents. So this is a post-adjustment check to ensure the documents are valid now. Possible names: First: Verify Physical ID Presentation Second: Verify Adjusted Account Documents Alternatively, Verify Initial Physical ID and Verify Post-Adjustment Documents. The second could be Verify Adjusted Account Documentation. In C002s Call Customer activities: First call (09:00): To clarify account discrepancy. The customers account had an issue that wasnt resolved by the initial verification (maybe the documents were missing?), so the agent calls to get more info. Second call (09:50): Follow-up to confirm that the adjustment made during the call was successful. Possible names: First: Clarify Account Discrepancy Second: Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up Alternatively, Clarify Issue and Confirm Adjustment."

    "Text": "Now, lets check other possible duplicates. Are there any other activities that repeat in the same case? Looking at C003s Verify Documents and Call Customer are the only ones with duplicates in their case. Now, proceeding to rename all instances. Starting with C001s Verify Documents: First occurrence (09:20): Verify Original Documents Second occurrence (10:30): Verify Submitted ID Scan In C003s Verify Documents: First (11:25): Verify Physical ID Second (12:20): Verify Adjusted Account Documents In C002s Call Customer: First (09:00): Clarify Account Discrepancy Second (09:50): Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up Now, lets check other possible activities. For example, Approve Request occurs once in each case, so no. Submit Additional once. Adjust Account occurs in C002 and C003 but not duplicated in the same case. So only the above activities need renaming. Now, lets apply these changes to the event log. Original log for C001: ... After renaming: ... Wait, but the second Verify Documents in C001 is now Verify Submitted ID Scan. For C003s Verify Documents: First: Verify Physical ID Second: Verify Adjusted Account Documents C002s Calls: First call: Clarify Account Discrepancy Second call: Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up Now, lets check other possible activities. For instance, in C003s Call Customer at 11:50: Original activity: Call Customer with context Customer stepped out. Officer calls to have them return. This is only one occurrence in C003, so no duplication here. So no need to rename. Similarly, Adjust Account in C003 is only once, so no duplication. Now, lets verify that all duplicates have been addressed: - In C001, Verify Documents became two different activities. - In C002, Call Customer became two different activities. - In C003, Verify Documents became two different activities. Other activities that were duplicated in the same case are now renamed. Now, the revised event log should look like this: For C001: ... For C002: The two Call Customer events become: First: Clarify Account Discrepancy at 09:00 Second: Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up at 09:50. So the lines: Original: ... Become: ... Wait, but the activity name is now Clarify Account Discrepancy and Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up, but the description might still be okay. Alternatively, maybe the second could be Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up with the description adjusted, but perhaps the activity name can be more concise. Alternatively, maybe Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up is sufficient. For C003s Verify Documents: First occurrence (11:25): Original: Verify Documents Verify Physical ID Second (12:20): Verify Adjusted Account Documents So the lines: Original: ... Become: ... Wait, maybe Verify Adjusted Account Documents is better than Verify Adjusted Account Docs. Alternatively, Verify Post-Adjustment Documents. Hmm, perhaps Verify Adjusted Account Documents is clearer. Now, lets check if all the renamed activities are correctly reflecting their contexts. For C001s Verify Original Documents makes sense as the initial check. The second Verify Submitted ID Scan is after the customer uploads the scan, so thats correct. In C002s calls: Clarify Account Discrepancy and Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up capture the different purposes. In C003s Verify Physical ID and Verify Adjusted Account Documents: the first is the initial check, the second after adjustment. Now, the justification for the names: - For C001s Verify Original Documents: The first verification is the agent checking the customers original identity documents submitted with the initial request. - Verify Submitted ID Scan: After the customer uploads an ID scan (via Submit Additional), the agent checks the submitted scan to confirm its validity. - In C002s Clarify Account Discrepancy: The call is to address an unresolved issue (discrepancy) in the account, seeking more information. - Confirm Adjustment Follow-Up: After the agent adjusted the account, this call confirms that the adjustment was done as discussed. - In C003s Verify Physical ID: The officer checks the customers physical ID presented at the branch. - Verify Adjusted Account Documents: After adjusting the account (due to missing info), the officer re-verifies the documents to ensure they align with the new account status. These names should now disambiguate the activities based on their context within the same case."
