    "Text": "First, I need to understand the requirements thoroughly. The problem has three main parts: 1. Identify cases with the exact sequence of three activities in a row: 'Approve Purchase Requisition', followed immediately by 'Create Order', then 'Confirm Order'. 2. Among those cases, only consider those where the time between Create Order and Confirm Order is more than 5 days. 3. Exclude all events from those cases. The final result should include all events except those in cases that both have the specific sequence and meet the timing condition."

    "Text": "How to detect the triplet in consecutive events? One approach is to: For each case, order the events by timestamp. For each activity, check if the next activity is the next in sequence, and the one after that is the next one. Alternatively, for each row in the event log, consider the next two rows in the same case but subsequent in time. If the current activity is Approve, next is Create, next is Confirm, and the time between the Create and Confirm is over 5 days, then the case is to be excluded."

    "Text": "Using LEAD() to calculate the activity of the next event and the one after that seems like a clean way to implement this. For example, the subquery could calculate next_activity_1 (the activity after current) and next_activity_2 (the activity after next) for all rows."

    "Text": "Testing edge cases: If a case has the three activities but time between Create and Confirm is exactly 5 days, it shouldn't be selected. Similarly, if the activity order is correct but the time is less, that case is not excluded. Also, if the triplet appears multiple times in a case but one of them meets the timing, then the case should be excluded. Another possible edge case is where the triplet occurs but not consecutively. For example, between the first Approve and Create there is another activity. In that case, the LEAD would not capture as the next activity after the Approve is not Create, so it's fine."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "The original approach with LEAD is better in that it implicitly requires that the next activities are the ones, which only happens if there are no intervening steps. Because the LEAD function jumps to the immediate next row. So if there's another event in between, e.g., another activity between the Approve and Create, then in that case, e1.activity would be Approve, but the LEAD would return that intervening activity's name instead of Create, so the triplet check would fail. Hence the first approach ensures there's no other events in between."
