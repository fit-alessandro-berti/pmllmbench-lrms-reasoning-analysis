    "Text": "First, I'll identify the core process flow from the most common steps mentioned across all interviews. Mary's account seems the most detailed for the standard path. Then I'll map out the key decision points and exceptions, especially from Rita and Karen's inputs. The roles are clearly defined: Accounts Payable Clerk, Purchasing Officer, Department Manager, Supervisor, and Supplier Manager."

    "Text": "I should note uncertainties where accounts differ slightly, like whether Purchasing confirms before or after logging, but the overall sequence is consistent. The textual output should be structured with clear sections for activities, gateways, roles, and artifacts, with notes on variations. The escalation paths and exception handling are critical to include since they're emphasized in the interviews."
