Since C003 was rejected at 715 (which is below the threshold for others?), but C001 and C004 were approved at 720 and 700 after adjustments. Wait, C004s adjusted score is 700, which is lower than C001s 720, but they both got approved. So the adjustment isnt just about the score level but might be about meeting certain criteria."

    "Text": "I think the main bias is the community group adjustment. Its favoring applicants who are members of Highland Civic Darts Club by giving them an extra 10 points. This could lead to underrepresentation of other groups in the loan approval process. To summarize: - Bias manifests through the +10 (Community) adjustment only for cases with Highland Civic Darts Club as community group. - This favors individuals with this specific community affiliation over others who might have similar creditworthiness. - Non-local residents without community groups (C003) face higher rejection risk. - The adjustment might not be transparent or explainable, leading to distrust in the system."

For example, if the Highland Civic Darts Club is a small group, it might not be representative, so the bias could be against a large portion of the population who dont belong to such groups.
