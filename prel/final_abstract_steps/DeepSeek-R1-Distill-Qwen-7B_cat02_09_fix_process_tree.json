The current model is underfitting, meaning it allows some unwanted behaviors. The desired order is a strict sequence: create a purchase requisition, then approve it, create a purchase order, receive goods, receive an invoice, match it to the PO, pay the invoice, and finally close the case."

    "Text": "Looking at the current model, after create_req and approve_req, there is a parallel block that includes create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, and pay_invoice. That means those activities can happen in any order after approval, which isnt correct. For example, paying the invoice before receiving goods is allowed, which is wrong."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I should adjust the parallel_block. Instead of having all those activities in parallel, they should be in a sequence. So the corrected structure would be create_req approve_req create_po receive_goods receive_invoice match_invoice pay_invoice close_case."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
