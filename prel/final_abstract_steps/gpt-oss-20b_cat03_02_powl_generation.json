After that QA and SA in partial order (concurrent but both before GLA). GLA after QA & SA."

Then loop node: - bnc = Transition(label=Base Network Configuration) - dr = Transition(label=Debug & Reconfigure) loop_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.LOOP, children=[bnc, dr]) After loop_node completes (stable), exclusive choice: - cd_deploy = Transition(label=Containerized Deployment) - md_deploy = Transition(label=Monolithic Deployment) choice_node = OperatorPOWL(operator=Operator.XOR, children=[cd_deploy, md_deploy]) Then QA and SA: qa_test = Transition(label=Quality Assurance Tests) sa_audit  = Transition(label=Security Audit) They are concurrent but both before GLA. So we can have partial order edges from qa_test -> gla and sa_audit -> gla; no edge between qa_test and sa_audit. gla_approval=Transition(label=Go-Live Approval)"

    "Text": "Now root POWl includes all nodes? We could create a root StrictPartialOrder with all nodes as children; then add edges accordingly: Edges: sr_verify -> cs_setup cs_setup -> da_alloc cs_setup -> aci_init da_alloc -> loop_node aci_init -> loop_node loop_node -> choice_node choice_node -> qa_test choice_node -> sa_audit qa_test -> gla_approval sa_audit  -> gla_approval Also maybe we want to ensure that after contract setup both DA and ACI start concurrently; that's fine because no edge between them. Also ensure that after contract setup they must finish before entering loop node; so edges from each to loop node ensures that. Also ensure that after the exclusive choice is done (either cd or md) then QA/SA start concurrently; so edges from choice node to qa_test & sa_audit ensures they wait for deployment completion."

    "Text": "Now about silent transitions: not needed unless grouping tasks into submodels like parallel or loop etc. But the operator nodes already represent loops/choices. The partial order is defined at root level among these operator nodes too? Wait the operator node itself is a POWL model containing its children; but when used as a child of another POWl it acts as a single node in the parent ordering graph. So our root will have these operator nodes as children along with other transitions."

Then build root_po=StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[sr_verify,...]) Add edges using .order.add_edge(source,target). Need to import .order property maybe it's an attribute order which is a networkx DiGraph? In example they used .order.add_edge(loop,xor). So yes use same pattern."

    "Text": "Let's produce final code block with proper formatting per guidelines: Prettier print width 80 characters - okay typical Python formatting within 80 char lines should be fine if not too long lines >80 char maybe break lines manually or rely on Prettier's formatting automatically when executed by user environment - but we just provide code block plain text; it's okay if some lines exceed 80 char though they'd be formatted by Prettier later by user environment presumably. But better keep under 80 char manually where possible. We'll produce final answer with explanation maybe minimal comments inside code for clarity but not required though helpful. Provide final python snippet only inside markdown triple backticks python block preceded by explanation text? The prompt says The LLM should produce Python code using .... It doesn't explicitly ask for explanation outside code block but may include some comments inside code block for clarity which is fine because still part of python file content not output commentary outside of it except maybe preceding description line Here is the Python code: then block. That would satisfy requirement while still providing context outside of block which might be considered part of answer text rather than output content? The instruction says The LLM should produce Python code .... It didn't forbid additional explanatory text outside the block though typical style includes some description preceding the snippet like Here is how you can construct... It's acceptable I think because it's still part of answer content not interfering with requirement about producing python code using those imports etc., which will be satisfied within snippet anyway. Thus I'll provide explanation plus snippet inside markdown triple backticks python format including imports at top etc., constructing all objects and adding edges accordingly following described scenario exactly including comments referencing steps perhaps helpful for readability but still valid python syntax comment lines starting # are fine within snippet—they don't affect semantics nor violate any rule about LaTeX or math expressions—they're just comments so okay. Make sure no inline math expressions needed here except maybe none else - there are none requiring LaTeX usage because no math formulas present in this scenario description aside from names like BNC etc., those are labels strings not math expressions requiring LaTeX formatting per rules—they don't require parentheses around them since they're strings in quotes—so safe. Thus final answer will include explanation + snippet inside markdown triple backticks python showing full construction following scenario steps exactly as described above including appropriate ordering constraints via .order.add_edge calls on root POWl object named root. Let's craft final answer now."
