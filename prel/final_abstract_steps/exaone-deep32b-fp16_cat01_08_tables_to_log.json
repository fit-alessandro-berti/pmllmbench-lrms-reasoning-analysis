The carrier IDs (CR-01, etc.) are in the Resources table as Carrier. So CR-01 is GlobalTransport. So for the dispatch event, the Resource could be the carriers name (GlobalTransport)? That could work... Similarly, the arrival events resource might not be applicable, but perhaps the same carrier? Or maybe the customer.
