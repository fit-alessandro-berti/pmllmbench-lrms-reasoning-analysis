Then, event 4 shows a jump in temperature to 50C, vibration increases to 30 Hz, tool position is 5 mm, and energy goes up to 2.00 kWh. This seems like a significant change."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Another thing to consider: material flow. During cutting (events 4-6), material flow is 5 units/s. During assembling (events 7-8), it's 2 units/s. During welding (event 9), it's 0 again.

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "But I need to make sure that each group is consistent. Let me check each group again. Idle/Setup: All events have low readings. This is the machine not performing any activity. So that's straightforward. Cutting: Events 4-6: temperature increases, vibration increases, energy increases, tool position moves, flow is 5. This is likely cutting, as the tool is engaged, causing heat and vibration. Assembling: Events 7-8: temperature is moderate, vibration is 10 Hz, tool position is 15 mm, material flow is 2 units/s. This suggests that the machine is assembling parts. Welding: Event 9: temperature is very high (80C), vibration is 50 Hz, tool position is 15, energy is 5.00 kWh, flow 0. This high heat and vibration could indicate welding. Cooling: Event 10: temperature drops to 30C, vibration is low, tool position 15. This is likely the machine cooling down after welding. Positioning: Events 11-12: tool position is 20 mm, energy slightly up, flow 1. This might be the machine moving the tool or part."
