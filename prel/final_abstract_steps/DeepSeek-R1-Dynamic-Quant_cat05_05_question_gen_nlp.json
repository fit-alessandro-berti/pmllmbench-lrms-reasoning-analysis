    "Text": "First, there's R&D designing new models. Then sourcing components from multiple countries: Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Germany, and the US. Each supplier has their own lead times and quality metrics. Then assembly in Malaysia with 24/7 operations, quality checks, etc. Transportation via air and sea to distribution centers. Logistics partners handle customs, insurance, regulations. Different strategies for high-demand vs slow markets: just-in-time versus monthly shipments."

    "Text": "Distribution centers send products to retailers, e-commerce, sometimes direct to consumers. Supply chain planners track inventory, sales forecasts, adjust orders. Also quality assurance, compliance with environmental and labor laws, warranty, recalls, continuous improvement. The network involves multiple currencies, time zones, regulations. Digital systems handle purchase orders, invoices, customs, production scheduling, demand planning. Data analytics and ML for predictive insights."
