    "Text": "Lets break down the events per each case 1 Retrieve raw material This is the starting point for each case where the operator gets the metal sheet Likely a Material Preparation step 2 Scanning barcode Once placed on the table scanning the barcode feels like part of identifying the correct part still under material prep 3 Place on table Physical placement here likely transitions the material to the work area still part of preparing for manufacturing 4 Align with robot After placement aligning with the robot arms position This might be part of setup before manufacturing starts 5 Preheat the material Not changing material parts so this remains in material prep After that events shift to welding The operator picks up a welding tool performs welds on corners This seems like the actual manufacturing step Then quality inspections measuring integrity with a sensor coating application drying and a visual check Each of these is a distinct phase"
