If there's a conflict (like different resource_id), we might need to decide which one to take or note both. But the problem says to include all attributes, so maybe list both. 4.

Alternatively, include both timestamps.

Wait the context says Log A's timestamps may reflect the time events are received, not when they started. So maybe the primary log's timestamps are more accurate for ordering.
