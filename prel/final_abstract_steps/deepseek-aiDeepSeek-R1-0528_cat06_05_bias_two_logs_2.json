Their cultural fit scores remain unadjusted throughout the process. For example: - P001 got hired with scores 85/70/65 - P002 rejected with 78/75/60 - P003 hired with 82/68/65"

Candidates U001 and U003 both belong to LocalBusinessLeadersClub and received a +5 Association Boost to their cultural fit scores. This adjustment directly impacted outcomes: - U001s cultural fit jumped from 60 to 65, leading to hiring despite lower skill score than P002 who was rejected - U003 got hired with 75/65/63 after boost, while P002 (78/75/60) wasnt"

    "Text": "The bias manifests through discretionary adjustments that favor certain applicants. Since the boost only applies to one professional group (which Group A candidates dont have access to), it creates systemic advantage. This violates equity principles by: - Making cultural fit assessment non-transparent - Allowing non-merit factors to influence decisions - Creating different passing thresholds for different groups"
