    "Text": "Case 3 Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close After Check inventory if they proceed to Cancel which implies insufficient inventory they shouldnt have Authorize payment or Ship order But here after Check they did Authorize and then Cancel then Ship Thats problematic Because once you Cancel due to insufficient inventory you shouldnt do Ship Also if inventory was sufficient enough to proceed to Authorize payment then why Cancel Maybe an ambiguity here perhaps the inventory check was sufficient but they canceled anyway But according to the process description if inventory is insufficient you go to Cancel directly after Check So in this case after Check they did Authorize which should only happen if inventory is sufficient then Cancel which would be for insufficient Contradiction here Also Shipping after Cancel is a violation"
