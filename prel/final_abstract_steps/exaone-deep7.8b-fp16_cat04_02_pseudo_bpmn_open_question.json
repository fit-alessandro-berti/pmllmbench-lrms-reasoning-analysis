For standard, they do validation, parallel checks (credit and inventory), then calculate delivery date. For custom, they do a feasibility analysis, and if feasible, prepare a quotation or send rejection. After that, there's an approval step if needed, then generate an invoice, and finally send a confirmation."

The parallel checks (credit and inventory) might be a point where delays occur if they take time. Also, the approval step could be a bottleneck if it's manual. Maybe some steps can be automated more."
