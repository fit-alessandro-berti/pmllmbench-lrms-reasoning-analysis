Steps and their corresponding transitions (with labels as given): - Claim Registration (CR) - Document Verification (DV) - Fraud Check (FC) - Claim Assessment (CA) - Approval (AP) [conditional: only if the amount is above threshold] - Payment (P) - Notification (N) - Closure (CL) Additionally, we have two loops: - After Document Verification (DV), if documents are incomplete, we have Re-Document Submission (RDS) and then go back to DV. - After Fraud Check (FC), if doubts are raised, we have In-depth Investigation (II) and then go back to FC."

    "Text": "We also note that the Approval (AP) step is conditional. We can model this by having two outcomes from CA: one that requires approval and one that doesnt. However, the problem states: The claim must be approved by a senior manager if the amount surpasses a certain threshold. So we can model two transitions after CA: - one for when the amount is below the threshold (so we skip AP) and - one for when the amount is above (so we go to AP). But note: the problem does not specify two separate activities for below and above threshold. So we can model the conditional routing with a silent transition (or two transitions, one labeled and one silent) and a place that leads to AP or directly to P. However, lets stick to the given activities and model the conditional branching with a silent transition (since the problem does not specify an activity for the case when approval is not needed). Alternatively, we can have: - After CA, we have a silent transition (tau) for the case of no approval needed, and the AP transition for the case of approval needed. But note: the problem says if the amount surpasses a certain threshold then AP is required. So we can model: CA -> place1 -> (AP) -> place2 -> P CA -> place1 -> (tau) -> place2 -> P However, note that the problem does not specify an activity for the non-approval path, so we use a silent transition."

    "Text": "Lets break down the places we need: start (initial place) -> CR -> place_after_CR -> DV -> place_after_DV -> FC -> place_after_FC -> CA -> place_after_CA Now, from place_after_CA, we have two transitions: - AP (if approval is needed) and - a silent transition (skip_approval) if not. Both AP and skip_approval lead to the same place (place_after_approval) which then goes to P. Then: P -> place_after_P -> N -> place_after_N -> CL -> end (final place)"

    "Text": "For the loops: - The loop for DV and RDS: We have after DV a place (place_after_DV) that leads to FC and also to RDS (if documents are incomplete). But note: the problem says if documents are incomplete after Document Verification (DV), a re-submission of documents step occurs (RDS) before the process continues. So we can model: DV -> place_after_DV -> (if incomplete) RDS -> place_after_RDS -> (loop back to) DV But note: the process must also be able to continue from place_after_DV to FC. So we need a choice at place_after_DV. We can model this by having two transitions from place_after_DV: - one silent transition (tau) for the case of complete documents (then go to FC) and - one transition RDS for the case of incomplete. Then RDS leads to a place that goes back to DV. - Similarly, for FC and II: FC -> place_after_FC -> (if doubts) II -> place_after_II -> (loop back to) FC And a silent transition from place_after_FC to CA for the case of no doubts. However, note that the problem says this can happen multiple times, so we are modeling loops."

    "Text": "Lets define the places and transitions: Places (well give them descriptive names): p0: start (initial place) p1: after_CR p2: after_DV (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to RDS and one silent to FC) p3: after_RDS (this place goes back to DV) p4: after_FC (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to II and one silent to CA) p5: after_II (this place goes back to FC) p6: after_CA (this place will have two outgoing arcs: one to AP and one silent to the next step after approval) p7: after_approval (this place is after AP or the silent transition from p6) p8: after_P p9: after_N p10: end (final place) Transitions (with labels, except the silent ones): CR: Claim Registration DV: Document Verification RDS: Re-Document Submission FC: Fraud Check II: In-depth Investigation CA: Claim Assessment AP: Approval skip_approval: None (silent) P: Payment N: Notification CL: Closure We also need two silent transitions for the choices after DV and after FC: skip_RDS: None (silent) - from p2 to p4 (if documents are complete, then go to FC) skip_II: None (silent) - from p4 to p6 (if no doubts, then go to CA) But note: the problem says the process continues after DV to FC, and after FC to CA, unless there is a loop. So we model the loops as optional and the silent transitions as the way to skip the loop. Now, lets code accordingly. Steps in code: 1. Import necessary modules. 2. Create a Petri net. 3. Create places and transitions. 4. Add them to the net. 5. Connect them with arcs. 6. Set initial and final markings. Note: We are using pm4py.objects.petri_net.utils.petri_utils for adding arcs and removing places (if needed) but in this example we dont remove places. Lets code accordingly."
