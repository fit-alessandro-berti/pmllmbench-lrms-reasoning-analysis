Let me verify: Root SEQUENCE receive_order completed check_inventory completes partially fully enough to trigger successful_subtree but in reality, partial is not allowed. So after receiving and checking inventory sufficiently even if only part, xor_node child A successful_subtree starts. Then the parallel activities can proceed: authorize payment might start immediately as soon as sufficient for that item becomes available? But process trees model allows overlapping executions. So this trace would be accepted by the model but is invalid according to domain rules because authorization requires full inventory confirmation before any other step in order processing."
