    "Text": "First lets understand the hiring process as described 1 Resume Parsing Initial Data Check This is an automated system that scans resumes for key qualifications degrees and past work experiences Any missing information triggers a loop process where the applicant is asked to provide additional details before proceeding 2 Preliminary Skill Assessment Applicants take an online skill test assessing domain-specific knowledge The results are scored automatically Applicants below a certain score threshold may be disqualified while those above the threshold proceed 3 Cultural Fit Community Affiliation Check At this stage the company attempts to gauge whether applicants align with the companys stated values However the process is not purely merit-based Applicants who indicate membership in the Global Business Leaders Club or are flagged as local residents receive a slight subjective uplift in their cultural alignment evaluation This step is often an XOR choice in the process either you go through a standard cultural fit assessment or you take a path where community affiliation leads to implicit score adjustments 4 Managerial Review Final Decision A human reviewer hiring manager examines borderline candidates In the presence of implicit affiliations or local-community-based cues reviewers may consciously or unconsciously view these candidates more favorably The final decision is then made either approving the candidate for hire or rejecting them"
