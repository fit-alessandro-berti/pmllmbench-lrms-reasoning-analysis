    "Text": "Potential areas: - Why certain components sourced from specific countries? (Taiwan microprocessors, Japan camera modules, South Korea OLED screens, GermanyUSA sensors memory) -> Consider expertise, cost, quality, risk diversification. - The parallel gateway for securing components: what if some components delayed? How to synchronize? Could there be alternative suppliers? - Shipping components to Malaysia: why Malaysia for assembly? Labor costs, trade agreements, proximity to suppliers? Could be alternative locations. - Assembly 247 operation: implications on labor, equipment maintenance, quality. - Quality checks: what criteria? How to manage reworkscrap? How to minimize defects? - Distribution split: air freight vs cargo ship: decision criteria? Cost vs speed? How to allocate? - Customs clearance: regulatory compliance across many countries; potential delays. - Regional distribution centers: locations and why? - Multiple distribution channels: local warehousing, retailers, ecommerce, direct shipments; how to coordinate? Inventory allocation? - Monitoring inventory sales forecast: methods? How to decide to adjust orders or proceed? - Risk management: disruptions like natural disasters, political instability, pandemics, trade wars, port strikes, etc. - Performance measurement: KPIs like order fulfillment time, inventory turns, defect rates, lead times, cost per unit, on-time delivery, etc. - Stakeholder communication: between RD, suppliers, assembly plant, logistics providers, distributors, retailers, customers. - Sustainability: environmental impact of global shipping, e-waste, energy consumption. - Technology: use of IoT, blockchain, AI for tracking, forecasting, quality. - Process improvements: lean, just-in-time, vendor-managed inventory, etc. - Decision-making: who makes decisions at exclusive gateways? Based on what data? - Demand variability: how to handle sudden spikes or drops? Flexibility in supply chain. - Supplier relationships: long-term contracts vs spot purchases? How to ensure reliability. - Integration of market research with RD and demand forecasting. - The next sales cycle might involve new product iteration; how does feedback loop work? - Potential for local assembly or regional customization. - Regulatory compliance: different standards (FCC, CE, etc.) and certifications. - End-of-life considerations: recycling, returns."
