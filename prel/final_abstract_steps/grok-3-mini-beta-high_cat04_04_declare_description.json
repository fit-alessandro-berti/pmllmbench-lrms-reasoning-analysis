Perhaps I need to interpret it as they cannot occur together in a way, but with support 1.0 confidence 1.0, it means the constraint is that they do not coexist, so in valid traces, if Receive_Application occurs, Transfer_Funds does not, or vice versa. But that contradicts the process. ... In DECLARE, non_coexistence(A,B) means that in no trace do both A and B occur. So if there is a trace where application is approved, both occur, so it violates. Perhaps in this model, all traces have Receive_Application, and some have Transfer_Funds, but the constraint forbids it, so maybe the model is for rejected applications or something, but that's unlikely."
