    "Text": "But the instruction says rename activities that recur within the same case; so we dont need to change non-recurring ones like Submit Additional etc. But we might still adjust some names like Initiate Request stays same across all cases though it appears multiple times across cases but not within a single case repeated? It appears once per case except maybe each case has one instance only. So no need to rename it unless repeated within a single case which isnt happening except possibly if there were multiple initiations per case but not present here. So keep it unchanged. Similarly Approve Request occurs once per case so no change needed unless repeated within a single case which isnt present here either. So only changes needed are for Verify Documents and Call Customer that appear more than once within a single case across all cases combined? Actually they appear multiple times across different cases too, but requirement says identify activities that appear multiple times within the same case and interpret how meaning changes depending on position/context. That includes those repeated events inside each individual case e.g., Verify Documents appears twice in C001 and again twice in C003; similarly Calls appear twice in each of those cases where they occur more than once inside a single Case ID. So yes we will rename them accordingly inside each occurrence based on context/time/role/resource etc., even though they are separate occurrences across different cases—they will have similar patterns though slightly different contexts like branch vs backoffice etc., but naming should reflect general pattern rather than specific resource differences perhaps include resource type if relevant?"

    "Text": "Better approach: Use generic naming capturing role & purpose: For Verify Documents: First instance often initial verification before any other action. Name: Initial Document Verification Or First-Time Identity Check Or Document Validation Second instance often re-check after additional documents provided or account adjustment. Name: Re‑Verification of Documentation Similarly for Calls: First call usually outbound request for missing info/clarification. Name: Outbound Contact – Information Requested Second call usually follow-up confirmation after action taken. Name: Follow‑Up Contact – Confirmation We can incorporate resource type if helpful e.g., BackOfficeAgent vs FrontlineAgent vs BranchOfficer—maybe not necessary because role already captured by activity name plus context indicates who does it anyway via Resource column; still good to keep consistent naming across resources so easier analysis later."

Provide entire revised event log including all rows sorted by Case ID ascending then timestamp ascending presumably already sorted originally; maintain order unchanged aside from renaming fields where applicable. Also provide justification bullet list summarizing naming choices referencing contextual clues such as timestamps relative positions and content of additional context field indicating reason for second verification/call etc.; mention that these renamings disambiguate roles making process clearer e.g., distinguishing between initial document check vs re-check after corrections, distinguishing between outbound contact requesting information vs follow-up confirmation calls etc.; mention that this helps analysts understand process flow better when performing mining tasks such as conformance checking or performance analysis because ambiguous activity names would otherwise merge distinct steps into one concept leading to inaccurate models."
