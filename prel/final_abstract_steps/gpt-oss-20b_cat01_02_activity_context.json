Some appear multiple times: Verify Documents appears twice in C001 and twice in C003; Call Customer appears twice in C002 and twice in C003; also maybe Submit Additional only once. We need to rename activities to reflect context."

    "Text": "So we propose new names: Initiate Request remains same? Could keep same. Verify Documents -> two variants: Initial Document Verification, Re-Verification of Documents. But we might also differentiate by resource type: BackOfficeAgent vs BranchOfficer. But the main difference is context/time. Call Customer -> two variants: Outbound Call for Missing Information, Follow-Up Confirmation Call. Adjust Account remains same but could add Internal Adjustment but its fine. Submit Additional remains same but maybe Customer Uploads Additional ID. Approve Request final approval remains same."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "But the instruction says rename activities that recur within the same case; so we dont need to change non-recurring ones like Submit Additional etc. But we might still adjust some names like Initiate Request stays same across all cases though it appears multiple times across cases but not within a single case repeated? It appears once per case except maybe each case has one instance only. So no need to rename it unless repeated within a single case which isnt happening except possibly if there were multiple initiations per case but not present here. So keep it unchanged."

    "Text": "Better approach: Use generic naming capturing role & purpose: For Verify Documents: First instance often initial verification before any other action. Name: Initial Document Verification. Or First-Time Identity Check. Or Document Validation. Second instance often re-check after additional documents provided or account adjustment. Name: ReVerification of Documentation. Similarly for Calls: First call usually outbound request for missing info/clarification. Name: Outbound Contact Information Requested. Second call usually follow-up confirmation after action taken. Name: FollowUp Contact Confirmation"

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "We can incorporate resource type if helpful e.g., BackOfficeAgent vs FrontlineAgent vs BranchOfficer maybe not necessary because role already captured by activity name plus context indicates who does it anyway via Resource column; still good to keep consistent naming across resources so easier analysis later."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also provide justification bullet list summarizing naming choices referencing contextual clues such as timestamps relative positions and content of additional context field indicating reason for second verification/call etc.; mention that these renamings disambiguate roles making process clearer e.g., distinguishing between initial document check vs re-check after corrections, distinguishing between outbound contact requesting information vs follow-up confirmation calls etc.; mention that this helps analysts understand process flow better when performing mining tasks such as conformance checking or performance analysis because ambiguous activity names would otherwise merge distinct steps into one concept leading to inaccurate models."
