The timestamps here are precise, but maybe System B's logs have some differences. Log B has more attributes like user_id, resource_id, notes, and different event names but similar order IDs. The timestamps in Log B might be slightly offset. The task is to align events based on order ID and timing, merging where possible."

So events with the same order_id and timestamps (within the tolerance) should be merged. However, if an event has the same order_id but a timestamp that's too far off (like more than 2 seconds), they can't be merged."

The difference between 09:59:58 and 10:00 is 2 seconds. Since the tolerance is less than 2 seconds, perhaps they can be merged? Wait, the problem says if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds, consider them same. So 09:59:58 vs 10:00:00 is exactly 2 seconds. Since it's not less than 2, they would not be merged."

The user wrote: small timestamp tolerance for matching (e.g., if timestamps differ by less than 2 seconds). So in this case, the difference is exactly 2 seconds. So not within the tolerance. Therefore, the OrderReceived in Log B would not be merged with Log A's event."
