Wait, but the problem says if two events appear to represent the same occurrence, merge them into a single record. So perhaps the key is to match events that are part of the same order's timeline. For example, the Order Received in Log B at 09:59 and Log A's Order Received at 10:00 could be merged if they are considered the same event.

The problem allows a small tolerance (like less than 2 seconds?

So in this case, the PaymentCheck in Log B (Order#1234 at 10:02:05) and Log A's Payment Processed at 10:02:00 would be considered the same event.

Hmm, but maybe the problem expects that even if the difference is more than 2 seconds, we can still merge as long as they are in the same order and time. Wait, perhaps the tolerance is the threshold for considering them the same. So if the difference is under 2 seconds, they are merged. Otherwise, they are considered separate events.
