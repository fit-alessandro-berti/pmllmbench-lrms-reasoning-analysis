The Finalize Doc after rejection suggests a procedural oversight or a misunderstanding of the Rejected status.    *   Case 3: Why the delays? Weekends?        *   Case 3 timeline: Jan 12 Friday 09:00 -> Jan 14 Sunday 10:00?        *   Interpretation: If the credit check happened on a Sunday, this implies an automated system or weekend work, but the 24h window might have been interpreted as business hours."
