    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "What about the existence of C The existence rule for C says that every claim must have a C event Which is correct because the process ends with C But combined with the noncoexistence of E and C that would require that if a claim has C it cannot have E But since every claim must have C from existence then no claim can have E But the intended process includes E as a step So thats a major contradiction Because if existence of C requires that C is present and noncoexistence of E and C requires that if C is present E cannot be then E can never exist in any claim But the process requires E to happen before C So this is a critical anomaly"
