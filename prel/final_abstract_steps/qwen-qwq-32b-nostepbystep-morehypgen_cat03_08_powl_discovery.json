Hmm, so the AS loop (LOOP(AS, IQC)) allows exiting after the first AS, which is why in case4 it didn't loop. That makes sense because the loop allows exiting after the first A (AS), so if the condition to exit is met, it can proceed without doing B (IQC). Thus, the loop allows for 0 or more repetitions. Wait, the loop operator's definition says: execute A (AS), then either exit, or do B (IQC) then A again. Wait, the loop allows to execute A once (AS), then decide to exit.
