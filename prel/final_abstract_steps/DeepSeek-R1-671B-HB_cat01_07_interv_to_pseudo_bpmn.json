    "Text": "Starting with Interview 1 (Mary, Accounts Payable Clerk). She mentions the process starts with receiving an invoice via email. The first step is checking for a valid PO number. If no PO, send back to supplier. If there's a PO, log it into the system. Then forward to Purchasing (Dan) to confirm goods received. Once confirmed, match invoice to PO. If discrepancies, email Purchasing. If unresolved, escalate to supervisor (Rita). Once resolved and manager (Carlos) approves, schedule payment."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Interview 2 (Dan, Purchasing Officer). When he gets the invoice from AP, he checks details against PO. If discrepancies, contact supplier or ask AP to hold. If correct, send confirmation. Also mentions if PO missing, tells Mary to get PO info."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Interview 3 (Carlos, Department Manager). He gets notification after PO confirmation and matching. Approves if all good, else reject or ask for investigation. Then sends back to AP for payment."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Interview 4 (Rita, AP Supervisor). She handles exceptions when Mary can't resolve. Contacts suppliers, coordinates departments. For invoices without PO, works on retrospective PO or rejection. Then resumes normal flow."

  {
    "Name": "Abductive Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Potential conflicts or ambiguities: Who exactly contacts the supplier when there's a discrepancy? Mary (AP Clerk) mentions emailing Purchasing team, Dan (Purchasing) says they contact supplier directly or ask AP to hold. So maybe two paths: sometimes Purchasing contacts supplier, sometimes AP holds."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Also, Rita mentions handling cases without PO by creating retrospective PO or rejecting. So that's an alternate path when there's no PO but Rita intervenes. Karen is involved in discrepancies, but it's not clear if she's automatically involved or only in certain cases. The model should capture that she's looped in when needed."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Also, after Manager approval, Carlos thinks it goes back to AP, which matches Mary's account of scheduling payment. Rita's involvement is only in exceptions. So the main flow is linear with possible loops for exceptions."

  {
    "Name": "Inductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now compiling all this into a structured textual model. The main flow seems to be: Start -> Receive Invoice -> Check PO? If no PO, return to supplier. If PO exists, log invoice, send to Purchasing. Purchasing confirms receipt and checks details. If discrepancies, contact supplier or hold. If resolved, proceed to match invoice to PO. If match, send to manager approval. If approved, schedule payment. If not approved, investigate. Exceptions along the way escalate to Rita and Karen as needed."
