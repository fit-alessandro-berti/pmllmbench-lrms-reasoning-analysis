Data Transformation: Convert the raw log into a structured event log format 2. Case Identification: Group related events into coherent cases representing logical work units 3. Activity Naming: Translate low-level actions into meaningful process steps 4. Event Attributes: Include Case ID, Activity Name, Timestamp, and potentially other attributes 5. Coherent Narrative: The log should tell a story of user work sessions 6. Explanation: Provide logic behind case grouping and activity naming"

    "Text": "I see potential connections between different work sessions. The budget work appears directly linked to Document1.docx, with explicit cross-referencing. The quarterly report might be a larger, overarching project that connects multiple document interactions. Ill need to carefully trace these interconnections to create meaningful case groupings that reflect the actual workflow and project relationships. The key is identifying the core narrative thread - likely a quarterly report preparation process that involves multiple document types and cross-referencing. Ill structure the cases to capture this integrated work approach, ensuring each case represents a distinct but connected phase of the overall project."

    "Text": "1. Ill structure the work processes into cohesive case groups that capture the interconnected nature of document preparation and project management. 2. The cases will reflect distinct work streams: document drafting, email communication, financial review, and report synthesis. Each case represents a focused work session with clear start and end points. 3. By clustering related activities, I can trace the logical progression of work across different applications and document types, revealing the underlying workflow and decision-making processes. 4. The approach emphasizes grouping actions that share a common objective, providing a comprehensive view of how tasks interconnect and progress."
