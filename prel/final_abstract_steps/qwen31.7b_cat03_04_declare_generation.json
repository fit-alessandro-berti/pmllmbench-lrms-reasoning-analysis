The first four keys have values that are dictionaries with activities and their support and confidence. The other keys (responded_existence, coexistence, response, precedence, succession, etc.) also have similar structures."

So, the 'init' key's value would be a dictionary where the key is the activity (like 'IG') and the value is a tuple (support, confidence).

But maybe the 'init' key is for the initial activity, and the 'existence' key is for the presence of the initial activity. Wait, but the problem states that for the keys {'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init'}, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule."

From the problem statement: For the keys {'existence', 'absence', 'exactly_one', 'init'}, the value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence of the declarative rule.

But the other keys (responded_existence, coexistence, response, precedence, succession, etc.) would each have their own activities and support/confidence. But since the problem doesn't specify the exact values, we can assume that the support is 1.0 and confidence is 1.0 for all."
