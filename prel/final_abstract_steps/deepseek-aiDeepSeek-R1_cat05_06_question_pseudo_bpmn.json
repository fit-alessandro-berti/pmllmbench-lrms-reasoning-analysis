    "Text": "Need to ensure each question is distinct and covers different parts of the process. Maybe 3-4 questions per category. Lets brainstorm: 1. Rationale for choosing specific countries for components. (Taiwan, Japan, etc.) 2. Why assemble in Malaysia? Labor costs, location, infrastructure? 3. Why use 24/7 assembly? Benefits vs. risks. 4. How are suppliers selected for components? Criteria? 5. How is demand variability handled in inventory monitoring? 6. What if a component supplier fails? Alternatives? 7. Contingency plans for shipping delays. 8. How to ensure compliance across regions? 9. How are quality check pass/fail thresholds determined? 10. Decision factors for air vs sea freight. 11. How stakeholder communication is maintained across regions. 12. KPIs for supply chain efficiency. 13. Sustainability considerations in the process. 14. Ethical sourcing of components. 15. How local regulations affect distribution. 16. Technology use in process optimization. 17. Lead time reduction strategies. 18. Handling returns or recalls. 19. Impact of geopolitical issues. 20. Alignment between RD and component suppliers."

    "Text": "Wait, thats 20. Let me check if they cover all areas and are open-ended. Also, avoid yes/no questions. Each should prompt deeper analysis. For example, How does the company ensure compliance with regional regulatory requirements during customs clearance? makes them think about compliance strategies. What criteria determine the allocation of smartphones to air freight versus cargo ship distribution? gets into cost, urgency, demand factors."
