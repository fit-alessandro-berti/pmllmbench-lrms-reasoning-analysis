But we can propose a query that flags cases where the sequence numbers do not form a contiguous block from min(seq) to max(seq).\n\nAdditionally, one may want to see the order of activities per case. We can use window functions: using lead/lag.\n\nFor example:\nWITH ordered_events as (...)\nSELECT *\nFROM ordered_events\nWHERE (prev_activity IS NOT NULL AND seq_order < \n       CASE prev_activity...)\n   OR (next_activity IS NOT NULL AND seq_order > \n       CASE next_activity...);\n\nBut that might be complicated. Instead, simpler: Flag cases where the order of events is not strictly ascending based on our mapping ordering. For instance:\nWITH ordered AS (...)\nSELECT *\nFROM ordered\nWHERE (prev_seq IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <> prev_seq + 1)\n   OR (next_seq IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <> next_seq - 1);\nThis query will list events that are out-of-sequence."

For example, for order id 1003, if we expect contiguous steps from 1 to 7, but if some step is missing then count distinct might be lower than max-min+1. But note: In case 1002, events are not necessarily contiguous because they come out-of-order? Wait, let's check:\nFor case_id 1002, what are the event seq orders we get?\n... Distinct set is {1,4,5,2,3,6,7}. The minimum is 1, maximum is 7. Count distinct = 7. Then max-min+1 = 7. So this method would not catch that because even if they are out-of-order, the set of distinct values covers all numbers from 1 to 7.\nSo we need to check ordering by event_id order."

But in our data, some anomalies exist: For example, event \"Ship Goods\" for case 1003 was performed by WarehouseClerk_3 who belongs to department Logistics? Actually check resource table:\n... So all shipping events should be done by either a warehouse clerk or logistics manager. In the provided log:\nFor event 1003, Ship Goods is performed by WarehouseClerk_3, which is valid since they are in Logistics? Actually check: For \"Ship Goods\", we expect maybe a Warehouse Clerk? But our mapping says \"Ship Goods\" (Logistics) so department should be Logistics. So that's fine.\nBut then Confirm Shipment for 1003 was performed by LogisticsMgr_2 who is in Logistics, which is acceptable.\n\nFor case_id 1004, the order events are out-of-sequence but resource wise:\n...\nBut the ordering is suspect.
