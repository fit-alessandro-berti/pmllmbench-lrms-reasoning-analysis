According to underlying normal process flow, it should be Register Order, then Credit Check, Validate Stock, Confirm Shipment, Ship Goods, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment. But in id 1003: They did Register, then credit check, but then directly ship goods skipping validation stock and confirm shipment? And later invoice is issued. Also confirmation of shipment occurs after shipping goods; thats out-of-order. Additionally, for case_id 1004, the order flow seems reversed: 21 Register Order at 09:00, then event_id 22 Receive Payment at 09:05 (very early) then issue invoice (09:20) then confirm shipment (09:25) then ship goods (09:50). So that is clearly out-of-sequence. Also note that for case id 1004 the order flow is Register Order then Receive Payment, which doesnt even make sense because payment should happen after shipping and invoicing."

Also, order event log does not follow the normal process flow. - Case 1003: Missing or out-of-sequence events; skipping Validate Stock? And Confirmation of shipment happened after shipping goods and issuing invoice (should come earlier in sequence). - Case 1004: Payment received before even an invoice was issued; also shipment events are out-of-order. Thus anomalies: 1) Out-of-sequence event ordering. In some cases, events appear that contradict the assumed business process flow. 2) Possibly missing required events like validation of stock might be missing in case_id 1003. But actually check: Case 1001: normal Case 1002: Missing Validate Stock? Actually check: 1002 has Confirm Shipment at timestamp (08:25), then credit check, validate stock events come after that? Wait lets re-read 1002 row carefully: For case_id 1002: - Event_id 8: Register Order at 08:20, event_id 9: Confirm Shipment at 08:25, then event_id 10: Ship Goods at 08:40, then event_id 11: Perform Credit Check at 09:10, then event_id 12: Validate Stock at 09:15, then event_id 13: Issue Invoice at 09:30, then event_id 14: Receive Payment at 2024-02-02 10:00. So missing initial credit check? Actually not missing; they have Perform Credit Check but it comes after the shipment events. And also Validate Stock should normally occur before shipment events typically. So process order seems wrong. For case_id 1003: We have: Register Order, then credit check, then ship goods without validating stock or confirming shipment, and then issue invoice, then confirm shipment. In a standard process, we expect validate stock event between credit check and shipment. But its missing from the log. So anomaly is that Validate Stock is missing. For case_id 1004: We have: Register Order at 09:00, then Receive Payment (at 09:05) which normally would come last; then Issue Invoice at 09:20, then Confirm Shipment at 09:25, then Ship Goods at 09:50. This order is clearly anomalous. Thus anomalies: - Out-of-sequence events. - Missing expected events (e.g., Validate Stock for case_id 1003). - Payment received prior to invoice issuance and shipment confirmation in case id 1004."

It may be due to system errors where the event log is not correctly timestamped or events are recorded asynchronously, leading to out-of-order logging; it could also be human error in entering the logs manually, or even malicious tampering. Specifically: - For case 1002 and 1003, credit check and validate stock are performed after shipment. This may indicate system issues (like delay in recording certain events) or process bypass where some checks are done offline. - In the case of 1004, receiving payment before invoice issuance might be due to manual override or prepayment scenario, but its clearly an anomaly given the standard order flow."

The queries should probably check ordering issues: e.g., if events are out-of-order compared to expected process flow.

We might use a query that groups by case_id and then uses window functions (like ROW_NUMBER, LAG) to compare activity sequences. For example, if we assume that Register Order should come first, then Perform Credit Check, etc. One idea: Create a list of activities and check for anomalies: SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, timestamp, LAG(activity,1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as previous_activity FROM order_event_log; But we can propose query that identifies orders where there is an event out-of-sequence relative to a predefined ordering.

Confirm Shipment (Logistics) 5. Ship Goods (Logistics) 6. Issue Invoice (Finance) 7. Receive Payment (Finance) We can define a mapping table or CASE statement with an ordering: For each event, assign a numeric order value: - Register Order -> 1 - Perform Credit Check -> 2 - Validate Stock -> 3 - Confirm Shipment -> 4 - Ship Goods -> 5 - Issue Invoice -> 6 - Receive Payment -> 7 Then, for each event in order_event_log we can check if the events are sorted by that assigned order value. For a given case id, if min(order_value) is not equal to first events sequence number and last events sequence number is not equal to expected? Alternatively, we can compute the difference between the maximum and minimum event ordering for each case id then check if it matches count of events. But note that some orders may be missing steps. We need to query anomalies: cases where the order does not include all expected steps in correct order. For example, order id 1003 is missing Validate Stock and has out-of-order sequence.

For example: WITH ordered_events as (  SELECT    case_id,    event_id,    activity,    timestamp,    LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) AS prev_activity,    LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) AS next_activity,    CASE activity      WHEN Register Order THEN 1      WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2      WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3      WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4      WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5      WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6      WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7      ELSE NULL END AS seq_order  FROM order_event_log ) SELECT * FROM ordered_events WHERE (prev_activity IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <        CASE prev_activity          WHEN Register Order THEN 1          WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2          WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3          WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4          WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5          WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6          WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7          ELSE NULL END)    OR (next_activity IS NOT NULL AND seq_order >        CASE next_activity          WHEN Register Order THEN 1          WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2          WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3          WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4          WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5          WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6          WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7          ELSE NULL END); But that might be complicated. Instead, simpler: Flag cases where the order of events is not strictly ascending based on our mapping ordering.

Lets do: Actually check sequence differences. We can compare seq_order with the seq_order of previous event: SELECT case_id, event_id, activity, seq_order,       LAG(seq_order) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as prev_seq FROM (   SELECT ... same sub query ... ) t WHERE (prev_seq IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <> prev_seq + 1) OR (next event not equal to seq_order+1). But note, its possible that not all events are present in a given order. But if they are out-of-order then difference wont be exactly one. So: WITH ordered AS ( SELECT case_id,        activity,        event_id,        CASE activity           WHEN Register Order THEN 1           WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2           WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3           WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4           WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5           WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6           WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7           ELSE NULL END AS seq_order,        LAG(seq_order) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as prev_seq,        LEAD(seq_order) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY event_id) as next_seq  FROM order_event_log ) SELECT * FROM ordered WHERE (prev_seq IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <> prev_seq + 1)    OR (next_seq IS NOT NULL AND seq_order <> next_seq - 1); This query will list events that are out-of-sequence.  We can then filter by case_id to see anomalies. Alternatively, we might want to aggregate per order and check if the sequence is contiguous: WITH event_summary AS ( SELECT case_id,        MIN(seq_order) as min_seq,        MAX(seq_order) as max_seq,        COUNT(DISTINCT seq_order) as distinct_count  FROM (   SELECT case_id,          CASE activity             WHEN Register Order THEN 1             WHEN Perform Credit Check THEN 2             WHEN Validate Stock THEN 3             WHEN Confirm Shipment THEN 4             WHEN Ship Goods THEN 5             WHEN Issue Invoice THEN 6             WHEN Receive Payment THEN 7             ELSE NULL END as seq_order   FROM order_event_log  ) sub  GROUP BY case_id ) SELECT * FROM event_summary WHERE distinct_count <> (max_seq - min_seq + 1); That query will return orders that have a gap in the sequence numbers. For example, for order id 1003, if we expect contiguous steps from 1 to 7, but if some step is missing then count distinct might be lower than max-min+1. But note: In case 1002, events are not necessarily contiguous because they come out-of-order? Wait, lets check: For case_id 1002, what are the event seq orders we get? Event id 8: Register Order => seq_order=1 Event id 9: Confirm Shipment => seq_order=4 (should be after validate stock but appears second). Event id 10: Ship Goods => seq_order=5. Event id 11: Perform Credit Check => seq_order=2. Event id 12: Validate Stock => seq_order=3. Event id 13: Issue Invoice => seq_order=6. Event id 14: Receive Payment => seq_order=7. Distinct set is {1,4,5,2,3,6,7}. The minimum is 1, maximum is 7. Count distinct = 7. Then max-min+1 = 7. So this method would not catch that because even if they are out-of-order, the set of distinct values covers all numbers from 1 to 7. So we need to check ordering by event_id order."

For instance, we can check if the resource performing a particular step is from an unexpected department. For example: SELECT case_id, activity, resource, timestamp, department, CASE   WHEN activity = Register Order AND department <> Sales THEN Anomaly  WHEN activity IN (Perform Credit Check, Issue Invoice, Receive Payment) AND department <> Finance THEN Anomaly  WHEN activity IN (Validate Stock, Ship Goods) AND department <> Logistics THEN Anomaly  ELSE OK END as anomaly_flag FROM order_event_log e JOIN resources r on e.resource = r.resource_id; This can help to check if the events are handled by resources from expected departments. But in our data, some anomalies exist: For example, event Ship Goods for case 1003 was performed by WarehouseClerk_3 who belongs to department Logistics? Actually check resource table: - WarehouseClerk_3 is in department Logistics? Wait, checking provided sample rows in resources, we have: SalesRep_01 Sales Executive Sales, SalesRep_02 Sales Executive Sales, SalesRep_03 Sales Executive Sales, CreditOfficer_1: Credit Analyst Finance, CreditOfficer_2: Credit Analyst Finance, FinanceTeam_01: Accountant Finance, FinanceTeam_02: Cashier Finance, FinanceTeam_03: Billing Officer Finance, WarehouseClerk_1: Warehouse Staff Logistics, WarehouseClerk_2: Warehouse Staff Logistics, WarehouseClerk_3: Warehouse Staff Logistics, WarehouseClerk_4: Warehouse Staff Logistics, LogisticsMgr_1: Logistics Manager Logistics, LogisticsMgr_2: Logistics Manager Logistics. So all shipping events should be done by either a warehouse clerk or logistics manager. In the provided log: For event 1003, Ship Goods is performed by WarehouseClerk_3, which is valid since they are in Logistics? Actually check: For Ship Goods, we expect maybe a Warehouse Clerk? But our mapping says Ship Goods (Logistics) so department should be Logistics. So thats fine. But then Confirm Shipment for 1003 was performed by LogisticsMgr_2 who is in Logistics, which is acceptable. For case_id 1004, the order events are out-of-sequence but resource wise: - event Register Order: SalesRep_01 from sales, ok. - event Receive Payment: performed by FinanceTeam_02 which is cashier, fine. - event Issue Invoice: FinanceTeam_01 (Accountant), fine. - event Confirm Shipment: LogisticsMgr_1 who is logistics manager, but order flow expected that earlier in sequence. - event Ship Goods: WarehouseClerk_4, which is ok. But the ordering is suspect. So query on resource and process may not catch the anomaly of out-of-sequence events; instead we need to check timestamp order relative to expected workflow steps. Also anomalies: Payment received before invoice issued in case 1004. We can check that by comparing timestamps for Receive Payment and Issue Invoice. So query: SELECT o.case_id, e_invoice.timestamp as invoice_time, e_payment.timestamp as payment_time FROM orders o JOIN order_event_log e_invoice on o.case_id = e_invoice.case_id AND e_invoice.activity = Issue Invoice JOIN order_event_log e_payment on o.case_id = e_payment.case_id AND e_payment.activity = Receive Payment WHERE e_payment.timestamp < e_invoice.timestamp; That will highlight anomalies. Similarly, we can check if credit checks and stock validations happen before shipping. For that, query: SELECT case_id FROM orders JOIN order_event_log e_ship on orders.case_id = e_ship.case_id AND e_ship.activity = Ship Goods LEFT JOIN order_event_log e_credit on orders.case_id = e_credit.case_id AND e_credit.activity = Perform Credit Check WHERE e_credit.timestamp IS NULL OR e_credit.timestamp > e_ship.timestamp; This query finds cases where credit check is missing or occurs after shipping. Also, we might want to identify if any events are recorded by a resource that does not belong to the expected department for that activity: SELECT case_id, activity, resource, timestamp, r.department FROM order_event_log e JOIN resources r on e.resource = r.resource_id; But then you need to check if their department matches expectation.

Thus, I will now produce a final answer that identifies anomalies and undesirable behaviors along with SQL queries as above.  Ill also include commentary regarding hypotheses for these anomalies: For example, if Confirm Shipment occurs before Credit Check or Validate Stock, then it might be due to system misconfiguration where events are not recorded in the correct order or perhaps certain steps are done offline."
