But in Petri nets, transitions are unconditional... Since Petri nets don't handle conditions, maybe the process must allow both paths... Maybe the Petri net is designed such that when the process reaches the CA step, there are two possible paths: one leading to AP then P, and another leading directly to P... Let me think the user is expected to model it as a choice here. So after CA, there's a split where the token can go through AP or not."

But the RDS transition then loops back to the place before DV... Alternatively, the RDS transition's output place connects back to the input of DV... Wait, perhaps: Place2 (after DV) has two transitions: RDS and FC... The RDS transition is triggered when documents are incomplete.

Revised AP handling: The choice happens at p4. One path goes to AP, the other path bypasses AP. Both paths must eventually lead to P... The convergence happens at P: P can be enabled by p4 (skip AP) or p5 (after AP). The output of P is always p6. So, arcs are p4->AP, AP->p5, p5->P, p4->P, P->p6."
