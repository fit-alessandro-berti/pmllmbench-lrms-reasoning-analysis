    "Text": "Case 3 Sequence Receive Check Authorize Cancel Ship Close Hmm Lets see After Check inventory they Authorize payment But then they immediately Cancel the order But according to the normative process if inventory is sufficient since they did Check and didnt cancel yet the next step after Authorize should be Package then Ship then Close But here after Authorizing they Cancel Thats a problem Because once you authorize payment you cant just cancel the order Also after Cancel they proceed to Ship and Close which is invalid The correct path after Check would be either Authorize Package Ship Close or if inventory is insufficient Check Cancel Close But in this case since they did Authorize which implies inventory was sufficient they shouldnt cancel Alternatively maybe they checked inventory but found insufficient stock but the process allowed them to proceed to Authorize payment anyway Wait maybe the Check inventory here found insufficient stock but the process allowed them to proceed to Authorize payment anyway Wait the normative says that if inventory is insufficient you must Cancel after Check and then Close So if they Authorize payment after Check that would be a violation because the Check must have found insufficient inventory leading to Cancel not Authorize Alternatively maybe the Check found sufficient but they still canceled Thats also a problem Let me parse this again"

    "Text": "In the normative process after Check inventory two paths 1 Sufficient Authorize Package Ship Close 2 Insufficient Cancel Close So in Case 3 after Check they Authorize payment That would only be allowed if inventory was sufficient But then they proceed to Cancel which is not allowed Because once you authorize payment meaning inventory was sufficient you cant cancel The Cancel should only happen if inventory was insufficient Alternatively maybe they checked inventory found sufficient but then decided to cancel anyway Thats a business logic error Also after Cancel they proceed to Ship and Close which is invalid The Cancel path must end with Close immediately after Cancel So in this case after Cancel they should go to Close but here they have Ship after Cancel which is a violation So multiple issues here Authorizing payment followed by Cancel which is only for insufficient inventory and then proceeding to Ship after Cancel So this case is definitely violating several steps"
