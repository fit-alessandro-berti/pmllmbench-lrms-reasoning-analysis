There's a normative process description for handling orders, and then there's an event log with several cases, each representing a process instance with a sequence of activities and timestamps.

It says that the process always starts with \"Receive order.\" After that, the next step is \"Check inventory\" to see if there's enough stock to fulfill the order. This check must happen before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment are made. If the inventory is found to be sufficient, then the normal progression should continue as follows: after confirming inventory, the process should include the authorization of payment, ensuring that the customer’s payment method is valid and approved. Once the payment is authorized, the items should be prepared for shipment—this is commonly referred to as \"Package items.\" Only after items have been properly packaged is it appropriate to proceed with \"Ship order.\" Once the order has been shipped, it should then be properly finalized by the \"Close order\" activity. This entire sequence—Receive, Check, Authorize Payment, Package, Ship, Close—reflects the expected flow when inventory is not a limiting factor."

This violates the expected flow where payment authorization should precede packaging.\nFor Case 3:\n\nViolation: \"Ship order\" occurs after \"Cancel order.\"\nExplanation: The normative description states that once an order is canceled, it should not proceed with fulfillment activities like shipping. In this case, after \"Cancel order,\" the process still includes \"Ship order,\" which is illogical and violates the process constraints.\nAdditionally, although not as clear, the fact that \"Authorize payment\" occurs before \"Cancel order\" might also be questionable, but since the primary violation is shipping after cancellation, I'll focus on that.\n\nFor Case 5:\n\nViolation: \"Ship order\" occurs without prior \"Package items.\"\nExplanation: The normative process requires that \"Package items\" must occur after \"Authorize payment\" and before \"Ship order.\" In this case, the sequence jumps from \"Authorize payment\" directly to \"Ship order,\" skipping the packaging step.
