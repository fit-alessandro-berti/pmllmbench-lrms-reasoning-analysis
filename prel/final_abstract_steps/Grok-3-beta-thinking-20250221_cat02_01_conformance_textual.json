    "Text": "First, I need to understand the normative process description thoroughly. It says that the process always starts with 'Receive order.' After that, the next step is 'Check inventory' to see if there's enough stock to fulfill the order. This check must happen before any decisions about payment authorization or fulfillment. If the inventory is sufficient, the process should proceed with 'Authorize payment' to ensure the customer's payment method is valid. After that, 'Package items' should happen, followed by 'Ship order,' and finally 'Close order.' ... Check inventory → Cancel order → Close order, for insufficient inventory scenarios."

    "Text": "If the inventory is found to be insufficient, the process must branch to 'Cancel order' after checking the inventory, and then proceed to 'Close order.' ... Any deviation from these principles—such as shipping after cancellation, authorizing payment before checking inventory, or packaging items before authorization—would be considered a violation of the normative process."

    "Text": "Let me start with Case 1: This looks like the sequence for when inventory is sufficient: Receive → Check → Authorize → Package → Ship → Close. It seems to follow the normative process correctly. So, Case 1 is probably fine."

    "Text": "Next, Case 2: ... the sequence is Receive → Check → Package → Authorize → Ship → Close. Wait, that's different from the normative sequence. In the normative process, after checking inventory, it should be Authorize payment, then Package items. But in this case, Package items comes before Authorize payment."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - NE",
    "Text": "Let me check the constraints. It says 'Authorize payment' should occur before packaging, and 'Package items' should only occur after authorization. So yes, in this case, packaging is happening before authorization, which is not allowed. So, Case 2 violates the normative process."

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - IND",
    "Text": "Let me see: perhaps there's another issue: since packaging is done before authorization, it might mean that items are being prepared without knowing if the payment is authorized, which could be problematic. But primarily, the sequence is wrong."

    "Text": "Case 3 starts with Receive → Check → Authorize, but then it has Cancel order, followed by Ship order, and then Close order. Wait a minute, after canceling the order, it still ships the order? That doesn't make sense."

    "Text": "According to the normative description, if the inventory is insufficient, it should go to Cancel order and then Close order. There shouldn't be any shipping after cancellation. So, this case definitely violates the normative process. Specifically, shipping after cancellation is not allowed."

    "Text": "Finally, Case 5: Wait, in this case, after authorizing payment, it directly goes to Ship order, skipping Package items. The normative process requires that 'Package items' must occur after 'Authorize payment' and before 'Ship order.' In this case, the sequence jumps from 'Authorize payment' directly to 'Ship order,' skipping the packaging step. This violates the expected sequence where items must be packaged before they can be shipped."
