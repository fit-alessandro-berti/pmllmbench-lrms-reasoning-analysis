Wait, in the diagram, after the Run Parallel Checks Gateway, its an AND leading to Tasks C1 and C2. Wait, in BPMN, an AND gateway is for parallel execution, so maybe thats correct. The XOR at Check Request Type is a decision point choosing between Standard or Custom path. Then after the parallel checks, the Join gateway (which is another XOR or AND?) Wait, the diagram shows All Parallel Checks Completed (Join). In BPMN, a Join is used to synchronize parallel flows, waiting for all branches to complete. So thats correct."

Task B1 is standard validation, maybe basic checks. The parallel checks (Credit and Inventory) are necessary for standard requests. Then Task D calculates delivery date based on those checks. For custom, after feasibility analysis, if feasible, prepare quotation (Task E1), else reject (E2). Then after either path (standard or custom tasks completed), check approval needed (XOR). If yes, obtain manager approval (Task F), then check if approved (XOR). If approved, generate invoice (Task G); if not, re-evaluate (loop back to E1 or D).
