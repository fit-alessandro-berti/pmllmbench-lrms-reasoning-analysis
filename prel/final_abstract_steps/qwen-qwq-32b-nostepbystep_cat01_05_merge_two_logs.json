So then, those two events (10:05:00 vs 10:05:02) would have a 2-second difference, so they can't be merged. However, the event names are similar: \"Item Shipped\" vs \"Shipping\". The time difference is just over, so they can't be matched. Wait, but maybe the event names are close enough? The problem states that event names may differ, so perhaps they are the same event even with a different name. However, the timestamp would be the main factor here.
