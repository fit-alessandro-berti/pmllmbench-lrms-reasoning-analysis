Key constraints: 1. Authorize payment should only occur after Check inventory and before Package items. 2. Package items should only occur after Authorize payment and before Ship order. 3. Ship order should only occur after Package items and never after a cancellation. 4. Close order should be the final activity in all scenarios."

    "Text": "Now, lets analyze each case: Case 1:   Activities:     Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Package items -> Ship order -> Close order   This matches the sufficient inventory path. No violation. Case 2:   Activities:     Receive order -> Check inventory -> Package items -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order   Violation:     Package items occurs before Authorize payment.     According to the normative process: Package items should only occur after authorization.     So, this is a violation of the constraint: Package items should only occur after authorization. Case 3:   Activities:     Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Cancel order -> Ship order -> Close order   Violations:     - After Cancel order, the next activity is Ship order. This is not allowed because after cancellation, we should not ship.       The normative process says: Once an order is canceled, it would be illogical to continue with activities intended for fulfillment (such as packaging or shipping).     - Also, note that Authorize payment was done before Cancel order. However, the normative process says that if inventory is insufficient, we should go directly to Cancel order after checking.       But in this case, they did Authorize payment and then Cancel order. This is also a violation because in the insufficient inventory path, we should not authorize payment at all.   So two violations in case 3:     a) Authorizing payment in an insufficient inventory scenario (which should not happen because we should cancel immediately after check).     b) Shipping after cancellation. Case 4:   Activities:     Receive order -> Check inventory -> Cancel order -> Close order   This matches the insufficient inventory path. No violation. Case 5:   Activities:     Receive order -> Check inventory -> Authorize payment -> Ship order -> Close order   Violation:     Missing Package items.     According to the normative process: after authorizing payment, we should package items before shipping.     The constraint says: Ship order should only occur after packaging.     Therefore, shipping without packaging is a violation."

Case 3:   - Violation 1: Authorizing payment in a scenario that should have been canceled (because after check inventory we should have canceled, but they authorized payment and then canceled).   - Violation 2: Shipping after cancellation. Case 5:   - Violation: Shipping without packaging. Now, we write the answer accordingly."
