Assigning a Property Manager, 4. Introductory Meeting, 5. Property Inspection and Marketing, 6. Activation and Tenant Screening, 7. Lease Finalization and Move-in, 8. Quality Checks and Audits, 9. Communication and Exception Handling, 10. Overall Process."

How are the factors (workload, geography, experience, track record) weighted when assigning a manager? How are photographers and inspectors selected? How are lease negotiations conducted? What are the quality checks? How are communications tracked? How long does the entire onboarding process typically take?"

    "Text": "Now, we formulate these into open-ended questions: When a property coordinator identifies missing or outdated documents, what steps are taken to obtain the updated documentation, and are there any time constraints or consequences for delays? How does the company balance the multiple factors (like workload, geography, experience) when assigning a property manager, especially when no single manager meets all criteria? What are the primary metrics used to measure the success or efficiency of the onboarding process? These questions are open-ended and aim to clarify the process without delving into technical implementation."
