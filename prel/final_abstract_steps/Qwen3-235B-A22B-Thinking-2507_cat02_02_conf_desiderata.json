For desiderata, the timing seems reasonable (all within same day), but there's no mention of Follow-up Call. Since that's optional, it's just a minor desideratum miss."

    "Text": "Case 2 immediately raises red flags. The log shows Risk Assessment happening before Credit Check - that's a direct violation of the Credit Check before Risk Assessment rule. Then after rejection, they still did Finalize Documentation, which is explicitly forbidden. And they closed the case after that improper documentation. This case is a double normative violation."

But crucially, the sequence itself is correct: all mandatory steps in order, with documentation only for approved loan. No normative violations here - just timing issues and missing Follow-up Call (which is purely optional)."

    "Text": "For justifications: In Case 2, maybe someone mistakenly thought Risk Assessment could start early, but that's not excusable per strict rules. The documentation after rejection seems like a serious error - perhaps system glitch or human mistake. Case 3's delays might be due to high workload, which explains why it's only a desideratum issue."
