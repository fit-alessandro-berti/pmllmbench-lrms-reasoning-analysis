    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "The critical non-compliance points demonstrate a fundamental breakdown in following the established loan application workflow. I see the violation involves performing a credit check after risk assessment, which disrupts the logical sequence. This out-of-order processing could potentially impact the accuracy of risk evaluation, as critical financial verification happens post-decision. The timing suggests a procedural breakdown in the loan application workflow, where standard validation steps are not being followed sequentially."
