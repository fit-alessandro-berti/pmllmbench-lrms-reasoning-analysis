    "Text": "Then, from event 4 to 7, theres a significant increase in temperature, especially around 50C and above. Material flow jumps to 5 units/s, and tool position increases to 5mm. Energy consumption also goes up to 2.00 kWh. This looks like an active operation, perhaps a cutting phase where tools are active and material is being processed."

    "Text": "At event 8, the material flow drops back to 2 units/s, and tool position is at 15mm. Temperature and pressure are back to normal. Energy usage decreases slightly. Maybe this is the end of the cutting phase, transitioning to another activity like a break or cooldown."

    "Text": "Event 9 shows a massive spike in vibration to 50Hz and material flow goes to zero. Tool position jumps to 15mm. Energy usage jumps to 5.00 kWh. This looks like a significant change. High vibration and increased energy could indicate a transition to a different activity, maybe moving to the next phase of processing."

    "Text": "In events 10 to 12, the temperature, pressure, and vibration are low again. Material flow is zero, tool position is around 15mm, and energy usage is low. This seems like the beginning of a new operation. Maybe a transition to packaging or another assembly phase."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Events 13 to 15 are similar to the initial events 1-3. Low temperature, pressure, and vibration. Material flow is zero, tool position is zero, and energy is low. This could be the start of a new cycle, possibly starting the process again."

    "Text": "So, based on these changes, I think the activities can be labeled as: 1. Preparation (events 1-3) 2. Cutting (events 4-7) 3. Break/Cooldown (events 8) 4. Transition (event 9) 5. New Cycle Start (events 10-12) 6. Preparation (events 13-15)"

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Each of these activities is characterized by distinct sensor patterns. Preparation has low activity, while cutting is marked by high material flow and temperature. The break shows a drop in activity, transition shows a spike, and new cycle starts again with low readings."
