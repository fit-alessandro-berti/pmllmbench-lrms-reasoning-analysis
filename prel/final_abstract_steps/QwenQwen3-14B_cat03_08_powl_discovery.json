Or perhaps its part of a loop? Wait, in case 1, after AS, they do IQC, then AS again. Then TST, RT, TST again. So that suggests that after IQC, theres a loop where AS is repeated until IQC passes."

Because the loop operator is * (A, B), which means execute A, then either exit or execute B and then A again. So in this case, the loop would be between TST and RT. Wait, but the structure is TST -> RT -> TST. So the loop would be * (TST, RT), which would mean that after TST, you can either exit the loop or do RT and then TST again. That seems to fit."

So perhaps the IQC is optional, but in some cases, its required. However, the presence of multiple AS steps after IQC suggests a loop between AS and IQC. But how? Alternatively, the AS is done, then IQC is done. If IQC fails, then the AS is repeated. So that would be a loop between AS and IQC. But according to the loop operator * (A, B), which is A followed by B, then repeat. So the loop would be * (AS, IQC)."

Wait, that doesnt fit. Because the loop would be AS IQC AS IQC... So after the first IQC, if the check passes, you exit the loop. But in case 1, after the first IQC, they do AS again. That suggests that the loop is not exited, which would imply that the check failed. But then why do they do AS again? That would be part of the loop."

    "Text": "This suggests that my initial approach is incorrect. The AS node in the loop1 is the same as the AS in the main sequence. So if the loop1 is executed after AS, then the AS node is executed again in the loop. But in the partial order, the initial AS is before the loop1, and the loop1 would include the AS again. This would create a loop in the partial order, which is not allowed because the partial order must be irreflexive and transitive."
