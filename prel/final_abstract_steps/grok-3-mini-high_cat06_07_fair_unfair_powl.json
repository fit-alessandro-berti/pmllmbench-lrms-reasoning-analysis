Both should include the stages: initial screening, skill-based assessments, cultural fit evaluations, and final hiring decisions. The difference is in how they handle the cultural fit and affiliation check."

    "Text": "From the description, the process has: - Resume parsing and initial data check, which includes a loop for missing information. - Preliminary skill assessment. - Cultural fit & community affiliation check with potential bias. - Managerial review and final decision. There's also a loop in the initial stage for data completeness."

    "Text": "For the first model, POWL Model with Potential Unfairness, I need to include an XOR branching after the skill assessment. One branch should be a standard cultural fit evaluation, and the other should be a CommunityAffiliationCheck that could give an advantage based on affiliations. This XOR choice introduces potential bias. For the second model, POWL Model Without Unfairness, I need to remove the XOR branching and have all applicants go through the same cultural fit evaluation."

Then a loop for data completeness: check if data is complete, if not, request more info and loop back. After the loop, if data is complete, proceed. Then, SkillAssessment. After SkillAssessment, an XOR choice: one path to standard CulturalFitCheck, and another to CommunityAffiliationCheck. Then, after the XOR, it should go to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision."

If it's complete, exit; else, execute RequestMoreInfo and then back to DataCompletenessCheck. After the loop exits (when data is complete), proceed to SkillAssessment. Then, after SkillAssessment, an XOR choice between StandardCulturalFit and CommunityAffiliationCheck. Assuming that regardless of which branch, it converges back."

    "Text": "Now, for the second model without unfairness. Similar structure, but no XOR for cultural fit. Instead, all applicants go through the same CulturalFitCheck. So, after SkillAssessment, directly to a single CulturalFitCheck, not branched. Then to ManagerialReview and FinalDecision. Also, keep the loop for data completeness."

    "Text": "In the unfair model, the XOR choice might be based on some attribute, but in POWL, we don't specify how the choice is made, just that there is a choice point, which can introduce bias. In the fair model, no such choice, all go through the same process. This captures the difference."
