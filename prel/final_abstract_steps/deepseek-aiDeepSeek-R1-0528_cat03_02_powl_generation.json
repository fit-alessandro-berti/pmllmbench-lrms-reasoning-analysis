Since it's the first step, we can model it as a transition. 2. Then Contract Setup (CS) must be done after SR. So we have an order: SR -> CS. 3. After CS, we have two tasks that can be done in parallel: DA and ACI. We can model this as a partial order with two nodes and no order between them, but both must be after CS."

However, note that after the deployment, we have two tasks (QA and SA) that must both be done. But also note that the scenario says: Once the deployment method has been chosen and completed, .... So the XOR choice leads to either CD or MD. We must also note that after the deployment, we have QA and SA which are concurrent? Actually, the scenario says: Both QA and SA must be completed before final sign-off, but they can be done in any order or even concurrently. So we can model QA and SA as a partial order with no order constraints between them."

How? We can create a StrictPartialOrder that has these blocks and then set edges: SR -> CS CS -> po_DA_ACI [but note: po_DA_ACI is a node that contains DA and ACI?] po_DA_ACI -> loop loop -> xor xor -> qa_sa qa_sa -> GLA But note: the partial order node po_DA_ACI must be defined as: po_DA_ACI = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[DA, ACI]) # no edges added -> concurrent"

Create the top-level partial order: root = StrictPartialOrder(nodes=[SR, CS, po_DA_ACI, loop, xor, qa_sa, GLA]) Add the edges to enforce the sequence: root.order.add_edge(SR, CS) root.order.add_edge(CS, po_DA_ACI) root.order.add_edge(po_DA_ACI, loop) root.order.add_edge(loop, xor) root.order.add_edge(xor, qa_sa) root.order.add_edge(qa_sa, GLA) Now, the root is the entire model. However, note: the scenario says that the process starts by verifying the initial Service Request (SR). Then Contract Setup (CS) must be done. Then the two tasks DA and ACI in parallel. Then the loop. Then the XOR. Then QA and SA in parallel. Then GLA. This model should capture that. But wait: what about the dependencies within the loop? The loop node is an operator that internally orders BNC and then optionally DR. And the XOR node internally will choose one of CD or MD. The qa_sa node internally runs QA and SA concurrently. And the top-level partial order sets the sequence: SR -> CS -> po_DA_ACI -> loop -> xor -> qa_sa -> GLA. This matches the scenario."
