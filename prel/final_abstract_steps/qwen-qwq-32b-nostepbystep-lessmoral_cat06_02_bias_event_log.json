    "Text": "This means that even if a non-local has a score of 715, which is higher than the adjusted 700 of a group member, they are rejected because their base score isn't high enough. This indicates that: The Scoring Engine's adjustment is a direct bias towards the Highland Civic Darts Club. The LocalResident status might also influence the cutoff, making it harder for non-locals. This would disadvantage non-members of the group and non-locals, even if their base scores are similar to others after adjustments. The problem is that the scoring system is giving an automatic boost to a specific community group, which isn't based on their individual merit. Additionally, the LocalResident status might be another factor. So, the main sources of bias are: 1. The explicit +10 adjustment for Highland Civic Darts Club members. 2. Potentially, a lower score threshold for LocalResidents. This means that: Members of the Highland Civic Darts Club receive an automatic 10-point boost, giving them an advantage over non-members with the same preliminary score. Non-locals need a higher score (like 720) to be approved, whereas locals can get in with lower scores (like 700). This creates inequity. For example, a non-local with a 715 (C003) is rejected, while a local in the group with 690 +10 =700 is approved. Even though the non-local's base score is higher (715 vs 700 after adjustment), they are rejected because their base was below the non-local cutoff. Therefore, the scoring system is biased in favor of the Highland Civic Darts Club members via the +10, and in favor of Local residents by having a lower threshold."
