The claim goes through: Claim Registration (CR) Document Verification (DV) If documents are incomplete, it loops back via Re Document Submission (RDS). So, after DV, if needed, RDS happens, and then back to DV again. This suggests a loop between DV and RDS. After DV (when documents are complete), it proceeds to Fraud Check (FC). If FC raises doubts, it goes into In depth Investigation (II). This can happen multiple times, so another loop between FC and II. After FC/II, it moves to Claim Assessment (CA). Then, Approval (AP) if the amount is above a threshold. After approval, Payment (P) is made. Notification (N) is sent. Finally, Closure (CL) marks the end."
