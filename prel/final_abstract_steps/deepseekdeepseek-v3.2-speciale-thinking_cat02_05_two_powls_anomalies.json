So after Screen, both Decide and Interview become enabled? However, there is no edge between Interview and Decide, so they are concurrent? Actually, the partial order: nodes with edges indicating that source must happen before target. So after Screen, both Decide and Interview are allowed to happen, but there is no ordering between them. So they could be in any order, or even concurrent if resources allow. However, the typical process: screening leads to interviews, then decide. So having Decide immediately after Screen without interviews is odd."

Actually, Onboard depends on Decide, not on Interview. So you could decide, then onboard, and then later conduct interviews? That is weird. So model1 allows sequences where Decide occurs before Interview, and Onboard even before Interview. This violates the expected order: interviews must be before hiring decision."

So essentially, the loop can repeat Onboard, but the rework is just a silent step; after Onboard, you may either exit the loop (go to next) or loop again (by executing skip then Onboard?). Actually, skip is silent, so its effectively a direct repeat: you could loop any number of times (including zero? No, do part executes at least once). So its a loop on Onboard; you can onboard multiple times? That might be odd: onboarding a single employee multiple times?"

Model1 also has Screen -> Decide is okay but decision should also require interview; it doesnt. Model2 fails to capture screening before interview. So model2s screening is completely disconnected.
