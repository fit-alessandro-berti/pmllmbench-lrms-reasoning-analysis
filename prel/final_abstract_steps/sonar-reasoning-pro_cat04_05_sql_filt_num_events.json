Also, result [7] mentions using GROUP BY and HAVING in a subquery and then joining back. In example [1], theres a query using GROUP BY and then filtering with HAVING alert_count > 3. So combining that with a JOIN seems valid. Alternatively, looking at result [10], DuckDBs FILTER clause is discussed but thats more for aggregate functions within selects, not for this scenario."

    "Text": "So both methods are possible: either using a CTE/subquery with GROUP BY and HAVING, then joining back, or using a window function in a subquery and filtering. Which one is more efficient? In many databases, using a window function might require a full scan and partition computation, while the GROUP BY approach could be optimized with indexes (but DuckDB is columnar and doesnt use indexes). Maybe both are similar in performance here. But since the user specified DuckDB, perhaps either approach works. Let me draft both options and see which one is better. First approach with CTE and JOIN: WITH case_counts AS ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e INNER JOIN case_counts c ON e.case_id = c.case_id; Alternatively: SELECT e.* FROM event_log e WHERE e.case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 ); The IN clause might also work here. Which is better? In terms of readability, perhaps the IN clause is simpler. Another option using EXISTS: SELECT * FROM event_log e WHERE EXISTS ( SELECT 1 FROM event_log WHERE case_id = e.case_id GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 ); But this might be less efficient because its correlated."

    "Text": "But let me check if any of the search results have examples similar to this. Looking at result [7], theres an example using GROUP BY and then unnesting aggregates with max_by. But thats for top N per group. Result [4] shows basic GROUP BY with HAVING: SELECT category, COUNT(*) AS total_items, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE price > 100) AS expensive_items FROM products GROUP BY category; So GROUP BY and HAVING are standard here. In example [1], theres: SELECT device.hostname AS host, device.type AS device_type, COUNT(*) AS alert_count FROM read_json({LOCAL_JSON}) WHERE status != Suppressed GROUP BY device.hostname, device_type HAVING alert_count > 3 So they group by hostname and type, filter with HAVING on alert_count. But in our problem, grouping by case_id alone would suffice. Thus, using a subquery with IN or EXISTS would work. Alternatively, window function."

    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "I think both approaches are valid. But perhaps using IN with a subquery is more straightforward here. So final answer would be: Option 1: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id IN ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <= 6 ); Option 2 (window function): SELECT * FROM ( SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log ) WHERE event_count <= 6; But since we dont need to show the event_count in the output, maybe we can select only original columns: SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp FROM ( SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log ) WHERE event_count <= 6; Alternatively: SELECT * EXCLUDE (event_count) FROM ( SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log ) WHERE event_count <=6; But DuckDB supports SELECT * EXCLUDE syntax? Yes, according to DuckDB docs (not in provided search results but known feature), you can use EXCLUDE to remove columns. However, if we dont know that for sure or want to avoid relying on it, selecting all original columns explicitly would be safer. Alternatively, use * in inner query but then exclude in outer query if supported. But perhaps better to write without relying on EXCLUDE: Assuming all columns are needed except event_count: In inner query: select *, COUNT(...) as event_count Then outer query: select all columns except event_count by listing them explicitly. But if there are many columns or dynamic schema thats not known upfront, this could be an issue. However, given that the problem states the table has at least certain columns but possibly othersso perhaps * is acceptable in output as long as we exclude the added column. Alternatively: For claritys sake and assuming that there may be other columns besides case_id, activity, timestampmaybe just leave * but note that it includes event_count? Nothis problem says returns only the events from cases... which implies returning all original columns without additional ones like event_count. So we need to exclude that column. Hence: SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp list all necessary columns here. FROM ( SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log ) WHERE event_count <=6; But if there are other columns beyond these three in event_log, then listing them all would be tedious. Alternatively use * EXCLUDE if supported. But based on provided search results: In [10], theres an example of FILTER clause but no mention of EXCLUDE syntax. However,DuckDB does support this feature as per their documentation elsewhere. Assuming EXCLUDE is allowed: SELECT * EXCLUDE (event_count) FROM ( SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id) AS event_count FROM event_log ) WHERE event_count <=6; This way we get all original columns without including event_count. Alternatively: Using a CTE to calculate counts and join back avoids adding any extra column: WITH valid_cases AS ( SELECT case_id FROM event_log GROUP BY case_id HAVING COUNT(*) <=6 ) SELECT e.* FROM event_log e JOIN valid_cases v ON e.case_id = v.case_id; This approach doesnt add any new columns and directly joins to get only valid cases events. Which method is better? The CTE/join method or IN-subquery? In terms of performance: Depending on DuckDBs optimizer. Joins can sometimes be more efficient than IN clauses if properly optimized. But both methods should achieve the same result. Given that both methods work correctly but perhaps using JOIN with CTE is clearer for readability."
