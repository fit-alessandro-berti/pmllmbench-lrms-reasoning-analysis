        "Text": "### Explanation of the Logic\n\n#### Case Identification\n- A \"case\" is defined based on the \"Window\" attribute until a \"CLOSE\" action is encountered or another \"FOCUS\" action on a different window occurs. For instance, once the user focuses on \"Document1.docx\", all subsequent actions until a \"CLOSE\" action or another \"FOCUS\" action on a different window like \"Email - Inbox\" are grouped under the case ID \"Document1.docx\".\n    \n    However, \"Email - Inbox\" seems to be a different kind of \"case\" where the user handles an email. Thus, the \"Email - Inbox\" itself could be a case until a switch to a new window like \"Report_Draft.pdf\" occurs.\n\n#### Activity Naming\n    - \"FOCUS\" actions are interpreted as \"Open Document\" if it is the first time a window is focused on within a case.\n    - \"TYPING\" actions are interpreted as \"Edit Document\".\n    - \"SAVE\" actions are interpreted as \"Save Document\".\n    - \"SWITCH\" actions indicate a change of focus from one app and window to another. However, the \"SWITCH\" action itself is part of the \"FromWindow\" case until a new \"FOCUS\" action is defined.\n    - \"CLICK\" actions are given a name based on the \"Action\" attribute such as \"Open Email about Annual Meeting\" or \"Reply to Email\".\n    - \"SCROLL\" actions are interpreted as \"Scroll Document\" or \"Scroll Email\" or \"Scroll PDF\" based on the application.\n    - \"HIGHLIGHT\" actions are interpreted as \"Highlight Text in PDF\" for Adobe Acrobat.\n    - \"CLOSE\" actions are interpreted as \"Close Document\".\n\n#### Event Attributes\n    - Case ID: This is derived from the \"Window\" attribute until a \"CLOSE\" action is given or a new \"FOCUS\" action on a different window occurs.\n    - Activity Name: Translated from raw actions such as \"FOCUS\" to \"Open Document\", \"TYPING\" to \"Edit Document\", etc.\n    - Timestamp: The original timestamp from the log."
