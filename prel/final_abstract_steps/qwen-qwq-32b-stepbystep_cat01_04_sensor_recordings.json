For these first three events, the Temperature is around 20C, Pressure is 1 bar, Vibration is 0 Hz, Material Flow is 0 units/s, Tool Position is 0 mm, and Energy is around 0.5 kWh. These seem like stable conditions, maybe the machine is idling or preparing. But then at Event 4, things change. Temperature jumps to 50C, Vibration goes up to 30 Hz, Material Flow is 5 units/s, Tool Position is 5 mm, and Energy increases to 2.00 kWh. This sudden increase might indicate the start of an activity."

High temperature and vibration, along with material flow, might suggest cutting. But let me check further."

Since cutting often involves material flow, which is at 5 here, maybe that's cutting metal. Events 7-8: Lower temp, lower vibration, but still some material flow. Maybe assembling parts where parts are being placed? The tool might be placing parts. Event 9: Spikes in temp and vibration, no material flow. Definitely welding. Event 10: Then a drop, maybe cooling down or moving to next step. Events 11-12: Lower temp, some material flow again, maybe packaging or moving parts. Or maybe a quality check? Not sure yet. Events 13-15: Back to starting conditions. Probably end of cycle or reset."

Maybe that's part of the assembly. Then in 11-12, it's 1 unit/s. Maybe packaging involves moving parts out? Looking at the Energy consumption: High during active phases. The highest at Event 9 (5 kWh) which aligns with welding. The cutting phase (4-6) uses 2-3 kWh, which is moderate. Assembly or other steps use lower energy. Looking at the tool positions: In Events 4-6, tool position moves from 5 to 10 mm. Maybe cutting at lower positions. Then in 7-8, it's 15 mm. Maybe assembling involves moving to a higher position. Welding at 15 mm (Event 9)."

    "Text": "Wait, but the problem states that the activities should be like cutting, assembling, welding, etc. So let's see: Cutting: High temp, vibration, material flow. So that's Phase 2 (4-6). Welding: Event 9 is definitely high temp and vibration with no material flow. So that's welding. Assembling: Maybe Events 7-8. The material flow is lower, maybe parts are being assembled but not as intense as cutting. But tool position is moving up, maybe moving parts into place. What about Event 10? After welding, maybe moving parts again, but the material flow is 0. Maybe that's a transition phase. Events 11-12 have material flow 1, maybe packaging? Or maybe some inspection? Since inspection might not need high energy, but the problem mentions quality inspection as a possible label. Wait, the problem mentions Quality Inspection as a possible activity. When does that happen? Quality inspection might involve checking the welded parts, so maybe after welding (event 9), they do inspection. But the readings for inspection might be low energy, maybe just checking visually. But how would that show in the sensors? Maybe low vibration, moderate temp. Let's see Event 10: temp 30, vibration 1, material flow 0. That could be inspection."

    "Text": "Alternatively, maybe Event 10 is part of cooling down, and 11-12 are packaging. Alternatively, maybe the quality inspection is when the machine isn't doing much, so maybe Event 10 is inspection, with low energy and vibration. Alternatively, if I can't find a clear inspection phase, maybe it's not present here, but the problem's examples include it, so perhaps I need to find where it fits. Alternatively, maybe event 10 is the inspection. Then Events 11-12: Packaging (material flow 1 unit/s, moving to 20mm position, lower energy)."

The temperature is lower (30), so maybe after cooling, they check it. Packaging (11-12: material flow 1, moving to position 20mm, lower energy, which could be moving the final product into packaging. Events 1,2,3 are setup/idle, not labeled as an activity. Similarly, 13-15 are end phases. This covers all the example labels except maybe the inspection is only event10.
