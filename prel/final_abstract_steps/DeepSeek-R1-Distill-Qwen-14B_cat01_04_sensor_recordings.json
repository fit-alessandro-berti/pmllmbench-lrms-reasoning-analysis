    "Text": "Event 4 jumps to 50°C, which is a significant increase. Pressure is still 1 bar, but vibration goes up to 30 Hz. Material flow starts at 5 units/s, and tool position moves to 5mm. Energy usage jumps to 2.00 kWh. This seems like the machine is starting an operation that involves moving parts, maybe something mechanical like cutting or drilling."

    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Events 5 and 6 show temperature rising further to 58°C, pressure increases slightly to 1.5 bar, vibration goes up to 38 Hz. Material flow remains steady, tool position increases to 10mm, and energy goes up to 3.00 kWh. The increasing temperature and vibration suggest that the machine is working harder, possibly in a cutting phase where materials are being processed, causing more friction and wear."

    "Text": "Event 7 drops temperature to 40°C, pressure increases to 2 bar, and vibration is 10 Hz. Material flow drops to 2 units/s, tool position is still at 15mm, and energy is back to 2.00 kWh. This might indicate a transition. Maybe the cutting has stopped, but the machine is still moving or adjusting."

    "Text": "Events 8 and 9 keep temperature around 40°C, pressure steady at 2 bar, vibration at 10 Hz. Material flow is 2 units/s, tool position remains at 15mm, but energy spikes to 5.00 kWh. Wait, that's a big jump in energy. Maybe the machine is moving the tool back to its position, or perhaps the tool is being repositioned, which requires more energy."

    "Text": "Event 10 drops temperature significantly to 30°C, pressure goes down to 1 bar, vibration is 1 Hz, material flow is 0, tool position is still at 15mm, and energy drops to 1.00 kWh. This looks like a major transition. The machine is cooling down, pressure is low, and everything is stabilizing."

This seems like another phase. Maybe the machine is moving to a different station or preparing for a new operation."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Events 13 to 15 repeat the initial pattern of low temperature, pressure, vibration, material flow, and energy. It seems like the machine is starting a new cycle, maybe repeating the earlier steps but perhaps in a different sequence or at a different phase."
