The system checks for completeness. If complete, move on. If not complete, request more info and then check again. This is a classic * ( A, B ) structure in POWL, where A is the check and B is the request for info. Lets define the activities: ReceiveApplication: The starting point. DataCompletenessCheck: The check part of the loop (A). RequestMoreInfo: The action taken if data is incomplete (B). So, the loop will be * ( DataCompletenessCheck, RequestMoreInfo ). Step 2: Preliminary Skill Assessment: This happens after the data completeness loop. Its a single activity: SkillAssessment. Theres a score threshold. If below, the process ends (reject). If above, it continues."

    "Text": "Step 3: Cultural Fit & Community Affiliation Check (The Bias Point): This is the key difference between the two models. Model 1 (With Unfairness): An XOR choice is made here. Branch 1: CulturalFitCheck (standard path). Branch 2: CommunityAffiliationCheck (biased path). The description says this path gives an implicit score adjustment. Ill model this as a distinct activity. The choice itself is the source of bias. So, this is XOR ( CulturalFitCheck, CommunityAffiliationCheck ). Model 2 (Without Unfairness): No XOR choice. Everyone goes through the same activity. Just a single activity: CulturalFitCheck. Step 4: Managerial Review & Final Decision: This happens after the cultural fit stage (regardless of which path was taken in Model 1). Activities: ManagerialReview, then FinalDecision. The FinalDecision activity should probably be an XOR choice itself: Hire vs. Reject. This makes the model more complete."

    "Text": "Final Code Generation Plan: 1. Import necessary classes: StrictPartialOrder, OperatorPOWL, Transition, SilentTransition, Operator. 2. Define all the Transition objects with their labels for both models. I can reuse them. 3. For Model 1: Create the loop_node (*). Create the xor_skill_outcome (XOR). Create the xor_cultural_branch (XOR). This is the key part. Create the xor_final_decision (XOR). Create the root StrictPartialOrder with all the necessary nodes (ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_skill_outcome, xor_cultural_branch, ManagerialReview, xor_final_decision). Add the edges to define the sequence of execution. 4. For Model 2: Create the loop_node (*). Same as Model 1. Create the xor_skill_outcome (XOR). Same as Model 1. Do NOT create the xor_cultural_branch. Instead, use the single CulturalFitCheck activity directly. Create the xor_final_decision (XOR). Same as Model 1. Create the root StrictPartialOrder with the nodes: ReceiveApplication, loop_node, SkillAssessment, xor_skill_outcome, CulturalFitCheck, ManagerialReview, xor_final_decision. Add the edges to define the sequence of execution. 5. Add comments to explain each part of the code, especially highlighting the difference between the two models. 6. Wrap the code in a clear, well-structured response as requested by the user. I will provide two separate code blocks, one for each model."
