    "Text": "The first four steps are initial actions with the metal sheet. Retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating all seem like steps to get the material ready for the next stages. That seems like preparation. So maybe 'Material Preparation' as the first high-level step."

    "Text": "Then picking up the welding tool and welding corners. That's an assembly or welding step, right? So perhaps 'Welding Assembly.' Following that is measuring the weld integrity. That's a quality check, so maybe 'Quality Check (Weld Integrity).' Then comes applying coating and drying it—that’s part of protecting or finishing the product. So maybe 'Coating Application' or 'Coating Process.'"

    "Text": "So, formalizing this: 1. Material Preparation: Includes retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating. These are all actions taken before any assembly. 2. Welding Assembly: The operator picks up the tool, welds the corners. The next step is measuring the integrity, but that's a quality check on the weld. So 'Weld Quality Inspection.' 3. Coating Process: Application and drying are sequential steps. 4. Final Visual Inspection: The visual check might be a final inspection after all other phases."

    "Text": "Looking at A1 again: After preheating (step 5, part of Material Prep) comes welding steps (6-7), then measure (8) which is inspection, then coating steps (9-10), then visual check (11). So grouping that way."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Material Preparation: All steps up to preheating because they set up the metal sheet for welding. Welding Assembly: the steps involving the operator doing the welding tasks. Post-weld Quality Check: the measure weld integrity step. Coating Process: coating application followed by drying. Final Inspection: visual check by operator C."

    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, but the event 'pick up welding tool' is a low-level action—picking the tool is part of the preparation for welding. Should this be grouped differently? Alternatively, since the welding can't happen without picking up the tool, maybe that is part of the welding assembly."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Another point: The alignment and preheating in 'Material Prep': alignment is done by a Robot, preheating by a heating unit. Since they are all done on the material before moving to the next stage, they are logically part of 'Material Preparation.'"

    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Alternative name considerations: Maybe 'Coating Application and Drying' but 'Coating Process' is concise. Also, 'Weld Quality Check' vs. Inspection. The grouping should be process-oriented rather than by resource, and these names make sense."
