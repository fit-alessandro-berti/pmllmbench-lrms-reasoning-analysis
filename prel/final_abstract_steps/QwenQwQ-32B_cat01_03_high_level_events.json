    "Text": "Alright, let me tackle this problem step by step. I need to group these low-level events into higher-level process steps. Lets start by looking at the sample events provided for cases A1 and B2. First, Ill go through each event in case A1 and see how they might naturally group together. Lets list them out:\n\n1. Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A)\n2. Scan barcode (Operator A)\n3. Place metal sheet on table (Operator A)\n4. Align metal sheet (Robot Arm #2)\n5. Preheat metal sheet (Heating Unit #1)\n6. Pick up welding tool (Operator B)\n7. Weld corner A and B (Operator B)\n8. Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1)\n9. Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3)\n10. Dry coating (Heating Unit #2)\n11. Visual check (Operator C)"

    "Text": "Hmm. Let me see the temporal flow here. The first four steps are initial actions with the metal sheet. Retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating all seem like steps to get the material ready for the next stages. That seems like preparation. So maybe Material Preparation as the first high-level step."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Then picking up the welding tool and welding corners. Thats an assembly or welding step, right? So perhaps Welding Assembly. Following that is measuring the weld integrity. Thats a quality check, so maybe Quality Check (Weld Integrity)."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Then comes applying coating and drying it thats part of protecting or finishing the product. So maybe Coating Application or Coating Process."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Finally, the visual check is another quality inspection. Since theres both measuring and visual check, those could group under different quality steps, but the visual check at the end might be a final inspection. Perhaps Final Quality Inspection."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but in the sample events for both cases, the order is consistent. Let me check for case B2 to confirm the pattern holds. The same steps follow the same sequence, so the groupings should be consistent."

  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "So, formalizing this:\n\n1. Material Preparation: Includes retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, preheating. These are all actions taken before any assembly. The alignment and preheating by different resources (Operator A, Robot, Heating) but theyre all part of prep."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, should the measurement of weld integrity be part of Quality Control or part of Welding? Since the event is explicitly a quality check (measure), its probably a separate step. So Weld Quality Inspection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Then Coating Application and Drying would fall into Coating Process, combining application and drying since those are sequential steps. The final visual check is another quality step, so maybe Final Visual Inspection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Hypothesis Generation - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, but the visual check also comes after coating and drying. So after the coating step, theres a visual check. Therefore, the high-level steps Im thinking:\n\n1. Material Preparation\n2. Welding Assembly\n3. Weld Quality Inspection\n4. Coating Process\n5. Final Visual Inspection\n\nDoes that make sense with the events?"

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Looking at A1 again:\n\nEvents 1-5: Material Prep\n6-7: Weld Assembly (plus 6 is Pick up tool which is part of preparing to weld, then welding)\n8: Weld Inspection\n9-10: Coating Process\n11: Final Visual.\n\nSo grouping that way."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Wait, the pick up welding tool is part of the assembly. So grouping the actions of actually doing the welding and tool setup? But the event pick up welding tool is a low-level action. Alternatively, since the welding cant happen without picking up the tool, maybe that is part of the welding assembly."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Counterfactual Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Wait, but Coating Process might be better since application and drying are part of the coating phase. Alternatively, the visual check is a final inspection after coating. So maybe Final Quality Inspection includes that, but in the event log its a single step. Alternatively, perhaps all quality checks are separate. Alternatively, maybe Quality Checks can be broken into specific types, such as Weld Integrity Check and Final Visual Inspection. Alternatively, maybe group the initial steps, and then the quality steps after each major process."

  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Anyway, lets outline the steps. The final output requires names, groupings with rationales. Another thing to consider the resources: \n\nMaterial Prep uses Operator A, Robot Arm, Heating Unit.\nWelding uses Operator B and the tool.\nQuality (weld) by Sensor.\nCoating by Coating Unit and other heating.\nVisual Check by Operator C.\n\nTemporal sequence holds across the cases. \n\nSo grouping rationale:\n\nMaterial Preparation: All steps up to preheating because they set up the metal sheet for welding. \n\nWelding Assembly: the steps involving the operator B doing the welding. \n\nPost-weld Quality Check: the measure by the sensor. \n\nCoating Process: coating application and drying. \n\nFinal Inspection: visual check by operator C."

  {
    "Name": "Heuristic Reasoning - IND",
    "Text": "Alternative name considerations: Maybe Coating Application and Drying but Coating Process is concise. Also, Weld Quality Check vs. Inspection."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "I think this grouping makes sense. Now, lets check if theres another possible grouping. Are there other steps which could be combined? The quality inspection after coating? In the event log, after coating is applied and dried, theres the visual inspection. So thats captured as the last step. Another angle: Operator involvement. The material prep involves several roles, but the grouping is based on process phase. Yes, the grouping should be process-oriented rather than by resource. So the initial approach holds. So finalizing: High-level activities with names, groupings, and justifications."
