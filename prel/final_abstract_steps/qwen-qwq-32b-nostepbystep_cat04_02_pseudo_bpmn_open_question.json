Reducing manual approvals through automated approval based on predictive models. 6. Streamlining the loop paths (like if approval is denied, how to loop back efficiently)."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Let me try to map these ideas into changes: First, add a predictive analytics step early on. So after Task A (Receive Request), instead of going straight to the XOR gateway, run a predictive analysis (Task A2: Predict Request Complexity and Feasibility). This task uses ML models based on historical data to assess whether the request is likely standard or custom, and maybe even predict feasibility for custom. This could allow the system to start some tasks in parallel or adjust resource allocation before the actual decision is made. The output of Task A2 could feed into the XOR gateway, but maybe even influence which path to take more accurately, reducing the chance of misclassification. So instead of a strict XOR based solely on explicit type, it's a blend of explicit and predictive data. Then, in the Standard path (B1), maybe the validations can be automated. For example, credit check and inventory check could be fully automated APIs, reducing human intervention. That would speed up those parallel tasks. For the Custom path (B2), the feasibility analysis could be partly automated. Maybe using historical data and predictive models to suggest feasibility, then a human just reviews. This could cut down time. In the XOR after B2 (Feasibility), maybe instead of a strict yes/no, have a confidence level. If the model is unsure, maybe escalate to a specialist, but if confident, proceed automatically. That could speed things up. The approval step (Task F) could be handled by an AI model that evaluates the request's parameters (like value, risk, etc.) and approves automatically if within thresholds. But still have a manual check for higher-risk cases. This reduces time. Dynamic resource allocation: Maybe after the predictive analysis (Task A2), if a request is flagged as high priority or requires more resources, the system can assign more analysts or prioritize their tasks in the queue. This would require some subprocesses that monitor workload and allocate resources, but that's more of an orchestration layer. Another idea: After the predictive step, if the system predicts a high chance of needing customization, it can proactively start some tasks that are common in the custom path, even while still processing the standard path. But that might complicate, but could save time if the prediction is accurate. Wait, but in the current process, the gateway splits into either standard or custom. So before that split, the predictive model could suggest, and maybe start some parallel tasks. For example, if the prediction is 60% custom, maybe start both paths in a conditional way, then merge later. Not sure if that's efficient, but could save time if the prediction is accurate. Alternatively, have a subprocess for request classification that uses both the explicit type and predictive analysis to decide the best path. Also, after generating the invoice (Task G), which is after approval), maybe add a step to assess the customer's history to see if they usually require custom requests, so future requests from them get prioritized or handled differently."
  },
  {
    "Name": "Pattern Recognition - PE",
    "Text": "Let me structure the changes step by step: 1. Enhanced Initial Analysis with Predictive Analytics: Insert a new Task after A: Predictive Analysis of Request Type and Complexity. Uses ML models based on historical data to predict if the request is likely custom, high-risk, or needs special handling. This task feeds into the XOR gateway, possibly influencing the path taken, but maybe even starting some tasks in parallel. 2. Automating Validation and Feasibility Steps: Automate Tasks B1 (Standard Validation) and B2 (Custom Feasibility Analysis) using RPA or AI. For example, credit checks can pull from APIs automatically, inventory checks can query databases. For feasibility analysis, maybe a machine learning model can assess feasibility based on similar past requests, providing a feasibility score. Humans then only review if the score is borderline. 3. Dynamic Task Routing Based on Predictions: If the predictive analysis suggests a high likelihood of custom, the process could branch into the Custom path even if the user selected standard, or vice versa. Maybe a decision point that considers both the explicit type and the prediction, leading to a more accurate path. 4. Parallel Processing Where Possible: Maybe start some tasks in parallel even before the gateway. For example, if the predictive model suggests a high chance of being custom, start feasibility analysis in parallel with standard validations, then merge later. But need to ensure that doesn't cause redundancy. 5. Automated Approval Decisions: Task F (Obtain Manager Approval) could be replaced with an automated approval based on predefined criteria (e.g., value under X, certain parameters met). Only higher-risk cases go to manual approval. This reduces wait times. 6. Feedback Loop for Continuous Improvement: After the process is completed, collect data on accuracy of predictions, approval outcomes, etc., to train the models further. This is a subprocess after the End Event, maybe as a feedback loop. 7. Dynamic Resource Allocation Subprocess: A subprocess that monitors the process instances and allocates resources (like assigning more analysts to the feasibility team if many custom requests are coming in). This could be a background task that dynamically adjusts based on current load. 8. Optimizing the Loop Path (H: Re-evaluate Conditions): If approval is denied (Task H), instead of looping back, maybe have a task that automatically adjusts parameters (like price, delivery time) to meet approval requirements, then loop back with the revised plan, reducing manual rework. 9. Intelligent Task Prioritization: The system could prioritize tasks in parallel paths (C1, C2) based on which is more time-sensitive. For example, if inventory is usually quick, focus on credit check first if that's the bottleneck. 10. Automated Quotation Generation (Task E1): Use AI to generate a draft quotation based on similar past quotes, which the team can then review, saving time."

Potential new tasks: Task A2: Predictive Analysis Subprocess for dynamic resource allocation Subprocess for automated approval Feedback subprocess after completion Now, how does this affect performance? Turnaround time should decrease because of automation and parallelism. Flexibility is increased because predictive analytics can handle edge cases better. Operational complexity might increase due to more subprocesses and predictive models, but the benefits in speed and accuracy could offset that. Need to ensure that the predictive models are well-maintained. Possible new gateways: After A2, a gateway chooses between standard, custom, or review path (for uncertain cases). After feasibility (B2), a gateway determines if auto-quote is sufficient or needs manual input. Impact on customer satisfaction: Faster quotes, accurate predictions reduce misroutes, leading to better service. Operational complexity: More tech infrastructure needed for ML models, APIs for automated checks, and dynamic resource management systems. Training staff on new tools, but less time on repetitive tasks. Possible issues: Over-reliance on models could lead to errors if models aren't accurate. Need checks in place.
