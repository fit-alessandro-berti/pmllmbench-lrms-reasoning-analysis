Then the invoice is received and payment is released. Then later the Purchase Requisition is approved. This is problematic because the approval should happen before issuing the PO. Issuing a PO without approval is a violation of internal controls and may lead to unauthorized purchases. - Also, the goods are received after the payment is released. Typically, you would receive the goods before paying (to ensure you got what you ordered). Releasing payment before receiving goods is risky because you might pay for goods you never receive."

This is problematic because: * You should not pay before receiving the goods (unless its a prepayment, but in standard P2P, payment is after goods receipt and invoice matching). * Also, the invoice matching (Match Invoice to PO) is done after the payment, which should be done before. Matching the invoice to the PO is a critical step to verify the invoice amount and terms before payment. - The sequence of events is: Issue PO -> Release Payment -> Vendor Invoice Received -> Receive Goods -> Match Invoice to PO This is highly problematic because: * The payment is released without having the invoice? How do you know the amount to pay? Without the invoice, you cannot verify the amount. * The goods are received after the payment. Again, you should receive goods before paying (unless there is a specific arrangement, but typically not in standard P2P). * The matching of the invoice to the PO is done after payment, which is too late. The matching should be done to verify the payment."

This is highly unusual because the PO is the document that authorizes the vendor to deliver the goods. Receiving goods without a PO means there is no formal purchase order, which is a risk for unauthorized goods and may lead to disputes with the vendor about the order details. - Also, the PO is issued after receiving the goods. This is backwards. The PO should be issued before the vendor ships the goods."

    "Text": "**Why these are problematic?** - **Unauthorized Purchases:** Issuing a PO without approval (Case 1002) bypasses internal controls and may lead to purchases that are not budgeted or approved. - **Payment Risks:** Releasing payment before receiving goods (Cases 1002, 1003) means the company pays without having the goods, which may result in financial loss if the vendor does not deliver. Also, releasing payment without an invoice (Case 1003) is risky because the amount to pay is not verified. - **Lack of Verification:** Matching the invoice to the PO after payment (Case 1003) means that if there is a discrepancy, it is too late to withhold payment. This may lead to overpayment or disputes that are harder to resolve. - **Unordered Goods:** Receiving goods without a PO (Case 1004) means there is no formal agreement with the vendor and the company may receive goods that are not needed or at incorrect terms. It also raises the question of how the vendor knew to send the goods without a PO."
