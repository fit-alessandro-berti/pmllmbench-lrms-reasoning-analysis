    "Text": "Precedence: e.g., DD precedes TFC and CE (but not necessarily directly). Succession: e.g., TFC succession PC meaning after TFC eventually PC appears after any number of events including zero? Actually succession is similar to precedence but reversed direction? In DECLARE semantics: - response(A,B): If A occurs then B must occur afterwards somewhere later in the same trace. - precedence(A,B): If B occurs then A must have occurred before it somewhere earlier in the same trace. - succession(A,B): Equivalent to \"response\" + \"precedence\" + adjacency constraint that no other event between them – basically ensures that every time A happens it is immediately succeeded by B without any intervening events except possibly repeated As? Actually I think succession requires that every time you see an instance of A you see an instance of B right after it as its direct successor within the same trace – no other events allowed between them except possibly repeated As?? Wait I'm mixing up definitions from Declare's original paper: Let's quickly recall definitions from memory: Constraints types defined originally include: existence(X) absence(X) init(X) last(X) response(X,Y) : X implies Y eventually follows X somewhere later in log/traces alternate_response(X,Y) : X implies Y eventually follows X somewhere later AND Y cannot appear without preceding X precedence(X,Y) : Y implies X occurred earlier alternate_precedence(X,Y) : Y implies X occurred earlier AND X cannot appear without following Y chain_response(X,Y,Z) ??? Actually chain_response ensures sequence XYZ ? But I'm not fully certain about succcession vs chain_succession vs alt_succession etc. However given scenario likely expects simple mapping using these keys as described earlier—they want us to produce dictionary entries accordingly even though semantics may differ slightly—they just want representation structure wise rather than deep semantics correctness."

    "Text": "Thus produce dictionary with keys mapping each rule type to sub-dictionaries mapping relevant activities pairs or singletons accordingly along with support=1.0 confidence=1.0 values. For pair-based rules like responded_existence etc., they said value dict containing as keys the activities and corresponding value support & confidence—maybe they expect nested dicts mapping second element too? They didn't specify nested structure precisely—just says \"value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence\". That suggests each key maps directly to tuple/dict [support=...,confidence=...] . But for pair-based constraints like responded_existence(DD,TFC), they'd need two-level dict or list-of-tuples representation—they didn't specify nested structure beyond single-level key->value pair referencing an activity only—not pair-of-events! So perhaps they intend each constraint type's dictionary contains only singletons representing individual atomic constraints on single activity rather than pairs—like existence('IG'):{'IG':{'support':1,'confidence':1}} ; responded_existence('DD'):{'DD':{'support':...}} ; This seems odd because responded_existence normally involves two events—but maybe they treat it generically where key refers to antecedent event only; actual consequent event encoded elsewhere via naming convention e.g., respond_Exist_DD_TFC ? However given instructions ambiguous—they say \"For keys {...}, value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities\". That indicates only single-level mapping from activity names to metrics regardless whether constraint involves one or more events—so they'd ignore second part details—they just store metrics per involved activity across all constraints referencing it perhaps aggregated across different relations?"

But this would duplicate entries across multiple types—for example IG appears under init & existence & exactly_one etc.—makes sense though duplicates allowed since separate contexts considered separately."
