We can set existence for all activities. Absence: maybe none of them should be absent? But absence rule would mean that an activity should not occur; but in this process, none are absent; so absence rule might not be used. Exactly_one: maybe exactly one occurrence of some activities like Final Launch (FL) per trace; also maybe only one Idea Generation per product idea; but there could be multiple ideas per product? Usually one idea per product concept; but we can set exactly_one for IG and FL. Init: initial activity is Idea Generation (IG). So init rule with IG as key with support 1.0 and confidence 1.0."

For example, if Design Draft occurs, then Technical Feasibility Check must occur later; or if Cost Evaluation occurs then Prototype Creation must follow; etc. But responded_existence means that if A occurs then B will eventually occur later somewhere in the trace (not necessarily adjacent). That fits above chain-like dependencies."

    "Text": "But I'm not fully certain about succcession vs chain_succession vs alt_succession etc. However given scenario likely expects simple mapping using these keys as described earlier they want us to produce dictionary entries accordingly even though semantics may differ slightly they just want representation structure wise rather than deep semantics correctness."

    "Text": "For pair-based rules like responded_existence etc., they said value dict containing as keys the activities and corresponding value support & confidence maybe they expect nested dicts mapping second element too? They didn't specify nested structure precisely just says value is a dictionary containing as keys the activities and as corresponding value the support (1.0) and confidence. That suggests each key maps directly to tuple/dict [support=...,confidence=...] . But for pair-based constraints like responded_existence(DD,TFC), they'd need two-level dict or list-of-tuples representation they didn't specify nested structure beyond single-level key->value pair referencing an activity only not pair-of-events! So perhaps they intend each constraint type's dictionary contains only singletons representing individual atomic constraints on single activity rather than pairs"
