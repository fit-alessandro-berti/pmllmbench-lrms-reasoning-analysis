    "Text": "First, I need to analyze the DECLARE model constraints carefully. The noncoexistence between E and C directly conflicts with the intended process flow where evaluation must happen before closing. The responded_existence rule also seems problematic because it only requires A to exist if E exists, but doesn't enforce the proper ordering."

I'll avoid any markdown and keep it in plain text with clear sections as requested. The queries should use proper joins and consider all relevant tables like claim_events and claims."
