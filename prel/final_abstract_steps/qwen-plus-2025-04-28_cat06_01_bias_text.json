    "Text": "So the key point here is that the system automatically gives a boost to applicants who have a local address or membership in the club Even though its not a protected characteristic its a communitybased factor The question is whether this is a bias Since the policy is not openly disclosed its possible that the underwriters might be influenced by this even if its not explicitly stated The underwriters might have unconscious biases towards people who are part of the local community maybe because they feel more responsible or have better social networks"
