    "Text": "We are given an underfitting process tree that allows too much parallelism. The current model has a parallel block that includes: create_po, receive_goods, receive_invoice, match_invoice, pay_invoice. This allows these activities to occur in any order, which is not desired. For example, we cannot pay an invoice before receiving the goods or before the invoice is matched."

    "Text": "The intended standard logic is: 1. Create Purchase Requisition ... 8. Close Case. However, note that steps 4 and 5 (Receive Goods and Receive Invoice) might occur in any order? But step 6 (Match Invoice to PO) requires both the goods receipt and the invoice to be present? Actually, in a typical Procure-to-Pay process, the matching step requires both the goods receipt and the invoice. Therefore, we must have received both before matching."

    "Text": "So the structure should be: Sequence: Create_Purchase_Requisition, Approve_Purchase_Requisition, Create_Purchase_Order, Parallel (or interleaving) of Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice? But note: the matching step requires both, so we can use a parallel block for these two, but then we must have both finish before the next step. Then, we have two activities that can be done in any order, but both must be done: so we can use an AND (parallel) for Receive_Goods and Receive_Invoice."

    "Text": "But wait: is it possible to receive the invoice before the goods? Yes, but the matching step must wait for the goods. Similarly, if the goods are received first, then we wait for the invoice. So the parallel block for the two receive events is acceptable because they are independent and can happen in any order, but both must be completed."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "We want: create_req then approve_req then create_po then (receive_goods AND receive_invoice) then match_invoice then pay_invoice then close_case. So the corrected tree should be: Sequence: create_req, approve_req, create_po, Parallel (AND) for: receive_goods, receive_invoice, then match_invoice, pay_invoice, close_case. This ensures that the requisition is created and approved first. Then the purchase order is created. Then both the goods and the invoice must be received. Then the invoice is matched to the PO, then paid, and the case is closed."

Our parallel block allows that. But note: the matching step requires both, so we force both to be completed (via the parallel block) before the matching. This matches the intended behavior."
