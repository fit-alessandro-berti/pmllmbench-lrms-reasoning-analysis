Then D. Then IC and RP. ... For example, the Check Availability (CA) must happen before Reserve Items (RI), because you cant reserve items unless you check availability. So that's an Always Before constraint: CA must be before RI. Similarly, RI must be before PI, because you cant pick items unless they are reserved. So that's another Always Before: RI before PI. Then, PI must be before QC, since you check the quality of the picked items. So PI before QC. QC before PO, because you need to check quality before packing. Then PO before GSL, since you generate a label after packing. Then GSL before D, as you dispatch after the label is generated. Then D is before IC and RP? Or maybe IC and RP are separate steps. ... So maybe IC is after D, and RP is after IC? ... So IC is before RP."

Therefore, B must occur before A. So, the constraint is that B must be executed before A. Therefore, the Always Before constraint is that B is always before A. ... Wait, but the wording says if the first activity occurs, then the second activity should have been executed previously. So the first activity is A, and the second is B. Therefore, when A occurs, B must have already occurred. Therefore, B must be executed before A. ... But that's a bit counterintuitive. So, for example, if we have an Always Before constraint between CA and RI, then that would mean that CA must be executed before RI. Which is correct, because you check availability before reserving items. So, in this case, the Always Before constraints would be between CA and RI, RI and PI, PI and QC, QC and PO, PO and GSL, GSL and D, D and IC, IC and RP."

Alternatively, perhaps it's that if the first activity occurs, then the second activity must occur in the next event. But that's a directly-follows constraint. ...
