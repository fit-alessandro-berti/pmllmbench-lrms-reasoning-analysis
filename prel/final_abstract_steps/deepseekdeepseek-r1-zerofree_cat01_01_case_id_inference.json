Case 1 can be defined by patient_age: 45 and patient_gender: M. 2. Event 2: ... This is another Register patient event with a different patient_age and patient_gender, so it should be the start of a second case. Case 2 can be defined by patient_age: 62 and patient_gender: F. 3. Event 3: ... Another Register patient event but with yet another patient_age and patient_gender, so it should be the start of a third case. Case 3 can be defined by patient_age: 28 and patient_gender: M. 4. Event 4: ... This event has patient_age: 45 and patient_gender: M, matching Event 1. Thus, it should belong to Case 1. 5. Event 5: ... This event has patient_age: 62 and patient_gender: F, matching Event 2. Thus, it should belong to Case 2. 6. Event 6: ...

    "Text": "Based on the reasoning above, here is the grouping of events for each case based on the unique combinations of patient_age and patient_gender: ### Case 1 (patient_age: 45, patient_gender: M, started in ER department): 1. Event 1 (Register patient, 08:05:13, ER) 2. Event 4 (Initial triage, 08:10:50, ER) 3. Event 7 (X-ray imaging, 08:15:42, Radiology) 4. Event 12 (Doctor consultation, 08:23:10, ER) 5. Event 15 (Patient discharged, 08:30:05, ER) ### Case 2 (patient_age: 62, patient_gender: F, started in ER department): 1. Event 2 (Register patient, 08:07:02, ER) 2. Event 5 (Initial triage, 08:12:29, ER) 3. Event 8 (Lab test requested, 08:16:10, ER) 4. Event 10 (Lab test completed, 08:20:27, Laboratory) 5. Event 11 (Doctor consultation, 08:22:54, ER) 6. Event 14 (Prescription created, 08:27:00, ER) 7. Event 17 (Patient discharged, 08:35:29, ER) ### Case 3 (patient_age: 28, patient_gender: M, started in Surgery department): 1. Event 3 (Register patient, 08:07:15, Surgery) 2. Event 6 (Doctor consultation, 08:13:00, Surgery) 3. Event 9 (Surgery preparation, 08:16:45, Surgery) 4. Event 13 (Surgery performed, 08:25:19, Surgery) 5. Event 16 (Recovery room, 08:31:37, Surgery) 6. Event 18 (Patient discharged, 08:40:13, Surgery) Based on this reasoning, there appear to be three distinct cases identified here. However, a key part of this reasoning is that no two events belonging to the same case should have conflicting patient_age and patient_gender attributes. Thus, events are grouped based on a unique pair of patient_age and patient_gender values until a Patient discharged event indicates the likely end of a case."
