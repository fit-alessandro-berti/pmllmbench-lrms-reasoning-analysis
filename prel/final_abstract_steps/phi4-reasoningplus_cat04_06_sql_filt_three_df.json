    "Text": "We can compute lag and lead functions for each event. Then if activity is Create Order, then we want next event to have activity Confirm Order after previous events? But careful condition: Approve Purchase Requisition must come immediately before Create Order, which in turn must be immediately followed by Confirm Order. So its a chain of three rows. Thus, one way is: for each row that has Create Order, check if the previous event (lag) equals Approve Purchase Requisition and the next event (lead) equals Confirm Order. But wait careful: We want Approve Purchase Requisition immediately preceding Create Order. And then Confirm Order immediately following Create Order. So we can use lag over partition by case_id order by timestamp to check if previous event is Approve Purchase Requisition, and lead for next event equals Confirm Order. But then we must consider the timing difference between Create Order events timestamp and its Confirm Order event. And condition: The time difference should be > 5 days, i.e. confirm_date - create_order_timestamp > INTERVAL 5 days? However, note that if using DuckDB, date arithmetic is supported. We can compute lead as well. But careful: We have to check ordering by case_id and timestamp ascending."

But note: The sequence must be contiguous in the entire table. But if a row has Create Order, then its previous rows timestamp is automatically computed as lag (if it exists). That is valid only if they are consecutive. We need to check that the time difference between create_timestamp and confirm_timestamp is more than 5 days. Then we want to compute a distinct list of case_ids that meet this condition. But careful: The specification said Identify any case that contains sequence. And then among those, further refine selection to only those where time elapsed > 5 days. So if the same case has multiple sequences? Possibly more than one occurrence in same case maybe we consider them as separate events? But likely the question is simply if a given case ever shows this pattern (which might happen repeatedly) and the event difference condition holds, then exclude that entire cases events."

    "Text": "So final query: Exclude any rows whose case_id appears in the list of problematic cases. Thus steps: Step 1: Identify all problematic cases. We can do with subquery: SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM ( SELECT case_id, activity, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity, LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity, timestamp as create_time, LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time FROM event_log ) WHERE activity = Create Order AND prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition AND next_activity = Confirm Order AND (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 days But careful: We must check that lead timestamp exists. But if not exist, then next_event is null, so condition wont be satisfied. Then exclude those case_ids from event_log. So final query: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM ( ... ) subquery... ) But note: There might be a need for explicit type conversions if necessary. But we assume standard SQL. In DuckDB, the syntax is similar to standard SQL and supports INTERVAL 5 days or interval 5 day? Let me check: I think its likely that interval literal in DuckDB is supported with double quotes? However, since this is a query prompt, we can use it as INTERVAL 5 days because the original specification said more than 5 days. But I must check the correct syntax for intervals in duckdb. According to docs: In DuckDB, you can do timestamp + interval 5 days or similar. Alternatively, if using PostgreSQL style? Well, we assume standard SQL."

    "Text": "We might need a subquery that computes lag and lead values with window functions. So final query: WITH sequence AS ( SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp as create_time, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time, LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity, LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity FROM event_log ) SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM sequence WHERE activity = Create Order AND prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition AND next_activity = Confirm Order AND (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) Alternatively, we can do it in one query if needed. But careful: We have to ensure that the LAG and LEAD functions are applied with proper ordering. Also note that if an event is not part of any valid sequence then its safe to show them. But what about events within cases where some sequences might match but not all events? Actually, specification says: Your final query should return all events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and timing condition. So if a case has one instance of such triple event with > 5 days difference then exclude whole case. So indeed the logic is correct. Double-check ordering: Partition by case_id, order by timestamp ascending. That means that events occur in natural chronological order. Then for each row with activity Create Order, we check previous rows activity and next rows activity. But wait what if event log might not be strictly ordered? We assume that it is sorted by timestamp. Alternate approach: Using self-joins. We can also use three separate joins between event_log events, but then require contiguous ordering. However, using window functions is simpler."

    "Name": "Validation - PE",
    "Text": "Now let me check details: For each Create Order row (activity = Create Order), the previous row in the same case with timestamp less than currents timestamp must be exactly the one immediately preceding in order: if there is any gap between events? But if the sequence is direct, then the next events id will be immediately after. The window function with lag and lead is appropriate. Edge cases: What if a case has the following pattern but not contiguous? e.g., if there are some events between Approve Purchase Requisition and Create Order? Then they wont match because then previous event to Create Order wouldnt be exactly Approve Purchase Requisition. So thats fine. We need condition: (confirm_time - create_time) > 5 days. Use interval comparison in duckdb, i.e., we can do something like: WHERE confirm_time - create_time > INTERVAL 5 DAY maybe? But the prompt says more than 5 days, so it should be > 5 days. We need to check: (confirm_time - create_time) > INTERVAL 5 days. Im not sure if in duckdb we use interval syntax like that. There is a possibility that duckdb supports INTERVAL 5 DAY or INTERVAL 5 days? Let me check: In DuckDB, you can subtract two TIMESTAMP values and get a TIME interval. I check: in PostgreSQL, timestamp difference returns an interval type, but sometimes comparison operators work with intervals if the other side is an interval literal. But in duckdb documentation, I think it supports timestamp - timestamp returns a interval. Let me assume that works fine. Alternatively, we can use: WHERE (confirm_time - create_time).days > 5. But Im not sure if DuckDB supports property extraction from intervals. There is a function extract(day FROM interval). Possibly yes. But the prompt says more than 5 days, so likely its simpler to do: WHERE extract(day from confirm_time - create_time) > 5. I need to check syntax: In Postgres, you use EXTRACT(DAY FROM interval) but I think duckdb might also support that. But the prompt says SQL query so likely the simplest is to do: WHERE (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 days. Yes. Alternatively, if not, then we can do: WHERE date(timestamp) difference. But Ill assume its okay. I must check grouping: The final result is simply all events from event_log where case_id is not in the subquery. That means use NOT IN, but sometimes its better to use a left join that is null. But Ill keep it simple."

    "Text": "Thus answer: WITH valid_sequences AS ( SELECT DISTINCT case_id, timestamp as create_order_time, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_order_time FROM event_log WHERE activity = Create Order ), sequences AS ( SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id FROM valid_sequences s JOIN event_log el_prev ON el_prev.case_id = s.case_id AND el_prev.timestamp < s.create_order_time -- But then we need to check contiguous? This is tricky with join. ) Wait, no: Ill just use window functions as originally planned. We want to compute for each row in the log: - prev_activity = LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) - next_activity = LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) - create_time = timestamp if activity = Create Order - confirm_time = LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) Then filter rows where: activity = Create Order, prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition, next_activity = Confirm Order AND (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL 5 days That gives us problematic cases. But careful: What if the next_activity is not exactly next row? Because maybe the sequence is broken up by a null event because of no following activity. But we assume that if theres no following event then lead returns null, and condition will fail. I must check using window function ordering: The order by timestamp in partition by case_id ensures contiguous events are ordered by their occurrence time. So it is the correct method. Thus code: WITH sequences AS ( SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp as event_time, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity, LAG(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_timestamp, -- might be optional LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_timestamp FROM event_log ) SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN ( SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id FROM sequences s WHERE s.activity = Create Order AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order AND (s.next_timestamp - s.event_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) That seems to be correct. I need to check syntax: INTERVAL 5 days might not be supported in duckdb. Possibly we use interval 5 day but Ill assume the prompt is using standard SQL with intervals. Alternatively, if duckdb does not support that, then one can do: WHERE extract(day from (s.next_timestamp - s.event_time)) > 5 I can check: In DuckDB, theres a function called date_diff maybe. But I think its best to use the interval literal. We need proper grouping and ordering: The final result set is all events that are not in problematic case_ids. Alternatively, we could do: SELECT e.* FROM event_log e LEFT JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id FROM ( SELECT case_id, activity, timestamp as create_time, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity FROM event_log ) s WHERE s.activity = Create Order AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order AND (s.confirm_time - s.create_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL This join approach may be better because it avoids using NOT IN which might cause problems if there are null values. Ill check: In some databases, using NOT IN can lead to issues with null values. But here we want to exclude those cases. Using left join and then filtering by seq.case_id is null is standard method. So final query: SELECT e.* FROM event_log e LEFT JOIN ( SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id FROM ( SELECT  case_id, activity, timestamp as create_time, LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_time, LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity, LEAD(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity FROM event_log ) s WHERE s.activity = Create Order   AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition   AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order   AND (s.confirm_time - s.create_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL That is a valid query. I need to check the syntax for INTERVAL in duckdb: Possibly its written as INTERVAL 5 DAY but Im not 100% sure. But prompt says more than 5 days, so Ill assume that is correct. Alternatively, if there are any issues with that, we can use extract(day from (s.confirm_time - s.create_time)) > 5. Thus final answer: SELECT e.* FROM event_log e LEFT JOIN (     SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id     FROM (         SELECT              case_id,             activity,             timestamp as create_order_time,             LEAD(timestamp) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,             LAG(activity, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,             LEAD(activity, 1) OVER(PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity         FROM event_log     ) s     WHERE s.activity = Create Order       AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition       AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order       AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) AS seq ON e.case_id = seq.case_id WHERE seq.case_id IS NULL Yes. Ill produce final query with explanation. I must also include a detailed explanation, if needed. I need to note that the inner subquery is used to identify problematic cases, and then we exclude them using left join filtering by seq.case_id is null. Also mention window functions are used. Lets now produce answer in plain text as response message. Ill not use markdown formatting since instructions said by default, do not reply with Markdown unless requested? Actually the prompt is formatted with double asterisks? But instruction says: By default, do not use markdown formatting unless requested? Wait re-read instructions: By default, do not include Markdown unless requested but our conversation has markdown formatting in original query. It is ambiguous. I have to produce final answer. Ill produce the SQL code block inside triple backticks if needed? The assistant said to use plain text unless requested. But note the conversation says Please ensure proper grouping, ordering. So I must produce code with explanation and then code. Ill produce answer as a plain text answer with no markdown formatting but Ill include code blocks. But instructions say by default do not output markdown formatting, so I can produce plain text SQL query. Ill produce the query using left join version. Or maybe use NOT IN version is simpler. Let me check: Using NOT IN might be simpler: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (   SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id   FROM (      SELECT          case_id,          activity,          timestamp as create_order_time,          LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,          LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,          LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity      FROM event_log   ) s   WHERE s.activity = Create Order     AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition     AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order     AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ) This is simpler. I must note that the ordering of window functions: I must use ORDER BY timestamp because events in the same case are ordered by time. This query should be correct. But I need to check if the INTERVAL 5 days part is valid syntax in duckdb. If not, then alternative method: WHERE extract(day from (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time)) > 5 might be used. Let me consider potential pitfalls: - What if there are multiple sequences within same case? Then we want to exclude the entire case. - The query uses DISTINCT on subquery to ensure one row per case. That is correct. Ill produce answer with explanation and then code. I must also mention ordering: It orders by timestamp in partition of each case id. And then filter for activity Create Order such that previous event equals Approve Purchase Requisition AND next event equals Confirm Order. Then condition on time difference > 5 days. Yes. Ill produce final answer accordingly. Ill produce answer as plain text: Answer: The following query uses a subquery with window functions to identify cases that meet the specified criteria and then excludes them from the final result set. The inner query computes lag and lead for each event, then filters rows where the current row is Create Order that immediately follows an Approve Purchase Requisition and precedes a Confirm Order, with time difference greater than 5 days. Then using NOT IN operator, we filter out events from those cases. SQL Query: SELECT * FROM event_log WHERE case_id NOT IN (     SELECT DISTINCT s.case_id     FROM (         SELECT              case_id,             activity,             timestamp AS create_order_time,             LEAD(timestamp) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS confirm_order_time,             LAG(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS prev_activity,             LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) AS next_activity         FROM event_log     ) s     WHERE s.activity = Create Order       AND s.prev_activity = Approve Purchase Requisition       AND s.next_activity = Confirm Order       AND (s.confirm_order_time - s.create_order_time) > INTERVAL 5 days ); That is the final answer. I must now produce final result. Ill produce final output accordingly."
