We need to write a DuckDB SQL query that identifies any case (case_id) that contains three activities in direct succession:\n- 'Approve Purchase Requisition'\n- 'Create Order'\n- 'Confirm Order'\n\nThese events must appear in this exact order, with no other event from the same case in between them.\n\n2. Among those cases that have this specific sequence, further refine selection to only those where time elapsed between 'Create Order' and 'Confirm Order' is more than 5 days.\n3. After identifying such cases, exclude them from final result. Return events from event_log except those that belong to cases matching both the specified sequence and timing condition.\n\nWe need a query that returns all events from event_log except events whose case_id meets above criteria."

    "Text": "We need to find sequence of three consecutive rows per case sorted by timestamp (or maybe not timestamp but if they are sequential events then ordering by event id or simply use row_number with partitioning by case_id and sorting by timestamp). But we must check direct succession, i.e. no other event in between them from the same case, meaning that the sequence should be contiguous.\n\nApproach: We can compute lag and lead functions for each event. Then if activity is 'Create Order', then we want next event to have activity 'Confirm Order' after previous events? But careful condition: Approve Purchase Requisition must come immediately before Create Order, which in turn must be immediately followed by Confirm Order. So it's a chain of three rows.\n\nThus, one way is: for each row that has Create Order, check if the previous event (lag) equals 'Approve Purchase Requisition' and the next event (lead) equals 'Confirm Order'. ... We can use lag over partition by case_id order by timestamp to check if previous event is Approve Purchase Requisition, and lead for next event equals 'Confirm Order'."

But likely the question is simply if a given case ever shows this pattern (which might happen repeatedly) and the event difference condition holds, then exclude that entire case's events.\n\nSo final query: Exclude any rows whose case_id appears in the list of problematic cases.\n\nThus steps:\nStep 1: Identify all problematic cases. We can do with subquery:\n\nSELECT DISTINCT\n   case_id\nFROM (\n   SELECT\n       case_id,\n       activity,\n       LAG(activity) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as prev_activity,\n       LEAD(activity, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as next_activity,\n       timestamp as create_time,\n       LEAD(timestamp, 1) OVER (PARTITION BY case_id ORDER BY timestamp) as confirm_time\n   FROM event_log\n)\nWHERE activity = 'Create Order'\nAND prev_activity = 'Approve Purchase Requisition'\nAND next_activity = 'Confirm Order'\nAND (confirm_time - timestamp) > INTERVAL '5 days'\n\n\nThen exclude those case_ids from event_log.\nSo final query:\n\nSELECT * FROM event_log\nWHERE case_id NOT IN (\n  SELECT DISTINCT case_id FROM ( ... ) subquery...\n)"

Answer: The following query uses a subquery with window functions to identify cases that meet the specified criteria and then excludes them from the final result set.
