Here they package before authorizing payment, which violates Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping. Also authorize payment after packaging is also violation (should be before). However they still authorize before shipping but after packaging. So violation: authorize payment after packaging; also package before authorization. Also after check, expected next is authorize payment before packaging; here they package first. So case 2 violates. Also any other issues? They still authorize payment before shipping, which is okay, but the ordering of package vs authorize is reversed. Also they close after shipping, okay."

    "Text": "3: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Cancel order, Ship order, Close order. Here they cancel after authorize payment, but then they still ship order after cancellation. That is definitely a violation: shipping should not occur after cancellation; also cancel should lead to close, not continue to ship. Also authorize payment before cancel is okay? In cancellation scenario, after check inventory insufficient, they should go directly to Cancel order, then Close order. Here they authorize payment before cancel, which is not typical; also they still ship after cancel. So multiple violations."

    "Text": "5: Sequence: Receive, Check, Authorize payment, Ship order, Close order. Missing Package items. The normative says after authorization, items should be prepared for shipment (Package items) before shipping. So shipping before packaging is a violation. Also package step omitted; but is it a violation? The description says Package items should only occur after authorization and before shipping, since items must be prepared before they can be shipped. So shipping without packaging is a violation. Also they never package. So case 5 violates."

    "Text": "Thus violated cases: 2, 3, 5. Now need explanation referencing textual description and interpreting ambiguities. Potential nuance: case 2 also includes authorize payment after package, but still before shipping; but normative expects authorize before package. So violation. Case 3 also includes authorize payment before cancel, but also shipping after cancel; both violations. Case 5 missing package step; but maybe could be considered acceptable if packaging is implicit? But normative explicitly says package items must occur after authorization and before shipping. So it is a violation. Also case 1 is fine. Now produce answer."
