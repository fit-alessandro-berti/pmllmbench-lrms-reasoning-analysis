The addition of edges like Screen- Decide, Screen-Interview, Decide- Onboard, Onboard- Payroll, Payroll- Close. So that's a normal sequence. No obvious anomalies here. All transitions are in place, so maybe no issues."

Then xor_payroll, which is an exclusive choice between Payroll and skip. So normally, Payroll should be executed, but here they're choosing between Payroll and skip. But in the standard, Payroll is the main activity. So maybe this is an anomaly because it's not following the normal logic. Also, the xor makes the Payroll and skip options, which in the standard there's no choice, so this is a deviation."
