Lets analyze the model: The model consists of the following nodes: ... The structure is: successful_subtree: a parallel operator with children authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order cancel_subtree: a sequence operator with children cancel_order, close_order xor_node: an XOR operator with children successful_subtree, cancel_subtree root: a sequence operator with children receive_order, check_inventory, xor_node, close_order"

    "Text": "Wait, note that the root sequence includes xor_node and then close_order. But note that the cancel_subtree already includes close_order. Similarly, the successful_subtree does not include close_order? ... So the overall sequence is: receive_order -> check_inventory -> xor_node -> close_order. But note: the xor_node is either successful_subtree or cancel_subtree. The successful_subtree is parallel of authorize_payment, package_items, ship_order. The cancel_subtree is sequence of cancel_order and close_order. But then after the xor_node, we have close_order in the root. So the close_order appears twice?"

So the model should have exactly one close_order. But here, because the root also has close_order, we get an extra close_order in the cancel case."

    "Text": "This trace includes two Close Order activities. According to the domain description, regardless of whether the order is successful or canceled, the process should end with a single Close Order activity. The model erroneously allows Close Order to occur twice in the cancel path because the cancel_subtree contains a Close Order activity and the root sequence also includes a Close Order activity after the XOR choice."
