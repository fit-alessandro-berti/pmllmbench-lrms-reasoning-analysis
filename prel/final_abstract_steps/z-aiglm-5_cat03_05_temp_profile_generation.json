The process has 10 activities: SS, OP, RC, QI, CA, PT, PK, WS, DT, AS. **Key definitions from the prompt:** 1.  **Temporal Profile**: A model describing the average and standard deviation of the times between *couples of activities that eventually follow each other*. This means for a trace `<A, B, C, D>`, we consider `(A,B)`, `(A,C)`, `(A,D)`, `(B,C)`, `(B,D)`, `(C,D)`. It's not just direct successors."

Let's say 2-4 weeks. *   **RC (Receive Components) to QI (Quality Inspection):** Short. Unloading and checking. Hours or a day. *   **QI (Quality Inspection) to CA (Component Assembly):** Short/Medium. Moving to line. Maybe 1 day. *   **CA (Component Assembly) to PT (Product Testing):** Short. Continuous flow. Maybe hours. *   **PT (Product Testing) to PK (Packaging):** Immediate/Short. Hours. *   **PK (Packaging) to WS (Warehouse Storage):** Short. Hours. *   **WS (Warehouse Storage) to DT (Distribution):** Variable. Depends on shipping schedules. Days to weeks. Let's say 1 week average. *   **DT (Distribution) to AS (After-Sales Support):** Very long. This is the usage phase. Months or years. *Wait*, looking at standard process logs, usually AS happens after a significant delay relative to the manufacturing steps."
