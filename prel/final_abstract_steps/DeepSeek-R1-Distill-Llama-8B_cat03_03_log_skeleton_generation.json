I'll take it step by step. First, let's list out all the activities involved: RO, CA, RI, PI, QC, PO, GSL, D, IC, RP."

Looking at the process, activities like RO, CA, RI seem to be part of the initial order processing. Maybe RO, CA, RI should all have the same frequency. Similarly, the packing and shipping steps (PO, GSL, D) might need to be the same. QC and IC could also be paired for equivalence."

    "Text": "2. **Always Before**: This constraint applies if one activity occurs, the other must have happened earlier. For example, RO must always come before CA because you can't check availability until you've received the order. Similarly, after PO, GSL must come as you need the label before dispatching. So, I'll pair RO with CA, RI with PI, and CA with RI. Also, after QC, you can't have PO yet, so QC is always before PO. PO is always before GSL, which is always before D."

Also, after PI, QC is next, so (PI, QC). After QC, PO comes, so (QC, PO). After PO, GSL and D should follow, so (PO, GSL) and (PO, D). Similarly, after GSL, D must come, so (GSL, D). Also, after IC, RP happens, so (IC, RP)."

Wait, no, that doesn't make sense. Maybe some activities shouldn't happen together. For instance, after receiving the order, you can't have QC until after PI. So perhaps RI and QC can't be together, or CA and PI. I'm not sure. Maybe I'll need to think about which pairs can't be in the same case."

    "Text": "5. **Activity Occurrences**: This sets the allowed number of times each activity can occur. For example, RO can happen 0 or 1 times, CA can happen 0 or 1, etc. Depending on the process, some activities might always happen once, others might happen multiple times, but in this scenario, each activity is a step in a linear process, so they might each occur once. But perhaps some can have multiple, like if there are multiple orders being processed, but since it's a single order, maybe each activity is once. So I'll set each activity to have {0,1} occurrences, but some might need higher, but for now, let's assume 0 or 1."

    "Text": "6. **Directly Follows Constraints**: These mean if an activity occurs, the next one must follow immediately. For example, if RI happens, PI must come right after. So I'll have pairs like (RI, PI), (PI, QC), (QC, PO), (PO, GSL), (GSL, D), (D, IC), (IC, RP). Wait, but in the process, after D, it's IC, and after IC, RP. So yes, those should be directly followed."
