    "Text": "First, the process starts with the patient arriving (A), then registration (RG), followed by intake assessment (IA). These are in sequence, so Ill group them as a sequence operator. After IA, the patient goes through triage, which is another sequence: triage interview (TI) and triage classification (TC). So thats another sequence node under the initial sequence."

    "Text": "Following the initial diagnostic test, theres a loop. The loop starts with Specialist Consultation (SC), followed by an exclusive choice between Targeted Medication (TM) and Specialized Physical Therapy (SPT). After treatment, theres another exclusive choice for the re-diagnostic test: Follow-up ECG (FCE) or Follow-up Blood Analysis (FBA). The loop continues if the results are abnormal, so the loop condition is based on the re-diagnostic test results."

    "Text": "After the loop ends (when results are normal), theres a parallel activity: Advanced Imaging (AI) and Nutritional Counseling (NC). Then, a sequence of Follow-up Appointment Scheduling (FAS) and Detailed Discharge Instructions (DDI). Finally, three parallel activities: Billing (BL), Insurance Claims Processing (ICP), and Medical Records Finalization (MRF)."

    "Text": "Putting it all together, Ill structure each part with the appropriate operators, making sure to set parents correctly for each node. Ill use the ProcessTree constructor with the right operator and parent references, appending children as needed. I need to ensure the loop is correctly structured, with SC, the treatment choice, RDT, and the condition to loop back. The RDT itself is another XOR, deciding between FCE and FBA. The loop continues until RDT results are normal. I should also make sure that the parallel activities are correctly represented with the PARALLEL operator, and sequences are properly nested."

I think thats the structure. Now, Ill translate this into the code, making sure each nodes parent is set correctly and children are appended properly."
