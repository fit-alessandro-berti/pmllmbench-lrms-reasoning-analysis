    "Text": "Hmm, the first few events seem to be about getting the material ready. Like retrieving, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating. Those could be part of 'Material Preparation'. The next part is picking up the welding tool and doing the actual welding. Those might be 'Assembly' or 'Welding Assembly'. Then after welding, there's a measurement of weld integrity, which sounds like a quality check. Then applying coating and drying, which might be 'Coating Application' or 'Surface Treatment'. Finally, the visual check by Operator C is another quality step, maybe 'Final Quality Inspection'."

    "Text": "Wait, but the measure weld integrity and apply coating are separate. Are they part of different steps? Let me check the sequence again. After welding, they measure the integrity, then apply coating, then dry, then visual check. So maybe 'Quality Inspection' happens after welding, then coating steps, and then another inspection. Or maybe the coating and drying are part of a 'Coating and Drying' step, and both the integrity measurement and visual check are quality steps but at different stages."

    "Text": "Looking at the first group: - Retrieve raw metal sheet (Operator A) - Scan barcode (Operator A) - Place on table (Operator A) - Align (Robot Arm #2) - Preheat (Heating Unit #1) These all seem to be preparing the material before any assembly. So 'Material Preparation' makes sense here. The next steps: - Pick up welding tool (Operator B) - Weld corner A (Operator B) - Weld corner B (Operator B) These are done by Operator B using a welding tool. So this is the actual assembly or welding process. So 'Welding Assembly'. Then: - Measure weld integrity (Quality Sensor #1) This is a quality check after welding. So maybe 'Post-Welding Quality Check'. Then: - Apply protective coating (Coating Unit #3) - Dry coating (Heating Unit #2) These are about applying and drying the coating, so 'Coating Application' or 'Surface Treatment'. Finally: - Visual check (Operator C) Which is a final inspection, so 'Final Quality Inspection'."

    "Text": "But wait, the measure weld integrity is a quality check, and the visual check is another. Should they be grouped together? Or are they separate because they happen at different stages? Since measure weld integrity is right after welding and specific to the weld, whereas the visual check is after coating and drying, maybe they are separate quality steps."

The time between preheating (08:00:20) and picking up the tool (08:01:00) is 40 seconds. Maybe that's a natural split. Then welding steps are all within 20 seconds. Then the quality check at 08:01:20, followed by coating steps, and final check."

    "Name": "Deductive Reasoning - PE",
    "Text": "Now, the justification for each group: 1. Material Preparation: All steps related to getting the raw material ready for the next processes. This includes retrieval, scanning, placing, aligning, and preheating. These are all initial steps done by Operator A, Robot Arm, and Heating Unit. They are preparatory and ensure the material is correctly positioned and heated. 2. Welding Assembly: Involves picking up the welding tool and performing the welds. These are core assembly steps done by Operator B, transforming the prepared material into an assembled product. 3. Post-Welding Quality Check: Immediately after welding, a quality sensor measures the weld integrity. This is a critical check to ensure the welds meet standards before proceeding. 4. Coating Application: Applying the protective coating and drying it. These steps protect the product and are done by Coating Unit and Heating Unit. They are a separate phase focused on surface treatment. 5. Final Quality Inspection: A visual check by Operator C to ensure the final product meets quality standards, including coating and overall appearance. This grouping considers temporal sequence, resource types, and logical process phases. Each high-level step represents a distinct stage in manufacturing, from preparation to assembly, quality checks, coating, and final inspection."
