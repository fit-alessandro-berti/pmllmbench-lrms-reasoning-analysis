Lets compute: 08:05 to 08:05 next day = 24h, then to 09:15 = +1h10m => total 25h10m = 1510 minutes. Actually 24h = 1440 min, plus 1h10 = 70 min, total 1510 min. Case 103: receive 08:10, close 09:30 same day => 1h20m = 80 min. Case 104: receive 08:20, close 08:30 next day => from 08:20 day1 to 08:20 day2 = 24h, then to 08:30 = +10m => total 24h10m = 1450 min. Case 105: receive 08:25, close 09:30 day3? Actually close on 2024-03-03 09:30, receive on 03-01 08:25. Thats about 2 days 1h5m? Lets compute: from 08:25 day1 to 08:25 day2 = 24h, to 08:25 day3 = 48h. Then to 09:30 day3 = +1h5m? Actually 09:30 - 08:25 = 1h5m. So total 49h5m = 2945 min."

Also escalation to level-2. Case 104 has wait after assign (09:30 to 13:00) before investigation, then resolve next day. Case 105 has multiple delays: after assign 09:00 to escalation 10:00 same day, then investigation 14:00 same day, then resolve next day 09:00. Also double investigation? Actually after escalation they still investigate again? It says Investigate Issue again at 14:00 same day, then resolve next day."
