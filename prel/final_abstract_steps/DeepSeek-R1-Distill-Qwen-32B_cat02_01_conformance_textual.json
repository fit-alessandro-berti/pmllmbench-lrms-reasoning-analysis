If the inventory is sufficient, the next steps are to authorize payment, package items, ship the order, and then close it. If the inventory is insufficient, after checking, it should cancel the order and then close it. So, the two main paths are: 1. Inventory sufficient: Receive Check Authorize Package Ship Close 2. Inventory insufficient: Receive Check Cancel Close."

Wait, after Check comes Package, but according to the normative process, after Check, it should be Authorize before Packaging. So here, Packaging happens before Authorizing payment. That's a violation because Authorize should come before Package. So Case 2 is deviating."
