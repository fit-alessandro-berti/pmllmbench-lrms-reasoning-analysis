After AE, there's an optional loop where they might Request Missing Info (RMI) and then Validate Form again. This can happen once or multiple times (like in Case 3). Once that's done, it proceeds to Approval Decision (AD), Send Confirmation (SC), and Archive Case (AC)."

    "Text": "Let me cross-check with Case 1: After AE comes one instance of RMI followed by VF, then proceeds to AD, SC, AC. Matches the structure. Case 2: After AE, skips RMI and VF entirely, proceeds. Matches the structure. Case 3: Two RMIs occur consecutively before a VF and then proceeds. The structure allows inner iterations of * operator to account for multiple RMIs prior to VF in a single loop iteration."
