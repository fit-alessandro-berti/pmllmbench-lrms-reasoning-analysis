    "Text": "Hmm that complicates things because according to previous cases like case 1 and case 3 here sometimes after an RMI theres a VF again But case 3 has two RMIs before a single VF This might indicate that my initial assumption about the loop structure is incorrect Alternatively maybe each iteration of the loop allows for multiple RMIs as long as eventually theres a VF Hmm this complicates things because according to standard process tree semantics for loops operator Alternatively maybe I need to model it as follows After AE comes a loop where each iteration can have one or more RMIs but must end with a VF before proceeding back into checking whether to loop again Alternatively perhaps inside the loop body we have an XOR between doing nothing or doing RMI VF multiple times Alternatively maybe I need to structure it as follows After AE comes a loop where each iteration consists of XOR between exiting or doing some actions leading back into another iteration"
